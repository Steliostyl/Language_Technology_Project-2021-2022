AT&amp;T said it plans to cover as many as 75 million people with its C-band network by the end of the year.</p>", "<p>The rollout brings to fruition major 5G investments from both carriers. Verizon spent $45.5 billion in <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/31/5g-spectrum-auction-bids-total-80point9-billion-winners-revealed-soon.html\">a government auction last year</a> to secure the rights to the wavelengths it's using for its network. AT&amp;T spent more than $23 billion. The carriers have since spent additional billions to actually build the networks and install equipment on cell towers.</p>", "<p>\"We've invested — just to get the spectrum, some $40-odd billion. And then we've also had to kick money into the kitty to help clear the spectrum. So you know, we're looking upward of $53 billion,\" Verizon CTO Kyle Malady told CNBC. Verizon will spend $10 billion over the next three years to continue building its network, he said.</p>", "<p>Some forms of 5G were already available to wireless subscribers in the U.S.</p>", "<p>Verizon and AT&amp;T already offer two classes of service they market as 5G. Low-band service covers large areas, but only at about the same speeds as before, while millimeter-wave service offers much higher speeds, but only over small areas, such as street corners or sports stadiums.</p>", "<p><a href=\"//www.cnbc.com/quotes/TMUS\" target=\"_blank\">T-Mobile</a>, the third major carrier, has offered \"mid-band\" 5G since 2020 using different spectrum on the 2.5GHz band it acquired when it bought Sprint. T-Mobile says its network covers 186 million people in the U.S.</p>", "<p>But the C-band networks going online Wednesday are different. They use newly available wavelengths, between 2.7 and 3.98GHz, that are capable of both traveling long distances and carrying enough data to deliver faster internet connections.</p>", "<p>The unique properties of these wavelengths led to their substantial price at auction, and they were often called the \"Goldilocks band\" in the industry because they are perfectly situated for 5G services.</p>", "<p>\"It's excellent right down the middle. You have a great amount of bandwidth, it propagates well and it goes through buildings,\" Malady said. \"I give credit to the U.S. government, they put a lot of spectrum up for auction. This rarely comes along. And that's why we were so aggressive in the auction to get this.\"</p>", "<p>The C-band networks were supposed to be turned on in December, but the rollout was delayed twice because of Federal Aviation Administration concerns that their wavelengths could interfere with tools pilots use to land safely.</p>", "<p>Verizon and AT&amp;T both said on Tuesday that they would <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/18/5g-deployment-delays-at-airports-on-cancellation-threats.html\">delay launching the service near airports</a> while the issues are resolved, but that their new networks would be turned on everywhere else.</p>", "<p>\"We are frustrated by the FAA's inability to do what nearly 40 countries have done, which is to safely deploy 5G technology without disrupting aviation services, and we urge it do so in a timely manner,\" an AT&amp;T spokesperson said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>", "<p>Now Verizon and AT&amp;T will need to show that these investments can pay off in the form of better wireless service to encourage customers to opt for more expensive 5G plans and open new markets, such as households replacing cable internet access.</p>", "<p>\"Where's the return on 5G investment?\" asked Credit Suisse analysts last October. \"The generational change from 4G to 5G has led to more capable wireless networks, but the benefits to operators seem less than hoped (and less than hyped.)\"</p>", "<p>\"While 5G defensively helps networks keep up with traffic and consumer expectations, it is not the factor pulling consumers up operators' tier lineup,\" Credit Suisse analyst Douglas Mitchelson wrote.</p>", "<p>Verizon announced earlier this month new plans that <a href=\"https://www.verizon.com/about/news/power-verizon-5g-ultra-wideband-coming\" target=\"_blank\">include 5G service with unlimited data</a>. AT&amp;T unlimited plans <a href=\"https://www.att.com/techbuzz/buying-guides/upgrading-to-a-5g-phone-make-sure-you-have-a-5g-plan-too/\" target=\"_blank\">also include access to 5G service</a>.</p>", "<p>Malady said that Verizon's rollout could take as long as 12 hours as the network lights up from the East Coast to the West Coast.</p>", "<p>People with compatible phones could see the network symbol at the top of their smartphone screen change Wednesday and access peak download speeds 10 times faster than an LTE network, according to the carriers.</p>", "<p>For Verizon subscribers connecting to the new network, they will see \"5Guw,\" for 5G ultra-wideband. AT&amp;T subscribers will see \"5G+.\"</p>", "<p>Phones that can support the new network include <a href=\"//www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL\" target=\"_blank\">Apple</a>'s iPhone 12 and iPhone 13, newer Samsung Galaxy phones, and Google's Pixel 6. Users will also need to be on a plan that includes 5G service.</p>"]},

Organic revenue, which strips out the impact of foreign currency, acquisitions and divestitures, also rose 6% in the quarter.

(Roth IRAs have no required withdrawals until after the account owner's death.)</p>", "<p>Prior to the Secure Act taking effect in 2020, RMDs were generally required once a person hit age 70½. Now, for anyone who reached that age in 2020 (or will reach it later), RMDs kick in at age 72. In other words, if you were born July 1, 1949, or later, you can wait until age 72, Slott said.</p>", "<p>The amount you must withdraw each year is generally determined by dividing the previous year-end balance of each qualifying account by a \"life expectancy factor\" as defined by the IRS. The agency's new tables assume you'll live longer, which may have the effect of reducing the amount you need to withdraw.</p>", "<p>\"They give you about one to two years more in life expectancy,\" Slott said.</p>", "<p>Under the new uniform life table, for example, a 75-year-old would use 24.6 as their factor. If the account balance is, say, $500,000, dividing the amount by that factor results in an RMD of about $20,325. </p>", "<p>Under the old table, the factor for a 75-year-old was 22.9, or $21,834 for a $500,000 account. </p>", "<p>One thing to be careful about involves anyone who turned 72 in the second half of last year. (Someone reaching that age in the first half of 2021 would have been subject to the RMD age of 70½.)</p>", "<p>Basically, in a person's first year of RMDs, that required withdrawal can be delayed up until April 1 of the following year (although this means having two RMDs in a single year). So if you delayed your 2021 RMD to take advantage of that rule, be sure to use the proper account balances and life expectancy tables.</p>", "<p>That is, your 2021 RMD would be based on the old life expectancy tables and the account's balance on Dec. 31, 2020. Your 2022 RMD would be based on the new tables and the balance at the end of 2021.</p>", "<p>For inherited IRAs, calculating RMDs is handled differently.</p>", "<p>The Secure Act eliminated the ability of most beneficiaries to stretch out withdrawals across their own lifetime (the so-called \"stretch IRA\") if the original account owner died in 2020 or later.</p>", "<p>Now, unless they meet an exception, beneficiaries are required to withdraw all assets from the inherited account by Dec. 31 of the 10th year following the account owner's death.</p>", "<p>Exceptions to that rule include when the beneficiary is a surviving spouse, a minor child of the account owner (at least until they reach the age of majority, usually 18), a disabled beneficiary or one who is not more than 10 years younger than the original account owner. These beneficiaries can still stretch out payments based on their life expectancy.</p>", "<p>Additionally, beneficiaries who had an inherited account before 2020 and were using the stretch provision can continue to do so, Slott said. </p>", "<p>Either way, the method for determining your RMDs from an inherited account is different (and spouses have several options). In the first year, you look at the factor for your age in the single life table. In the next year you reduce that original factor by one, and then continue subtracting one in each subsequent year.</p>", "<p>This year, you get a one-time reset: Look at the factor in the single life table for the age you were when you began taking those RMDs and reduce that number by one for each year that has passed.</p>", "<p>\"It's looking at it as if the new table was in effect when you inherited the account,\" Slott said. \"But it doesn't affect the RMDs you've taken since then.\"</p>", "<p>Once you do the reset, you continue reducing your factor by one each year.</p>"]},
