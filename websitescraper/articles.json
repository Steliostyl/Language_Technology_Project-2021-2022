The sister of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was speaking at the Global Supertrends Conference 2022 on Wednesday. The Web3 is a hypothetical, future version of the internet based on blockchain technology \u2014 an \"ideal utopia,\" said Zuckerberg. \"But \u2026 that's not what's happening. What's happening in reality, is chaos.\" The founder and CEO of Zuckerberg Media, a production company and marketing consultancy, added, \"You're the only one watching your own back and your own assets, people are spending time protecting themselves by setting up so many different wallets and protecting their identity and that's not contributing to development in the area.\" Zuckerberg, who was an early employee at Meta \u2014 formerly known as Facebook \u2014 explained that various metaverses are now acting as \"their own walled garden,\" in which users are unable to use their assets across platforms. The metaverse can be loosely defined as a virtual world where people live, work and play. With cryptocurrency, users can buy and develop virtual land or dress their own avatars. \"Right now, I'm on Decentraland, my son is on Roblox, my other son is on Fortnite. That's great \u2014 we're all in the metaverse. [But] we have no interaction with one another,\" she said. \"In order to really unlock the potential [of Web3], we're going to need to figure out a system where there's interoperability. What you have goes with you wherever you are, [and] we're not there yet,\" Zuckerberg added. However, according to Zuckerberg, that's easier said than done because no company running a metaverse right now wants to give up control or \"share that ownership.\" \"That's why it's not we're not seeing that kind of consumer mainstream adoption yet because there needs to be a world where you leave the house with one wallet. And you need to see that same behavior online also.\" She added that Web3 needs experts who have been involved in the global banking system and Web2 \u2014 the internet that we know today \u2014 to lend a \"protective layer.\" The need for such experts is all the more important because it has been \"too easy\" for users to be scammed or lose all their assets in Web3, said Zuckerberg. \"There needs to be more protections for consumers \u2026 I think we will wind up [with] web 2.7, where there is some centralization, keeping people safe, but the ability to port your assets with you to any site.\" Another thing that needs to be improved in Web3 is user-friendliness, she added. \"It should not take 45 steps to set up a cryptocurrency wallet, buy a currency and enter the metaverse. It needs to [be] one-stop, beginner-friendly.\" The metaverse may still be in its infancy, but Zuckerberg pointed out that sectors like real estate will be \"extremely valuable.\" \"Wherever there's scarcity \u2026 there's value. I think the big question will just be, is there scarcity in the metaverse and if there is, there will be value in real estate there,\" she added. According to data from MetaMetrics Solutions, real estate sales in the metaverse surpassed $500 million in 2021 and could double in 2022. Zuckerberg said that education and training will be another \"huge area\" for opportunities and revenue. \"Especially in this new age where workers are remote, it is very difficult to upskill remote workers \u2026 I think training in the metaverse, education in an interactive way, is going to become crucial for every business that has a remote work,\" she added. \"We're really just scratching the surface of what we're going to see.\""},

He was speaking at the 2022 Global Supertrends Conference. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced in May that the country will take firm steps to restart idled nuclear power plants to stabilize energy supply and prices. In 2011, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami, which killed nearly 16,000 people and caused the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986. Though there have been reservations among the Japanese public over the use of nuclear energy, particularly when it comes to the issue of safety, Tanaka said the future of nuclear power is now safer, and stressed the importance of minimizing risk and maintaining \"peaceful use.\" Tanaka attributed the increase in public support to the possibility of \"serious problems by the end of this year\" if Japan does not have nuclear power. He added that Russia supplies 9% of Japan's natural gas, and losing that supply could spell trouble for the country as it would have to turn to alternative sources, which would lead to a spike in energy prices. Japan has repeatedly criticized Russian aggression in Ukraine and has slapped Moscow with economic sanctions. In response, Russia sanctioned over 300 Japanese lawmakers in July. Russia recently cut gas supplies to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to just a fifth of its capacity. Moscow has repeatedly denied it is weaponizing fossil fuel supplies over the Russia-Ukraine war. Tanaka said that Japan wants to secure energy supplies but also work toward reaching carbon neutrality by 2050, and striking that balance could prove increasingly challenging. Nuclear power has been touted as an important option for decarbonization.\n\"Japan is trying to secure the supply of energy, especially electricity, while trying to maintain the targets of carbon neutral by 2050 intact. So this is really (a) challenge for Japan to do many things,\" he said."},

In a recent note, Charles Dumas, chief economist at U.K.-based investment research firm TS Lombard, said that action on climate change is often criticized as moving too slowly. However, with governments increasing spending to aid their post-Covid economies, they may start catching up. A key tenet of this is the ever-decreasing cost of electricity per megawatt hour, according to figures from TS Lombard, with costs of solar, offshore and onshore wind dropping over the last 10 years, while gas and coal have remained largely the same. \"Effectively by 2030 the cost of renewable electricity is going to be half that of coal and gas sourced electricity,\" Dumas told CNBC. These trends will bring many of the various pledges to reach net zero more closely in sight. The fatal floods in Germany in recent weeks have put the impacts of climate change firmly in the spotlight again but they are only the latest in a series of devastating extreme weather events of late, including the sprawling wildfires in Oregon. Amid this backdrop, the United Nations Climate Change Conference, better known as COP26, will meet in Glasgow in November. It will mark one of the most significant multilateral meetings on climate since the Paris agreement. Dumas said that as COP26 approaches, governments need to understand their key priorities, and among them should be infrastructure investments as numerous technological and engineering challenges continue to obstruct renewable energy. \"I think the intermittency problem is pretty serious and it's not just that the sun goes down at night,\" Dumas said. In the case of solar power, output can be mixed depending on the location of infrastructure like solar farms. \"There's huge variation with sunny days in winter and sunny days in the middle of summer so the intermittency takes on a very big seasonal aspect,\" Dumas said. \"You can have vicious weather for a long time in the middle of December or January and lo and behold you wouldn't want to be depending on solar power.\" Energy transmission could be another bottleneck, he said. While the developing world, including several African nations, has great potential in developing sites for generating solar power, that power needs to move easily. \"The issue of transmission technology is really major. If you want Chad to be the new Saudi Arabia, because of the Sahara Desert there's a lot of sun there, but you want the electricity to be used in Europe then you're talking about some expensive processes and processes needing a lot of research and a lot of further investment.\" Storage and carbon capture are all areas that require hefty investment, Dumas added, if governments are to reach their net-zero targets. \"What we need is a very clear public policy lead in order to get anywhere near these net zero promises and I suspect that actually what it's going to be about is a carbon tax, which the Americans may resist but will be necessary,\" he said. Paul Steele, chief economist at an independent policy research institute called the International Institute for Environment and Development, said that climate action and renewable energy investments will serve the dual purpose of tackling the climate crisis while creating jobs for the post-Covid economy. \"One of the priorities coming out of Covid is to create labor intensive employment. Both in developed and developing countries, you can provide labor intensive employment through renewable energy,\" Steele said. One example, he said, was the retrofitting of boilers in homes in the U.K., which would help push the country toward its climate targets and create new jobs while being relatively inexpensive in the grand scheme of things. Steele said that investments to drive a climate-friendly economy cannot be short term or have quick goals. He pointed to the various government support schemes for the airline industry, which has been battered by the pandemic. Just this week, the European courts gave the nod to a $2.9 billion bailout for Air France-KLM's Dutch business. Bailout funds like these should be tied to sustainability commitments by the airline industry, he said, but that can be a dicey proposition to get over the line. \"Governments aren't making the connections enough and traditionally treasuries and particularly the ministries of transport are still dominated by road building lobbies and people who like to build highways and increase transport rather than people who want to invest in sustainable alternatives.\"  "},
{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/10/india-australia-singapore-firms-jobs-are-in-these-sectors-linkedin.html", "title": "Australia, India and Singapore companies are still hiring. Here's where the jobs are", "paragraphs": " Recession fears may be looming in Asia-Pacific, but that hasn't stopped companies in India, Australia and Singapore from continuing their hiring spree, according to LinkedIn. As economies reopened after the pandemic, companies in the hospitality, retail and entertainment sectors ramped up hiring, said Feon Ang, Asia-Pacific managing director at the professional networking platform. All three countries saw an increase in job postings on LinkedIn for jobs in the accommodation sector, such as hotels, motels, casino hotels and bed-and-breakfast inns. According to data collected by LinkedIn, paid job postings for careers in Australia, India and Singapore increased in June compared to a year ago, with the following sectors seeing the most growth: 1. Accommodation, up 62%\n2. Retail jobs, up 46%\n3. Financial services, up 25% 1. Accommodation, up 65%\n2. Construction, up 40%\n3. Real estate and equipment rental services, up 25% 1. Accommodation, up 15%\n2. Transport and logistics, up 31%\n3. Entertainment providers (businesses involved in performances, events, and exhibitions), up 100% However, jobs in Singapore's health care, education and construction industries were all down by more than 30%, according to LinkedIn. Ang noted that the cutback of job postings for Singapore's construction sector was likely due to measures introduced by the government to cool the private and residential property market. Although there's an increase in hiring rates across the three countries, there was less competition among job seekers in June compared to one year ago, LinkedIn data showed. On average, there was a more than a 50% drop in applications for paid job postings on LinkedIn in Australia, India and Singapore \"Even as job postings rise, workers are being more selective in picking their next role, and so competition for jobs on average is down,\" said Ang. \"This means that workers are in a position to demand more out of work, and have higher expectations of what they want in a job \u2013 and that's a healthy sign,\" she added. In both Australia and Singapore, paid job postings that offered remote work options fell. Paid listings in Australia fell by 8% in June compared to a year ago, although sentiment for flexible working arrangements was still strong. Opportunities that offered remote working options received two times more applications on average, according to LinkedIn. In Singapore, paid job postings that allowed employees to work from home fell from 8% in the first quarter to 6.7% in the second quarter. But unlike employees in Australia, LinkedIn observed that interest in flexible working arrangements seemed to be waning in Singapore. Employers in India felt differently, according to the data. Paid job postings in the South Asian country which offered remote work options remained relatively constant throughout the year and there wasn't particularly more interest in jobs with remote options. \"Postings with remote options received only 1.1x more applications on average relative to their absolute share of all job postings in both quarters,\" said LinkedIn."},

Here\u2019s what it costs \u2014 and how they pay for it", "paragraphs": " Ernestas Tyminas felt \"stuck\" in his role as a marketing manager at a newspaper in Colorado Springs, Colorado. So he requested two months off to backpack through Asia, he said, landing in Beijing in January 2019. \"On the first day \u2026 I meet this one,\" he said, gesturing to Darina Karpitskaya, sitting by his side. The couple, speaking to CNBC via video from Dubai, said they met via the travel app Couchsurfing, which links solo travelers together. Karpitskaya, 31, and a flight attendant at the time, had been grounded in Beijing for two days because of mechanical problems with her return flight. Though more solo travelers agreed to meet that day, Tyminas and Karpitskaya were the only two who showed up. After one day together, they planned to meet again in Asia one month later. Karpitskaya returned to Asia, and the couple's second date was a \"crazy one-month adventure\" to Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines, said Tyminas, 29. It was in the Philippines, he said, that he decided he wasn't going back to his old life. \"We were \u2026 laying on the beach under the stars,\" he said. \"We were kind of starting to dream about this lifestyle.\" After returning to Colorado, Tyminas quit his job, sold his belongings and moved to Europe, he said. Karpitskaya wasn't quite there yet, saying, \"At first it sounded like: Oh my God, you're quitting your job. You're moving from America. Maybe it's too soon. But at the same time, when I came back from that trip I felt like I'm living a life that I'm not enjoying.\" Tyminas flew from Denver to Paris with his dog \u2014 an 82-pound Borzoi, once known as the \"Russian Wolfhound,\" named Cosmo, who is over 6 feet tall on his hind legs. \"They gave me three rows of seats, and the dog was just laying on the floor,\" he said. From there, the couple traveled often \u2014 to places like Italy and Iceland \u2014 but not yet full time, they said. Then Karpitskaya got what she called her \"dream job\" \u2014 a position with Emirates airline. She moved to Dubai, but the couple continued to meet and travel together. Then Covid hit, and Karpitskaya accepted four months of unpaid leave from her job. \"We said: We have four months \u2014 we can go explore whatever is open,\" said Tyminas. The trio \u2014 including Cosmo, who traveled in a huge bed in the back of their SUV \u2014 traveled first to Croatia, then slowly across much of Europe, including many former Soviet states, said Karpitskaya. She never returned to her job, and couple have been traveling ever since, she said. In the beginning, they spent between $1,000 and $2,000 a month \u2014 all from savings \u2014 by staying in cheap accommodations, cooking at home and seeking out free activities, said Tyminas. As money started to dry up, Tyminas took several online jobs, which netted between $2,000 and $3,000 a month, which wasn't far from his salary of $3,300 in Colorado, he said. But the work was cumbersome, and it \"felt like I still had a job,\" he said. So the couple decided to open a marketing and graphic design company, despite the fact that \"we didn't know a lot,\" said Tyminas. They reached out to thousands of people, they said, often working late into the night. Potential customers would ask, \"Can you design book covers?\" \"Can you promote music?\" Tyminas said his response was always the same, \"Of course I can.\" In reality, he was learning on the job, he said, relying on YouTube, Google and online research. But clients were very happy, he said. \"They paid me half of what they would pay other marketing agencies and the results, they said, were better than they had before,\" said Tyminas. In the first month, the couple made $6,000, he said. Now, sometimes they earn several thousand dollars in a day working with real estate companies and music labels, he added. \"We write blogs for people \u2014 we do everything,\" said Tyminas. Plus \"we don't have to report to anybody. We're our own bosses.\" In the past six months, the couple said they spent an average of $4,000 a month. More than half goes to accommodations, which vary by location \u2014 from $3,100 per month in Dubai to $1,500 in Lisbon, Portugal, they said. They limit stays in expensive locations, like Switzerland, to no more than a week, they said. One way to save money is booking monthlong stays on Airbnb, which cuts down average nightly rates and reduces service and cleaning fees, said Tyminas. But even when they bounced from place to place to visit Europe's Christmas markets last year, they still ended up paying about $2,500 that month, he said. Karpitskaya said she doesn't want these costs to scare people because they spent far less in the beginning. At the time, they spent about 80-100% of their income, but now Tyminas said \"we spend about 30% and \u2026 save the rest.\" The couple told CNBC they still travel modestly \u2014 no five-star hotels \u2014 and they still cook most meals at home. But they spend more on activities that they film for their YouTube channel Dream Team Travels \u2014 another \"completely self-taught\" venture, they said. A life of constant travel isn't all fun and games, they said. They encounter dirty Airbnbs and hosts who cancel reservations at the last minute. They've also had their camera equipment and clothing stolen twice \u2014 once in Mexico, and more recently in France \u2014 plus an attempted theft of their belongings from their car in Barcelona, while they were sitting in it. They have also thought about settling down when they find a place they really love, such as the beaches of Portugal or the French Riviera, said Tyminas. \"But then \u2026 we drive somewhere else and we're like this place is also just as good,\" he said. When Russia invaded Ukraine, quickly occupying the Kherson region where Karpitskaya's parents live, Tyminas emailed CNBC to say that they'd stopped traveling for the time being. \"The first few weeks we didn't even leave our apartment,\" he said. \"We spent a lot of time arranging transportation for civilians as well as many dogs from shelters to be taken out of dangerous regions for adoption in Europe.\" By the summer, they had resumed traveling, but were still helping to evacuate Karpitskaya's family. \"Just a week ago we were able to finally get Darina's parents out of Ukraine,\" said Tyminas, adding that they are currently in his family's home in Lithuania. \"We also did a trip to Romania to pick up Darina's sister and her five-month-old baby from the border and took her to live in Germany.\" The couple are now in Malaysia, they said, and plan to explore Southeast Asia for the next two months."},

The world's biggest long-haul carrier will be retrofitting over 120 aircraft with new interiors, as well as dishing up menus with new vegan options and cinema snacks like popcorn, Emirates said in a statement.\nOther new perks for the carrier's first-class travelers include unlimited portions of Persian caviar, paired with Dom Perignon vintage champagne. Those investments come just as Emirates posted a $1.1 billion loss for the year ended March 31. \"While others respond to industry pressures with cost cuts, Emirates is flying against the grain and investing to deliver ever better experiences to our customers,\" said the president of Emirates airline, Tim Clark. Emirates is not the only airline pulling out all the stops to ride the tailwinds of \"revenge travel\" \u2014 the idea that people are making up for time \"lost\" during the pandemic to travel again. Earlier this year, Finnair launched a new line of premium economy cabins, featuring seats that provide around 50% more space than their economy seats. Air France, likewise, announced new long-haul business seats in May, complete with sliding dividers for passengers who want their own private space.\nEmirates told CNBC that it has seen \"a lot of interest\" in these luxury upgrades, though it said it does not have the full numbers yet. The upgrades come on the heels of an industry report predicting that business travel spending will return to pre-pandemic levels in 2026 rather than 2024, as previously forecast. Though spending by business travelers has been on the upswing, the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) annual report stated that the 2021 figure was still less than half of the over $1.4 trillion that was generated by in business travel in 2019. One travel analytics company, however, noted a shift in demand toward premium seats. \"During the pandemic, we saw that the numbers of people travelling by air collapsed. However, the proportion of travelers flying in premium cabins increased significantly,\" Olivier Ponti of ForwardKeys told CNBC in an email.\nPonti said that before the pandemic, the split between premium and economy seats was a ratio of 13:87, compared with 17:83 in 2022.\n\"While there's no guarantee that the shift towards premium seats will be maintained as air travel recovers, one can understand why the airlines would want to invest in keeping hold of premium passengers, who, this year have typically spent 575% more on a seat than those flying economy.\" Others are skeptical, however. Edward Russell, an editor at Skift, a travel industry news site, told CNBC it's unclear how much of an effect \"small\" product changes will have on sales. \"Most travelers either fly the airline, or alliance, where they have loyalty, or opt for the cheapest fare. It is only a small subset of travelers who will actually book a flight based on the addition of a sliding door or unlimited caviar.\""},

A new study compared prices to find out", "paragraphs": " Many travelers try to save money by searching the internet for cheaper hotel rates. But a new study suggests it may not be worth the time \u2014 at least in some places. The travel insurance comparison site InsureMyTrip compared rates for 950 hotels in 19 global cities on three popular booking websites as well as each hotel's site. According to the results published last week, Hotels.com had the best overall rates \u2014 but just barely. Hotels.com had the best rates in 620 instances, which was slightly higher than Expedia, which had the cheapest rates in 579 instances. Booking directly with a hotel was more expensive, but by only about $6 more on average, according to the study. \"There have been conflicting views on hotel rates, and people ... believe that booking through online travel platforms ensured a better rate than the hotel website,\" said Shalabh Arora, director of marketing at India's Four Seasons Hotel Bengaluru. \"However, it's not so at Four Seasons where rate parity is taken very seriously.\" He said the hotels' website has a pop-up function which compares rates offered by the hotel with those on other booking platforms. Finally, the website Booking.com had the cheapest rates in 72 instances \u2014 or about 7% of the time \u2014 according to the study. \"Not only was [Booking.com] rarely the most affordable, but it was also the most expensive option the majority of the time,\" according to the published results. The company's Managing Director for Asia Pacific Laura Houldsworth responded to the study by email, stating that the company aims \"to always be transparent with our customers\" and that \"our property partners are free to set their own prices on Booking.com.\" She added that \"our promise to price match also means that if a customer should ever find a lower price on another website, Booking.com will refund the difference.\" The report found average hotel rates on Hotels.com and Expedia were the same in seven of 19 cities, with overall averages varying by just 27 cents. \"Expedia and Hotels.com often had the same price, especially with the international hotels,\" said Sarah Webber, director of marketing for InsureMyTrip. Both brands are owned by Expedia Group, which also operates other travel booking websites, including Travelocity, Hotwire, Orbitz and CheapTickets. \"Hotels working with Expedia Group distribute their rates across all of our brands,\" said Anna Brown, a company public relations manager. \"The rate is similar across brands, however various offers ... approved by our hotel partners, sometimes create rate differences.\" Brown said rates can also vary through brands' app-only pricing, while Hotwire's \"Hot Rates\" mask hotels' names prior to purchase in exchange for deep discounts on last-minute bookings. Booking.com is part of Booking Holdings, which operates Priceline, Agoda and Kayak. Booking Holdings had the highest revenue among all online travel agencies from 2019 to 2021, according to the research company Statista. The InsureMyTrip report showed significant rate differences in certain cities. For instance, travelers could save as much as $88 per night in Honolulu, if they found the lowest price. In New York, the report found average hotel rates varied from $293 on Hotels.com to $367 on Booking.com. The study also found: But rate fluctuations were less pronounced outside of the United States. Posted rates varied less than $10 per night on average in Hong Kong, Bangkok, Macau, Kuala Lumpur and Istanbul, according to the research. InsureMyTrip's study represents a snapshot in time, with the research analyzing rates for a double room for two people booked for the night of Aug. 27, 2022, the firm said. All searches were conducted on the same day to avoid price fluctuations, since \"prices can change quickly and without warning,\" said Webber. However, the study did not consider whether rates were refundable or included taxes, said Webber. \"To keep the study as simple as possible, we took the price seen on the sites as the final cost,\" she said. \"So, it's definitely something to consider as not all hotels or booking sites include the same extras in the final price.\" Other factors, such as prepayment requirements and breakfast inclusions, can affect rates too, which further complicates the hotel price comparison process \u2014 for researchers and travelers alike."},

Here are their stories. Job: Emmy-award winning TV host of \" Samantha Brown's Places to Love\"\nStarted in: Comedy \" I went to Syracuse University for musical theater because I so desperately wanted to move to New York City and become a thespian. I wanted to do Shakespeare and be on Broadway. That didn't pan out. I waited on tables for a good eight years. But I loved improv, and I was a part of an improv comedy troupe. So I just kept auditioning for jobs. A writer recommended me to a production company that was \u2026 looking for a host. But my audition for it had to be totally improvised. That's how I got the job. When you are a travel host, there's no script. Yet it is still up to you to define the scene, to understand the trajectory of a story and how to end it. Also in improv, the golden rule is to never say no, it's always yes \u2014 to keep things going. Waiting on tables in New York City for eight years, you start to be really humbled, [but] those were the tools that I had that got me a job that I never in my wildest dreams thought I would ever have.\" Job: Creator of \" Strictly Dumpling\" and other YouTube channels (total: about 8 million subscribers)\nStarted in: Accounting and wedding videography \"I moved to the U.S. from China when I was 8 years old. My parents started working in restaurants, and eventually started their own very Americanized Chinese restaurant. So I grew up on a steady diet of General Tso's chicken and crab rangoon. There wasn't a lot of diversity where I'm from, but it helped that my parents sent me back to China when I was 13. Most people get grounded and sent to their room as a punishment \u2014 I got sent to China for two years. That's when I was like: Wow, it's so amazing \u2014 the people, the history \u2014 I want to know more. After college, I went to New York and worked on Wall Street for a year. Then I became a wedding videographer because I wanted to be flexible. I was living in a small basement apartment in Brooklyn with no air conditioning, making about $400 \u2014 on a good week. But this was the first time I was eating something that wasn't Red Lobster and Olive Garden. I got a taste of diverse ethnic food in Chinatown, and I started to discover a lot of my heritage that I never really saw as important before. I started recording food videos on YouTube as a food diary for myself. I remember having a conversation with a friend that food content will never amount to anything. There wasn't anybody online doing it. I had like 10 subscribers. Somehow it grew to this, which was never expected. I never really had much money growing up \u2014 or throughout most of my adulthood. So I was always looking for things that were inexpensive but also really filling and delicious. And that's pretty much what I do around the world now.\" Job: Television host of \" Family Travel with Colleen Kelly\"\nStarted in: Sales \"I tried out for the broadcast school at the University of Texas. The school gave you one chance to be accepted into the program. I had never sat at an anchor desk with a camera pointed at me. I failed miserably. Several years later, I graduated and got my first job in sales, eventually moving to Chicago and working in the pharmaceutical industry. The money was amazing, and I had a company car. But I wasn't living my dream, and this started to really bother me. In my early 30s, I got married and eventually quit my job to be a stay-at-home mom. One day, when my two little girls were in school, I went to our town hall's cable TV station and asked if, in exchange for teaching me how to edit, I could host the local entertainment show about our village \u2014 something like \"Access Hollywood\" for our 50,000-resident town. Because they had no other offers, they said yes. I acted confident, but I was as green as they come. I was shaking in my boots every time I did an interview and read voice-over, but I was gaining experience and knowledge. I confided in another mom that my dream was to host a national travel show, and, surprisingly, she agreed to produce it with me. We wrote a script, found a local camera guy for a few dollars and made a pilot. I took meetings with two major companies \u2014 both said no. I was told by one network that women don't watch travel shows, so the concept of family travel didn't appeal to them. I then sent thousands of emails to television stations. Nothing worked. Finally, my mother suggested I call the local PBS station. I googled the head of programming, called him (no emails) and got a meeting. After more meetings, we learned PBS was picking two shows to go national, and \"Family Travel with Colleen Kelly\" was one of them. We scraped by for a year, producing 13 episodes that first season. Now, the show has been on for more than 10 years. And, the best part is that I can bring my family with me. It's been a long and arduous journey, but I hope this story inspires others to believe in themselves, ignore the naysayers, and never give up on their dream.\" Editor's note: These interviews have been edited for length and clarity."},

The decision contradicts a 2019 ruling over dress code policies at Walmart that allowed the retail titan to limit (but not ban) employees from wearing pro-union insignia at work. Two members of the labor board dissented on the Tesla ruling, while three moved to overrule the prior Walmart decision. The majority wrote, \"when an employer interferes in any way with its employees' right to display union insignia, the employer must prove special circumstances that justify its interference.\" Tesla did not demonstrate special circumstances that justified its policy, the NLRB decided. Tesla had previously argued before the NLRB that its dress code was meant to prevent workers' clothing from \"causing mutilations\" to the cars or car seats they were building, and to help managers \"easily determine that employees are in their assigned work areas,\" of the company's factory. Former Tesla employees had testified before the NLRB that management at Tesla made them remove T-shirts with United Auto Workers union messages and logos on them, even though they posed no risk of damaging cars or car seats. The UAW and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday. Previously, the NLRB ruled that Tesla CEO Elon Musk violated labor laws when he suggested in a tweet that Tesla workers would need to give up their stock options if they unionized.

The local government approvals allow Baidu's Apollo Go robotaxi business to eliminate the cost of human personnel in some instances. The initial scale of the permits is small: 10 robotaxis divided between two suburban areas of Wuhan and Chongqing, two major Chinese cities. In April, Baidu and rival robotaxi operator Pony.ai received approval from a Beijing suburban district to operate robotaxis without a human driver. But the Chinese capital still requires human staff to sit in the robotaxi with passengers. Municipal authorities across China have issued an increasing number of permits in the last year that allow robotaxi companies to operate and charge fares in selected areas. In the U.S., Alphabet's Waymo and General Motors ' subsidiary Cruise can already run public robotaxis with no human staff in the vehicles. Laws for testing robotaxis and charging riders vary by city and state. Baidu claimed it has received more than one million orders for robotaxi rides. In the first three months of the year, the company said it operated 196,000 rides. Baidu is set to release second quarter results on Aug. 30."},

Google said the app lacks effective systems for moderating user-generated content, which violates the store's terms of service. \"On Aug. 19, we notified Truth Social of several violations of standard policies in their current app submission and reiterated that having effective systems for moderating user-generated content is a condition of our terms of service for any app to go live on Google Play,\" the tech company, which is owned by Alphabet, told CNBC in a statement Tuesday. Axios first reported the Google statement. The restriction means that Android users, who make up 44% of smartphone users in the U.S., can't download the app. Google will not let the app go live until the content issues are addressed. Truth Social acknowledged Google's concerns and said it would work on addressing these issues, according to Axios. Trump Media and Technology Group CEO Devin Nunes told a different story. The former lawmaker, who was one of former President Donald Trump's staunchest allies in Congress, said the decision is up to Google and not dependent on Truth Social's policies. \"When are we going to be available on Android? Well, look, that's up to the Google Play store. We're waiting on them to approve us, I don't know what's taking so long,\" Nunes said on the \"Just the News Not Noise\" podcast. \"It sure would be nice if they would approve us.\" Google said that Nunes' statements misrepresent the ongoing dialogue between Trump Media and the Play store. Google reiterated that Truth Social's violations, and the steps to redress them, have been clearly communicated with the company. Trump Media pushed back, saying Truth Social was creating a \"vibrant, family-friendly environment.\" \"TMTG has no desire to litigate its business matters in the public sphere, but for the record, has promptly responded to all inquiries from Google,\" the company said in a press release Tuesday. \"It is our belief that all Americans should have access to Truth Social no matter what devices they use. We look forward to Google approving Truth Social at their earliest convenience.\" Trump Media and Technology Group made the app available for preorder on Android in early August. It is available on Apple's App Store. Google's YouTube has suspended Trump's channel. Android users can still access Truth Social through the platform's website. The restriction is one of several obstacles faced by the former president's app. Truth Social was created as a \"free-speech\" alternative to Twitter, after Trump was banned from the platform for his tweets relating to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Hundreds of the president's supporters stormed the building that day to try to block Congress from confirming Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election. Trump, who had about 88 million followers on Twitter, has about 4 million followers on Truth Social, where he continues to push false claims about the election. He is facing a criminal investigation over secret government records he took with him to his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida and is considering another run for the White House. Trump Media was set to go public through a merger with Digital World Acquisition Corporation, a special-purpose acquisition company. The deadline is Sept. 8, although DWAC is pushing for a delay of up to a year. DWAC warned shareholders that a decline in the former president's popularity could hurt the app and that, without a delay, the acquisition company may have to liquidate. DWAC scheduled a shareholder meeting for Sept. 6, two days before the current merger deadline. Shares of the company were down more than 2% Tuesday at $24.65, far from their peak of about $97 in March."},

The Japanese gaming giant launched PlayStation Studios Mobile Division on Monday and said it will run independently of the console business. Sony also said on Monday it acquired Helsinki- and Berlin-based mobile game developer Savage Game Studios. The move comes after a tough second quarter for Sony's gaming division, and the company's downgrading of its full-year profit forecast for the business as the Covid-induced boom \u2014 during which people were stuck at home playing video games \u2014 begins to fade. Sony also continues to face supply chain issues and cannot meet the demand for its flagship PlayStation 5 console. Sony has dominated the console market for several years, thanks to the PlayStation. But the company is now looking to diversify. This year, the Japanese gaming giant said it plans to release around 50% of games on PC and mobile by 2025, up from about a quarter currently. \"For that to happen, Sony needs to make big bets on mobile gaming,\" Serkan Toto, CEO of Tokyo-based game industry consultancy Kantan Games, told CNBC. And the opportunity is big. Consoles account for about 27% of the $196.8 billion games market, whereas mobile makes up more than half of revenues, according to Newzoo. The purchase of Savage Game Studios continues Sony's recent acquisition drive as it looks to boost the development of titles across platforms. \"PlayStation Studios must continue to expand and diversify our offering beyond console, bringing incredible new games to more people than ever before,\" said Hermen Hulst, head of PlayStation studios. \"Acquiring the talented team at Savage Game Studios is another strategic step towards that goal.\" Sony said that Savage Game Studios is working on an \"unannounced new AAA mobile live service action game.\" A \"triple A\" game is an informal industry classification usually for a blockbuster type of title. A live service game is usually a title where developers continually update and add content to extend its lifetime and generate revenue over a longer period of time. The success of Call of Duty Mobile and Diablo Immortal on mobile, both of which were originally designed for console and PC, show there is demand for well-known titles on smaller screens \"if executed well,\" according to Daniel Ahmad, senior analyst at Niko Partners. Sony's mobile strategy is likely to lean on its massive library of intellectual property (IP) but also with a focus on developing specific games for smaller devices, Kantan Games' Toto said. \"Sony is very likely to not only bring existing PlayStation IPs to mobile but also encourage studios to develop new franchises for smart devices from scratch,\" Toto said. Sony is the latest console maker to make a big step into mobile gaming. Microsoft's Xbox gaming unit has also begun making early moves into mobile. Nintendo has, for the last three years, also been focusing a lot of effort on the smaller screen gaming format. Globally, Sony will compete with companies it hadn't really before, particularly Chinese giants Tencent and NetEase \u2014 two of the world's largest mobile gaming players. But Toto said Sony's chances of success are still high. \"The mobile gaming market is overcrowded. There are over 1 million games in app stores nowadays. But players such as Sony, even if they are new entrants, can still make it just because of their fire power,\" Toto told CNBC. \"There are not many companies like Sony out there, with such strong branding, a whole range of high-performing studios and a treasure trove of valuable IPs.\""},
{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/29/apple-iphone-14-event-preview-september-2022.html", "title": "Expect Apple to show four new iPhones and an updated Apple Watch next week", "paragraphs": " Apple is holding a launch event at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, on Sept. 7. The company is expected to announce new iPhone models, as it has every September since 2012. Apple has used prerecorded videos for its launch events since early 2020 thanks partly to Covid restrictions, and this will be the first iPhone launch with an in-person component since 2019. Apple is streaming the launch event online on its website and YouTube in addition to inviting some media to its campus. Apple's hype-filled fall launches are a signature event for Apple. They typically draw millions of simultaneous viewers on YouTube. They garner attention from around the world and set the stage for a holiday marketing blitz during the last three months of the year, which is when Apple's sales are the highest. This year's event has the tagline \"far out,\" which could refer to features such as night-sky photography. Last year, Apple released new iPhones and Apple Watches at an event in September, and then followed it up with an October launch featuring iPads and Macs. Here's what Apple is likely to launch next Wednesday, based on reports. Apple is expected to release four new iPhone models. If Apple's current naming convention holds up, they will be called the iPhone 14. This year Apple will likely discontinue the \"mini\" model with a 4.7-inch screen, according to reports. Instead, Apple could offer two sizes, one with a 6.1-inch screen and one with a 6.7-inch screen, each coming in a standard model and a pricier \"Pro\" model. The Pro models are expected to get more upgrades, according to reports from Bloomberg News, TFI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, and other analysts and Apple watchers. Since 2017, iPhones have included a space at the top of the phone's display with space for Apple's FaceID system, which includes several sensors and a camera. The Pro models could ditch Apple's \"notch\" where it houses the FaceID camera for a slimmer, more streamlined \"pill\" or \"cutout\" approach with a smaller space that has to remain blank, leaving room for an even larger display. The Pro models are also expected to get upgraded A16 processors and cameras. The camera bump is expected to get larger. Apple could release an always-on screen display for showing notifications, like some Android phones have sported for years. Beta iPhone software released over the summer suggested that Apple may be planning a similar feature because of new widgets that show weather and battery life. One of the biggest questions is how Apple will price its iPhones in a period of inflation around the world and macroeconomic uncertainty in some regions. Other consumer electronics, such as Sony's Playstation 5, have seen price cuts. Apple's least-expensive iPhone 13 model is the $699 iPhone 13 Mini, which is expected to be discontinued. That would make Apple's mainline device, which is currently the iPhone 13, the least-expensive new model at $829, if its price doesn't change. Some analysts also expect Apple to increase the price of its Pro models. Apple usually drops the price of older models when it releases new ones, giving more price-sensitive consumers an option. Apple is likely to show the eighth major new version of its watch next week. Last year, the Apple Watch Series 7 got a slightly larger screen, but the redesign did not significantly change the look and feel of the device, which has remained mostly the same since 2014. Expect more evolution this year, too. Apple is considering a body temperature sensor in the new devices, according to the Wall Street Journal, which could help with fertility and sleep tracking. Other sleep tracking features could include the ability to detect advanced sleep patterns or apnea. But the biggest Apple Watch Series 8 announcement could be a new \"Pro\" model with a bigger screen and more durable finish. Apple has previously released Apple Watches with pricey case materials such as gold, ceramic and titanium, and the new \"Pro\" model described by Bloomberg and Kuo could be one of the first high-end Apple Watches to gain additional features over its less-expensive siblings. Also likely: A new updated version of the Apple Watch SE, its $329 entry-level Watch model. IPhone owners who don't plan to buy any new gear this fall will still get an annual update to the iPhones software, iOS 16, which was announced in June and has been in testing over the summer. The software has several new features that users will immediately notice. The biggest banner feature is the ability to customize the iPhone's lock screen with widgets that can display weather forecasts, calendar appointments and other information at a glance. Users can also change the font for the lock screen clock for the first time, as well. IOS 16 also lets you unsend or edit iMessage text messages, as long as you catch them within a few minutes of sending. IOS 16 will also introduce short-term loans from Apple called Apple Pay Later. The feature will allow users to buy stuff online with Apple Pay but pay for the item in four installments without paying interest. One cool feature in iOS 16 is if a user has both an iPhone and a Mac laptop or desktop, they can use the iPhone as a very high-definition web camera. Apple is unlikely to release new iPads next week because their software isn't ready yet. Earlier this month, Apple told TechCrunch that iPadOS, the iPad software, will ship after iOS this fall, suggesting a staggered release. Apple's statement was terse, and the company dislikes talking about unannounced products. But in general, it likes to release new hardware together with new software, so the statement clearly suggested that new iPads would come at a later launch date than iPhones. IPadOS and iOS are very similar, but this year iPadOS is getting a feature called Stage Manager that could allow users to multitask more efficiently \u2014 but also got panned by early testers. Improved iPads could include more powerful processors that are closers to laptop processors, smoother displays and better integration with accessories. Apple also uncharacteristically teased a new \"Mac Pro\" in the spring. The Mac Pro is currently a $5,000 tower of power using an Intel processor. Apple wants to transition its entire Mac lineup away from Intel to its own M-series processors, but a pricey niche product doesn't fit as well with Apple's mass-market iPhones and Apple Watches. Instead, new Macs could be announced at a separate event later this year, as happened last year."},

The company will invest up to $1 billion in the new factory, which it plans to build in the Southeast of the U.S. The newly announced plant will be the panel maker's fourth fully integrated U.S. factory. First Solar also said Tuesday that it will spend $185 million upgrading and expanding its existing facilities in Ohio. CEO Mark Widmar pointed to the IRA as the key catalyst that made the company decide to build another factory in the U.S. rather than looking elsewhere. The funding packages create, for the first time, a \"long-term view and understanding of the industry, and policies aligned to that industry,\" he told CNBC. \"With that level of clarity, we stepped back and evaluated the alternatives or the options of where we could go with our next factory and when we looked at it comprehensively the U.S. was a very attractive option,\" he said. Widmar added that this is the first time the entire supply chain has been incentivized, from the manufacturer to the generating asset and finally to the end customer. \"With that type of alignment, you can create partnerships and opportunities to grow together collectively and more of a win-win type of structure than maybe we had before the implementation of the IRA,\" he said. First Solar said the new factory will manufacture 3.5 gigawatts of solar modules annually by 2025, with the company's Ohio facilities posting cumulative annual production capacity of over 7 GW by 2025. By comparison, the U.S. added 3.9 GW of solar capacity during the first quarter of 2022, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. The country's total solar industry now stands at 126.1 GW, which is enough to power 22 million homes, according to SEIA. Shares of First Solar have surged 65% since the end of July when Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V. announced their surprise agreement on the climate, health care and tax bill. The legislation, which swiftly passed the House and Senate and was signed into law by President Joe Biden, benefits First Solar in several ways, including through the production tax credit for domestic manufacturers. First Solar is the largest U.S.-based developer of solar panels, with a focus on utility-scale panels. The factory announcement comes as First Solar struggles to keep pace with booming demand. During its second quarter earnings call, First Solar said it's sold out through 2025, with a backlog of 44 GW. Widmar said First Solar wants to move quickly when building out its new factory. One of the company's considerations is a site that's as close to shovel-ready as possible. Other factors include the type and availability of workers in the area. First Solar is aiming to have identified the site by the end of the current quarter. \"I think the industry is in the best position it ever has been\u2026for growth beyond any expectations that anyone would have envisioned,\" Widmar said."},

The decision will affect flights by Xiamen, Air China, China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines from Sept. 5 to Sept. 28. The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) cited the recent cancellation of 26 American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines flights over Covid-19 cases. The suspensions include 19 China-bound flights from Los Angeles and 7 China Eastern flights from New York. The Chinese Embassy in Washington's spokesperson Liu Pengyu said the USDOT action was \"extremely irresponsible\" and \"groundlessly suspended Chinese airline flights.\" The embassy said China's Covid-19 \"circuit breaker\" measures were fair and transparent, applied both to Chinese and foreign airlines and were consistent with bilateral air transportation agreements. USDOT said as of Aug. 7 Chinese authorities had revised their policies so if the number of passengers on a flight to China testing positive for Covid-19 reached 4% of the total, one flight would be suspended. If it reached 8%, two flights would be suspended. USDOT said the U.S. has repeatedly raised objections with China, saying the rules place \"undue culpability on carriers\" when travelers test negative before boarding their flight from the United States only to \"test positive for Covid-19 after their arrival in China.\" Beijing and Washington have sparred over air services since the start of the pandemic. In January, the Transportation Department suspended 44 China-bound flights from the United States by the four Chinese carriers in response to China's decision suspend 44 flights by U.S. carriers. In August 2021, USDOT limited four flights from Chinese carriers to 40% passenger capacity for four weeks after Beijing imposed identical limits on four United Airlines flights. Three U.S. airlines and four Chinese carriers typically operate about 20 flights a week between the countries, well below the figure of more than 100 a week before the pandemic."},

In its Q2 investor letter on July 21, Snap said it would not provide guidance for its current quarter and said \"forward-looking visibility remains incredibly challenging.\" Snap shares dropped more than 25% on the day it reported its second quarter earnings. The company's disappointing results kickstarted a wave of social media companies reporting poor results, citing a weak online advertising market, among other reasons. Facebook-parent Meta also missed analysts' estimates for its second quarter, as did Pinterest. The social media companies blamed some of their problems on businesses cutting back on digital advertising because of the weak economy. Additionally, these companies have said that a 2021 privacy update to Apple's iOS has made it more difficult for them to track users, thus negatively impacting their online ad units.

Mark Kelly in November's election, according to people familiar with the matter. Masters has received urgent private calls in recent weeks from GOP leaders like Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, these people explained. The NRSC is the official campaign arm for the Senate GOP, and has spent over $6 million taking on Masters' rival Kelly, according to data from the nonpartisan OpenSecrets. Kelly's seat has long been considered a potential pickup opportunity for Republicans, as forecaster Cook Political Report labels the race a toss-up. Recent polling, however, suggests that Masters is falling behind. A Fox News poll taken in August shows Kelly leading Masters by 8 points, while an Arizona Republican pollster told NBC News that his own surveys showed Masters trailing Kelly by 10 points. Longtime GOP megadonors, who want to help Masters overtake Kelly but have not heard from him since he won the party's primary, have inundated the Republican candidate with calls, these people explained. A person familiar with one of the recent calls to Masters said a veteran GOP financier \"read him the riot act\" and told him, in part, that he must start raising money from more wealthy Republican donors and stop relying on billionaire tech executive Peter Thiel, his longtime colleague and friend, to help him like he did in the primary. These people declined to be named in order to speak freely about private conversations. Shortly after publication of this story, Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for the Masters campaign, denied that the candidate ever heard from a GOP megadonor who \"read him the riot act.\" Miller told CNBC in an email: \"It didn't happen.\" Kelly has massively outraised Masters, who won a Republican primary in Arizona this month. The incumbent's campaign has amassed more than $54 million during the 2022 election cycle, compared with just over $4 million for Masters' campaign, according to the latest Federal Election Commission data. Thiel contributed $15 million during the primary to a pro-Masters super PAC, Saving Arizona, and he donated $1.5 million to the committee as recently as July. Masters was the chief operating officer at Thiel Capital, an investment firm founded by Thiel. The calls to Masters come as even some Republican leaders seem to be questioning their Senate candidates. When asked about his predictions for the midterms, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said\"candidate quality\" has a lot to do with winning Senate elections. He added that he believes there will be an \"extremely close Senate\" after November's elections. The Senate is currently split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans. In a statement to CNBC, NRSC spokesman Chris Hartline did not deny that Scott called Masters to urge him to improve his fundraising operation. \"Mark Kelly votes with Joe Biden almost 100% of the time. While he claims to be a moderate, he's supported reckless Washington spending and done nothing to address the border crisis that's raging in Arizona. The NRSC will continue to remind Arizona voters of Mark Kelly's radical agenda and Blake Masters' plans to fight for Arizona families,\" Hartline said in response to questions about Scott's contact with Masters. Data from ad tracker AdImpact shows that the NRSC has booked just over $3.8 million in ads in Arizona for September, but nothing yet for October or November. The ad tracker also shows that Masters' campaign has not yet booked airtime for the fall while Kelly's team has reserved over $10 million in ad space from September through November. AdImpact says it has not yet seen data showing the Thiel-backed Saving Arizona reserve airtime for the fall. The last spending it saw from the super PAC was on Aug. 2, the day of the Arizona Senate Republican primary. The super PAC spent over $10 million during the primary, including almost $8.5 million backing Masters, according to OpenSecrets. Masters and his campaign did not return requests for comment. A spokesman for Saving Arizona did not return requests for comment. Thiel and his spokesman did not return requests for comment, including about whether the billionaire GOP donor plans to help Masters further. The candidates and outside groups from both sides of the aisle have combined to spend over $90 million in the general election Senate race in Arizona. Yet Democratic organizations appear to be outspending their Republican rivals in the Grand Canyon State on ads in the coming months. AdImpact's data shows Democratic outside groups are reserving nearly $28 million worth of ad time in Arizona over the next three months. Republican committees have so far spent just over $16 million on ad buys within the same time span trying to help Masters overtake Kelly, according to the data."},

The 15 boxes included 184 specific documents marked classified, 67 of which were marked \"confidential,\" 92 marked \"secret\" and 25 documents marked \"top secret,\" according to the affidavit. \"Based upon this investigation, I do not believe that any spaces within the PREMISES have been authorized for the storage of classified information at least since the end of FPOTUS 's Presidential Administration on January 20, 2021,\" the agent wrote in the affidavit. Of the 32 pages of the affidavit, 21 pages are almost totally or significantly blacked out. The search warrant itself was revealed voluntarily by the DOJ less than a week after the Aug. 8 raid. The warrant indicated that FBI agents were looking for materials showing violations of laws against obstruction of justice and the removal of official records, as well as the U.S. Espionage Act. The FBI took at least 20 boxes of items in the August raid, including numerous sets of highly classified documents, according to a property receipt that was also made public by the DOJ. In a social media post after the redacted affidavit was released, Trump accused the FBI and DOJ of \"public relations subterfuge\" by the fact that the word \"Nuclear\" did not appear in the document \u2014 though he also noted that it was \"heavily redacted!!!\" The affidavit did not detail the specific content of documents it expected to find. Trump also lashed out at Reinhart, arguing that he should have recused himself from this matter because he had previously removed himself from another case involving the former president. The reason for that recusal was not clear, news outlets reported, but Trump claimed it was \"based on his animosity and hatred of your favorite President, me.\" The government argued last week against releasing the affidavit, even in a redacted form. \"The redactions necessary to mitigate harms to the integrity of the investigation would be so extensive as to render the remaining unsealed text devoid of meaningful content,\" read a court filing from Jay Bratt, head of the counterintelligence and export control section of the DOJ's National Security Division. Bratt also argued that the affidavit \"would serve as a roadmap to the government's ongoing investigation\" if disclosed. Reinhart disagreed, and ordered the government to propose redactions to U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach, Florida, by Thursday. The judge accepted the DOJ's redactions later that day. The government said last week that the Mar-a-Lago raid is part of a probe that \"implicates national security\" and is still in its \"early stages.\" Trump, who first revealed the FBI's search of his Florida residence, has cast himself as the victim of a political attack by the Biden administration that was carried out against the presumptive Republican front-runner in the 2024 presidential race. The former president on Monday sued the government, asking a federal judge to block the DOJ from poring over the documents seized from Mar-a-Lago until a court-appointed third party reviews them. \"The political Hacks and Thugs had no right under the Presidential Records Act to storm Mar-a-Lago and steal everything in sight, including Passports and privileged documents,\" Trump said in a social media post earlier Friday morning.

A few states quickly followed through. Idaho sold $300,000 of bonds in a Russian oil company in early March. A day before the invasion, the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System sold its shares in the Russian bank Sberbank. But those examples are outliers. Six months into a war that has killed thousands of Ukrainians and displaced over 12 million more, most of the pledges to drop Russian investments \u2014 some made with great fanfare during news conferences \u2014 have gone unfulfilled, according to an Associated Press review, state retirement administrators and firms that invest state funds. Swift global reaction has cut off much of Russia's economy from the rest of the world. That has made it nearly impossible for divestment by state pension funds, university endowments and other public-sector holdings \u2014 as well as private investments such as those in 401(k) accounts. \"These pension funds want to get out, but it's just not realistic to sell everything in the current environment,\" said Keith Brainard, research director at the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. Benjamin Smith, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island treasury, said the factors that make it hard to divest also show that a worldwide effort to isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin is working. \"This is good news because it means that pressure from investors across the world, including Rhode Island, is succeeding in exacting a toll on the Russian economy, making it more difficult for Putin to fund his military operation, state-owned companies, and corrupt network of oligarchs,\" he said in an email, noting that Rhode Island's pension plan exposure in Russia never exceeded 0.3% of its assets. Any pre-war investments in Russia are now worthless, or nearly so. That's raising questions from some officials and fund managers about whether divesting is even necessary. In Hawaii, one of a handful of states where top administration officials did not pledge to divest, Gov. David Ige said at a May 5 news conference that the state's employee pension system had \"very little to almost nothing\" invested in Russia. \"The few remaining investments are quite small, and so I didn't feel compelled to just make a statement for political reasons that we would be divesting,\" he said. Before Russia's invasion in late February, many government-controlled investments had only small holdings \u2014 a fraction of 1% in every reported case \u2014 in Russian investments. But even that could amount to millions of dollars. The largest U.S. public-sector retirement fund, California's CalPERS, said just 17 cents of every $100 of its portfolio was in Russian investments as the war broke out. Even so, that translated into $765 million worth of stocks, real estate and private equity. By the end of June, the value had shrunk to $194 million. The entire loss was because the holdings dropped in value; none had been sold. There is no way to know how much state government entities in the U.S. have invested in Russia or companies based there, but collectively they were worth billions of dollars before the war. Much of the money was invested in Russian government bonds, oil and coal companies as part of emerging-markets index funds. Quick to condemn the invasion, state officials said they could put pressure on Putin by dumping their Russian investments. \"Our moral imperative before these atrocities demand that you act to address Russia's aggressions and immediately restrict Russian access to California's capital and investments,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote in a letter on Feb. 28 to the boards overseeing the massive pension funds that serve teachers, state and local government workers and university employees. Across the country, governors and other top officials made similar statements. Just after the invasion began, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed an executive order calling for divestment \"to the extent possible,\" while Arizona's Board of Regents voted to exit any Russian investments. The treasurers for 36 states plus the District of Columbia and U.S. Virgin Islands signed a joint letter in March advocating divestment of publicly controlled funds from Russia. They noted a financial reason for doing so: \"The current crisis also constitutes a substantial risk for states' investments and our economic security.\" A major chunk of the government holdings in Russia is in the form of index funds that investors use to mimic overall stock market performance. Russian stocks were commonly part of funds specializing in emerging markets. MCSI and other firms that decide which stocks should be in the funds quickly dropped Russian securities. But the companies that sell investment products based on those indexes were left in the lurch, still leaving pieces of Russian stocks in their investors' portfolios. As part of the sanctions, stock markets in the U.S. and elsewhere stopped the trading of Russian stocks. And the Moscow Stock Exchange was closed for nearly a month, reopening with tight controls that keep U.S. investors from selling. The assets sank in value amid the invasion, though the precise value isn't always clear. Maryland said that as of the beginning of February, $197 million of its state retirement and pension system funds were invested in Russian assets. A month later, the state estimated the value had plunged and amounted to just $32 million. The state has been unable to unload its investments. For the handful of states in which top officials have not endorsed divestment, eroding values like that are the main reason. Shortly after the invasion, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said the number of state investments in Russia was \"minuscule\" and noted that the value was about to \"shrink to almost nothing as the Russian economy is being virtually shut off from the world.\" In Florida, Lamar Taylor, the interim executive director of the agency that oversees investments of pension funds, said during a cabinet meeting that some investment managers might seek to unload Russian assets as soon as they're able, while others could hold on in case they're worth more later. At the meeting, Gov. Ron DeSantis said the State Board of Administration has a legal responsibility to try to make money for the retirement system. \"That would violate your fiduciary duty, if you liquidated at massive losses for political reasons rather than for the best interests of the beneficiaries,\" he said. But DeSantis said there was a way to make it easier: Lawmakers passing a bill banning investment in Russia. \"If the Legislature could speak clearly, that would be something we'd welcome here, just to make sure we're not furthering investments in parts of the world that are not reflective of our interests or values,\" he said. Hank Kim, executive director of the National Conference on Public Employee Retirement Systems, said he has told member pension funds that taking steps to divest is important even if it can't be completed right away. \"The public has a right to know that it was debated in a serious manner,\" he said."},

The former TV personality's vocal support for the energy business follows years of industry donations to his nonprofit and then his campaign, according to financial records reviewed by CNBC. Oz also has a personal stake in oil and gas through investments in two major energy companies, according to his financial disclosures. Pennsylvania's next senator will be a key vote for the energy industry, as it has a major presence in the Keystone State. Pennsylvania is the nation's second-largest natural gas producer after Texas and the third-largest coal producer, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Oz backed the energy industry this year as Americans felt the strain from spiking gas prices. In a recent interview, he ripped President Joe Biden after he called on companies that run gas stations to bring down prices at the pump. \"Now, they're blaming the energy companies for the gas prices. And I'm thinking, like most Americans, what are you talking about? I mean, you did things that make it, make it impossible for these companies to exist,\" Oz said in a July interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity. He called Biden's comments \"class warfare.\" As Oz champions oil and gas in his bid to represent Pennsylvania in the Senate, both his campaign and personal coffers have benefited from the industry and its executives. Oz, a veteran physician and television host, is running against Democrat John Fetterman for a Senate seat being vacated by Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. Oz is trailing Fetterman by just under 8 percentage points in an average of recent polls, according to RealClearPolitics. Fetterman's campaign has raised over $25 million, while Oz and his team have brought in just over $18 million, according to data from the nonpartisan OpenSecrets. Oz and his wife, Lisa, have a financial stake in the industry he has championed, as they own shares of oil and gas giants ConocoPhillips and Pioneer Natural Resources, according to their financial disclosure report. The filing notes they own shares of ConocoPhillips valued between $15,001 and $50,000 and Pioneer stock valued between $1,001 and $15,000. Oz's connections to the industry formed before he pursued politics. His nonprofit HealthCorps, which promotes itself as a group aiming to help teens with their health and wellness, has seen at least $210,000 in contributions from gas and oil producer Continental Resources since 2016, according to the group's annual financial reports. Continental's support has continued into Oz's Senate bid: The company's founder and chair, Harold Hamm, endorsed Oz for Senate in an April campaign video. The backing from energy industry leaders has led to contributions to Oz's campaign. Hamm is among a group of over a dozen oil and gas industry leaders who have combined to contribute over $200,000 to Oz's campaign since he announced his run for Senate late last year, according to a CNBC review of Federal Election Commission filings. Others with ties to the oil and gas business who have donated at least $2,900 to Oz's campaign include Jimmy Haslam, an owner of the Cleveland Browns and chair of Pilot Company, a business that owns fueling stations across the country. His father and Pilot founder, James Haslam II, also donated to the Oz campaign. Other top energy donors in recent months include Brad Cox, the chair of oil producer Cox Operating, and Janet Cafaro, the president of Silcor Oilfield Services, FEC records show. Jimmy Haslam and his wife, Susan \"Dee\" Haslam, combined to give $50,000 to the pro-Oz super PAC American Leadership Action. Jimmy and Dee Haslam told CNBC in a statement that they have \"tremendous respect for the long, successful career Dr. Oz has had in the private sector and appreciate that he now wants to serve his country by bringing his expertise and experience to the United States Senate.\" The Haslam family, as of 2015, had a net worth of $6 billion, according to Forbes. Representatives for Cox and Cafaro did not return requests for comment. Hamm told CNBC in a statement that he considers Oz a \"friend.\" He said the two have known each other for almost a decade, with the goal of bringing HealthCorps' services into Oklahoma schools. Hamm explained that he believes Oz will be a key advocate for the energy sector, which has enriched the oil billionaire. He and his family have a net worth of at least $21 billion, according to Forbes. \"Dr. Oz will champion American energy in the U.S. Senate much like he's championed health his entire career,\" Hamm said. The nonprofit's annual reports from 2016 through 2020 give a range of how much donors contributed to HealthCorps. Continental Resources regularly ranked among the Oz group's top backers. The company is often listed as donating between $50,000 and $99,999 during those years. A HealthCorps filing says it received a range of $10,000 to just under $25,000 from Continental in 2018. In its earlier filings before 2016, HealthCorps lists Continental as either a \"national\" or a \"community\" sponsor. The group's website notes that its national sponsors contribute $1 million and its community donors write checks for $250,000. The disclosures pre-2016 do not say or show a range of how much the company gave those years. Oz's support from the massive energy industry coincides with an apparent shift in his opinion on fracking, which allows companies to drill deep into the earth for oil and gas resources. Critics say that fracking hurts the environment by harming water supplies and polluting the air. Before Oz ran for Senate, he repeatedly wrote columns that took aim at fracking, noting its potential threat to public health, Vice reports. \"And in Pennsylvania, there are multiple reports of air and water contamination, possibly from hydraulic fracturing sites, causing folks breathing problems, rashes, headaches, nosebleeds, numbness, nausea and vomiting,\" Oz said in a 2014 column critical of fracking. Brittany Yanick, a spokeswoman for the Oz campaign, said the candidate has not changed his view on fracking and is a strong supporter of the drilling method. She also took aim at Fetterman's position on the issue. \"As a scientist, Dr. Oz understands that, like with COVID, the Biden administration is ignoring the science and the benefits of natural gas in order to satisfy the radical Left, the same liberal Democrats that are supporting radical environmental measures and funding John Fetterman's campaign,\" Yanick said in an emailed statement. \"John Fetterman has called fracking a 'stain' on Pennsylvania, he's called for a moratorium on fracking, and he would be a rubber stamp for the failing Biden Agenda.\" Fetterman has a mixed history with where he stands on fracking. Inside Climate News reported that Fetterman dropped his support for a fracking moratorium after his failed 2016 primary run for Senate. His position evolved after the state moved toward stricter regulations on fracking. Emilia Rowland, a spokeswoman for Fetterman's campaign, told CNBC that \"John does not support a ban on fracking in Pennsylvania and that includes a moratorium on new fracking sites.\" She said he hasn't taken any campaign money from the fossil fuel industry. \"John believes fully heartedly that we have to preserve the union way of life for the thousands of workers currently employed by the natural gas industry in Pennsylvania and the communities where they live. We can't just abandon these people, and tell them to go learn how to code,\" Rowland said in a statement. \"It's a total false choice that we have to choose between jobs and a clean environment. That's just not true. We can have both.\" Still, Oz appears more vocal than Fetterman in publicly supporting the oil and gas industry. In a recent op-ed, he said it's \"gross, and deeply unpatriotic\" for oil companies to charge high gas prices while their businesses are making massive profits. Fetterman namechecked Chevron, Exxon and Shell in the op-ed. Oz has rubbed elbows with industry officials during his campaign. He was invited to a June \"energy industry meet and greet\" by longtime lobbyist Missy Edwards. The invite says the meeting was set to take place at Edwards' offices in Washington. Her current clients include Southern Company and General Motors, OpenSecrets says. A spokeswoman for General Motors said she was \"not sure if GM had a representative in attendance.\" Edwards and a representative for Southern Company did not return requests for comment."},

The funds sent back to the SBA were obtained via the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program using both fabricated information and stolen identities. The suspects used Green Dot Bank, a fintech institution, to hold and move the fraudulent funds. More than 15,000 accounts were used in the conspiracy, by individuals in the U.S. as well as domestic and transnational organized crime rings, the agency said. Investigations are ongoing and further information about suspects was not immediately released. The investigation was initiated by the Secret Service field office in Orlando, Florida, and Green Dot bank worked with the agency to identify the fraudulent accounts. \"Fraudsters in general are always looking for ways and techniques to better do their crimes and modern conveniences are just one of those things they use. So currently, cryptocurrency is a big thing, fintechs, third-party payment systems. But there's not an institution, even our traditional financial institutions, that weren't targeted during the pandemic,\" Roy Dotson, lead investigator for the Secret Service, told CNBC in an interview. Initial investigations indicated the majority of the fraudulent accounts at Green Dot were established with synthetic and stolen identities, and involved using \"willing and unwilling money mules,\" Dotson said. The Secret Service and SBA Office of Inspector General put out advisories to 30,000 financial institutions in early 2020 to lay out fraud indicators and guide the banks to partner with federal agencies to recover fraudulent funds, Dotson said. He added these investigations will likely last years due to their size and scope. Green Dot said it has partnered with federal agencies including the Secret Service to identify fraud in the industry. \"Account protection and fraud prevention are top priorities for us, and we work around the clock and invest heavily to identify, block and address fraudulent activity. We're committed to protecting customers, and also to serving as [a] proactive ally to government agencies and industry peers as we work together to prevent fraud,\" Green Dot spokeswoman Alison Lubert said in a statement. OIG Inspector General Hannibal Ware said the partnership with the Secret Service has to date resulted in more than 400 indictments and nearly 300 convictions related to pandemic fraud. The U.S. government allocated more than $1 trillion to Main Street under both the Paycheck Protection Program and EIDL program. The PPP allowed small businesses to borrow loans that may be forgiven if the borrower used the majority of the capital on payroll, while the Covid-19 EIDL program allowed borrowers to access loans based on temporary losses of revenue due to the pandemic. An advance grant was also available under the EIDL. Reviews of the two programs by the SBA's Office of Inspector General warned that criminals would potentially exploit the system due to the fast-moving nature of the rollout and demand for aid. CNBC investigations revealed, in some cases, how easy it was for criminals to obtain fraudulent aid via stolen identities. The SBA OIG said it has identified $87 billion of potentially fraudulent EIDL loans. Over the past two years, the Secret Service said it has seized over $1.4 billion in fraudulently obtained funds and assisted in returning some $2.3 billion to state unemployment insurance programs. Nearly 4,000 pandemic-related fraud investigations and inquiries have been initiated by the Secret Service. More than 150 field offices and 40 cyber task forces are involved. \"This is not going to be a quick fix. As we talked about today, 15,325 accounts at one financial institution \u2014 this is one case, so you can just think of the potential number of suspects and how many investigations that could come out of those. And with all of our federal, state and local partners working this and having the same mission. It's going to be a long process,\" Dotson said at a news conference announcing the returned funds."},

The Justice Department argued in a court filing that Trump lacks the legal standing to appoint a special master. Appointing that watchdog could harm national security, the agency warned. The department also said it has evidence that government records likely were concealed and removed from a storage room at Trump's home at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, \"and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation.\" Trump had sued to block the Justice Department from further investigating any materials taken in the raid until a court-appointed special master is able to analyze them. That step is typically taken when there is a chance that some evidence should be withheld from prosecutors because of various legal privileges. \"As an initial matter, the former President lacks standing to seek judicial relief or oversight as to Presidential records because those records do not belong to him,\" the DOJ wrote to Judge Aileen Cannon in U.S. District Court in southern Florida. Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, has set a hearing for Thursday at 1 p.m. ET in a West Palm Beach courthouse. Trump's legal team has until Wednesday night to reply to the DOJ's latest submission. The DOJ is conducting a criminal investigation of the removal of White House documents and their shipment to Trump's residence at Mar-a-Lago when he left office. By law, presidential records must be turned over to the National Archives and Records Administration when a president departs office. The National Archives and Records Administration retrieved 15 boxes of records from Mar-a-Lago in January. The next month, NARA sent a referral to the DOJ that the records contained \"highly classified documents intermingled with other records,\" according to the affidavit used to obtain the warrant for the Aug. 8 search of Trump's home. The DOJ said in Tuesday night's filing that the FBI had \"uncovered multiple sources of evidence indicating ... that classified documents remained\" at Mar-a-Lago. \"The government also developed evidence that government records were likely concealed and removed from the Storage Room and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation,\" the DOJ wrote. That evidence contradicted a sworn certification letter on June 3 from the custodian of Trump's records, claiming that \"any and all\" documents responsive to a grand jury subpoena had been handed over, the DOJ wrote. The August search \"cast serious doubt on the claim in the certification ... that there had been 'a diligent search' for records responsive to the grand jury subpoena,\" according to the DOJ's filing. Of the evidence taken in that raid, \"over one hundred unique documents with classification markings \u2014 that is, more than twice the amount produced on June 3, 2022, in response to the grand jury subpoena \u2014 were seized,\" the DOJ wrote. \"That the FBI, in a matter of hours, recovered twice as many documents with classification markings as the 'diligent search' that the former President's counsel and other representatives had weeks to perform calls into serious question the representations made in the June 3 certification and casts doubt on the extent of cooperation in this matter,\" the DOJ wrote. The prosecutors also argued against the appointment of a special master, saying it is \"unnecessary\" and that doing so \"would significantly harm important governmental interests, including national security interests.\" That harm could include impeding the intelligence community's \"ongoing review of the national security risk\" that may have been caused by \"improper storage of these highly sensitive materials,\" the DOJ argued. The prosecutors concluded that Cannon should reject Trump's requests \"and decline to require the return of seized items, enjoin further review of seized materials, or appoint a special master.\" Tuesday's filing came one day after the DOJ told Cannon that its review of the seized materials was complete. The DOJ told the court on Monday that a law enforcement team had identified a \"limited set\" of materials that may be protected by attorney-client privilege. That privilege often refers to the legal doctrine that protects the confidentiality of communications between an attorney and their client. The so-called privilege review team \u2014 which is separate from the investigation that led the FBI to search Trump's residence earlier this month \u2014 is following a process to \"address potential privilege disputes, if any,\" the DOJ wrote. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence \"is also leading an intelligence community assessment of the potential risk to national security that would result from the disclosure of these materials,\" according to the filing. Before the DOJ posted its late-night response, a group of former government officials asked the judge to let them file a brief as \"amici curiae\" \u2014 Latin for \"friends of the court\" \u2014 arguing against Trump's requests. The group included six former federal prosecutors who served in Republican administrations, as well as former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who governed as a Republican but backed President Joe Biden over Trump in 2020."},

The \"limited set\" of potentially privileged information was identified by a team that is kept separate from the investigative squad that searched Trump's Palm Beach, Florida, residence earlier this month, DOJ officials said in a court filing in U.S. District Court in southern Florida on Monday morning. The so-called privilege review team \"completed its review of those materials\" and is following a process to \"address potential privilege disputes, if any,\" according to that filing. Attorney-client privilege often refers to the legal doctrine that protects the confidentiality of communications between an attorney and their client.

The agency disclosed the privilege team's review one week after Trump sued to block the DOJ from further investigating any materials taken in the raid until a court-appointed \"special master\" is able to analyze them. Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, gave notice Saturday of her \"preliminary intent to appoint a special master\" in the case. Cannon ordered the government to publicly respond to Trump by Tuesday. She also ordered the DOJ to submit a sealed filing that provides more details about the seized materials, and she set a hearing for Thursday at 1 p.m. ET in a West Palm Beach courthouse. In response, top DOJ counterintelligence official Jay Bratt assured the judge that the government will comply with those orders. But \"the government notes that, before the Court issued its Preliminary Order, and in accordance with the judicially authorized search warrant's provisions, the Privilege Review Team ... identified a limited set of materials that potentially contain attorney-client privileged information\" and \"completed its review of those materials,\" Bratt wrote. The DOJ and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, or ODNI, \"are currently facilitating a classification review of materials recovered\" from Trump's residence, Bratt added. The ODNI \"is also leading an intelligence community assessment of the potential risk to national security that would result from the disclosure of these materials,\" he wrote. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to answer reporters' specific questions about the DOJ probe later Monday, stressing that the agency is conducting its investigation independently and \"we have not been involved.\" She noted, however, neither President Joe Biden nor anyone else at the White House has been briefed on the matter, but declined to comment on any classified materials prepared for the president. Trump's civil lawsuit is being overseen by a different judge than the one who approved the search warrant for Mar-a-Lago. The affidavit for that search warrant \u2014 in which an FBI agent explained why the government had probable cause to believe the search would turn up evidence of illegality \u2014 was released Friday, albeit with heavy redactions. The National Archives and Records Administration retrieved 15 boxes of records from Mar-a-Lago in January. The next month, NARA sent a referral to the DOJ that the records contained \"highly classified documents intermingled with other records,\" according to the affidavit. By law, presidential records must be turned over to the National Archives when a president departs office. The FBI launched a criminal investigation and found that the 15 boxes included 184 specific documents marked classified, 67 of which were marked \"confidential,\" 92 marked \"secret\" and 25 marked \"top secret,\" according to the affidavit. The search warrant was revealed days after the FBI entered Mar-a-Lago in August. It indicated that FBI agents were looking for materials showing violations of laws against obstruction of justice and the removal of official records, as well as the U.S. Espionage Act. The FBI took at least 20 boxes of items in the August raid, including numerous sets of highly classified documents, according to a property receipt that was also made public by the DOJ."},

The judge scheduled a Thursday hearing to discuss the matter further. A special master is often a former judge. Cannon also directed the Justice Department to file under seal with her more detailed descriptions of the material taken from Trump's property. The former president's lawyers have complained that investigators did not disclose enough information to them about what specific documents were removed when agents executed a search warrant on Aug. 8 to look for classified documents.

John Eastman also invoked protections under attorney-client privilege in refusing to answer at least some questions he was asked before the grand jury, which was convened as part of a criminal probe into the possibility of illegal interference in Georgia's presidential election contest, his attorneys said. Eastman is one of a group of Trump allies who were subpoenaed by that panel, which is hearing testimony in Atlanta. A second ally, Trump's former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, has been named a target in that investigation and recently testified before the same grand jury. Eastman wrote a series of memos after the 2020 election calling on then-Vice President Mike Pence to effectively undo President Joe Biden 's win by refusing to certify the Electoral College results. \"In his appearance before the Fulton County Special Grand Jury, we advised our client John Eastman to assert attorney-client privilege and the constitutional right to remain silent where appropriate,\" Eastman's lawyers, Charles Burnham and Harvey Silverglate, said in a statement. \"Out of respect for grand jury secrecy we will not disclose the substance of the questions or testimony. We wish to thank the grand jurors for their service,\" the attorneys said. The statement also blasted Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis for the probe itself. \"By all indications, the District Attorney's Office has set itself on an unprecedented path of criminalizing controversial or disfavored legal theories, possibly in hopes that the federal government will follow its lead,\" the lawyers said. \"Criminalization of unpopular legal theories is against every American tradition and would have ended the careers of John Adams, Ruth Ginsburg, Thurgood Marshall and many other now-celebrated American lawyers,\" the statement said. Adams was the second president of the United States, while Ginsburg and Marshall were Supreme Court justices who helped establish new legal precedents with their work during the civil rights movement. \"We ask all interested observers of any political persuasion to join us in decrying this troubling development,\" Burnham and Silverglate wrote. Eastman last month revealed that his cellphone was seized by federal agents who stopped him in New Mexico and forced him to unlock it. That seizure was done as part of an investigation by the Justice Department's internal watchdog, the Office of the Inspector General. The IG's office is probing the role of the Justice Department and its components in \"preparing for and responding to\" the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters, according to the office's website. That riot occurred as a joint session of Congress was convened to certify Biden's victory, with Pence presiding over the proceedings. A former Justice Department official, Jeffrey Clark, had electronics seized from his Virginia home on the same day that Eastman's phone was seized. Clark also backed Trump's effort to overturn the election. Trump considered installing Clark as attorney general in the days leading up to Jan. 6, 2021, but dropped the idea after a group of top Justice officials said they would resign in protest if that happened."},

Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and FBI agents along with NYPD detectives were seen carrying boxes during a search of 19 Duck Pond Lane in Southampton, N.Y., and the search of 515 Park Ave. in Manhattan. Records show those properties are linked to sanctioned Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, a billionaire and close ally of President Vladimir Putin who heads the Moscow-based Renova Group, a conglomerate with interests in the metals, mining, and tech industries, according to U.S. Treasury Department documents. A search is also underway at a property on Miami's Fisher Island that authorities say was linked to Vekselberg, according to sources familiar with the matter. The U.S. seizure of Vekselberg's $900 million superyacht in early April marked the first under newly imposed Western sanctions targeting assets of Russian elites in response to the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. Vekselberg is one of numerous Russian oligarchs to face sanctions since the start of the war. In addition to sanctions, Vekselberg has been the subject of a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into allegations of bank fraud. No charges have been filed in that case. All of Vekselberg's assets in the U.S. are frozen and American companies are barred from doing business with him and his entities. The Ukrainian-born businessman built his fortune by investing in the aluminum and oil industries in the post-Soviet era. Vekselberg has long had ties to the U.S., including a green card he once held and homes in New York and Connecticut. He was also questioned in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. A call to an attorney associated with the Hamptons property was not immediately returned Thursday. Attempts to reach a representative for Vekselberg were not immediately successful. HSI and FBI confirmed their agents were at those locations but declined further comment. The U.S. Department of Justice and NYPD declined immediate comment. Correction: This article has been updated to correct the location of the U.S. seizure of Vekselberg's $900 million superyacht."},

But details of how many of those records the Mazars USA accounting firm will turn over were not included in a committee statement announcing the agreement Thursday. The deal does not cover a separate lawsuit involving the House Ways and Means Committee, which is seeking Trump's federal tax returns from 2015 through 2020. Last month, a federal appeals court said the Ways and Means Committee could get those returns. The agreement with the Oversight Committee came nearly two months after another panel of judges in the same appeals court in Washington, D.C., upheld a prior ruling that the Oversight Committee had the authority to subpoena certain of Trump's financial records from Mazars in furtherance of legislative purposes. However, the appeals court also told the committee to winnow the scope of the records it wanted to see. On Wednesday, Trump's lawyers told the court in a filing that in light of the settlement agreement with the Oversight Committee, he would drop a motion seeking a rehearing of the case, and a related one asking that the entire lineup of judges on the appeals court take up the issue. In a statement, committee Chairwoman Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said, \"After facing years of delay tactics, the Committee has now reached an agreement with the former President and his accounting firm, Mazars USA, to obtain critical documents.\" \"These documents will inform the Committee's efforts to get to the bottom of former President Trump's egregious conduct and ensure that future presidents do not abuse their position of power for personal gain,\" Maloney said. The committee said that under the agreement, \"Mazars USA has agreed to comply with the court's order and produce responsive documents to the Committee as expeditiously as possible.\" A lawyer for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The committee sought the documents in 2019 as part of its investigation into Trump's conflicts of interest involving his businesses while serving as president and his foreign financial ties. The panel issued its subpoena to Mazars for Trump's records after his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, testified to the Oversight Committee that Trump's financial statements had falsely represented his financial position. Trump then sued to block Mazars from surrendering the records. The case ended up before the Supreme Court, which in 2020 sent the lawsuit back to lower federal courts with the direction to apply a new standard for evaluating the merit of congressional subpoenas for a president's personal information."},

The narrowly focused filing in U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach came one day after the Department of Justice argued that appointing a special master could harm the government's national security interests. The DOJ's filing also said that \"efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation\" into the records that had been shipped to Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence after the end of his presidency. And the DOJ revealed that the FBI seized more than 100 classified documents from the Palm Beach resort during its search of the premises earlier this month. The agency also shared a redacted FBI photo showing documents with classification markings that had been recovered from a container in Trump's \"45 Office.\" Trump's legal team in its Wednesday night reply accused the DOJ of twisting \"the framework of responding to a motion for a Special Master into an all-encompassing challenge to any judicial consideration, presently or in the future, of any aspect of its unprecedented behavior in this investigation.\" The government's \"extraordinary document\" suggests \"that the DOJ, and the DOJ alone, should be entrusted with the responsibility of evaluating its unjustified pursuit of criminalizing a former President's possession of personal and Presidential records in a secure setting,\" Trump's lawyers wrote. They also accused the DOJ of providing multiple \"misleading or incomplete statement[s] of purported 'fact,'\" but offered few specifics. Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, has set a hearing for Thursday at 1 p.m. ET in a West Palm Beach courthouse. Trump had sued to block the Justice Department from further investigating any materials taken in the Mar-a-Lago raid until a special master is able to analyze them. That step is typically taken when there is a chance that some evidence should be withheld from prosecutors because of various legal privileges. The DOJ told the judge on Monday that its review of the seized materials was complete, and that a law enforcement team had identified a \"limited set\" of materials that may be protected by attorney-client privilege. That privilege often refers to the legal doctrine that protects the confidentiality of communications between an attorney and their client. Trump's lawyers responded Wednesday that the so-called privilege review team was \"wholly deficient\" in identifying and separating all potentially privileged documents from the rest of the seized materials. Trump and his office have publicly claimed that he declassified all the documents that had been seized by the FBI. But Trump's legal team has not made that explicit argument in the civil lawsuit before Cannon. The DOJ in Tuesday's late-night filing said that when 15 boxes were retrieved from Mar-a-Lago by the National Archives in January, Trump \"never asserted executive privilege over any of the documents nor claimed that any of the documents in the boxes containing classification markings had been declassified.\" The government also said that no claims about declassification were made when FBI agents went to Mar-a-Lago on June 3, pursuant to a grand jury subpoena to collect any more records in Trump's possession that bore classification markings. The DOJ said it obtained that subpoena in May, after the FBI developed evidence that dozens of boxes with classified information \u2014 beyond the 15 boxes retrieved in January \u2014 were still at Trump's residence. \"When producing the documents, neither counsel nor the custodian asserted that the former President had declassified the documents or asserted any claim of executive privilege. Instead, counsel handled them in a manner that suggested counsel believed that the documents were classified: the production included a single Redweld envelope, double-wrapped in tape, containing the documents,\" the DOJ wrote. At the same time, Trump's custodian of records had also provided a sworn certification letter, claiming that \"any and all\" documents responsive to a grand jury subpoena had been handed over, the DOJ wrote. But the FBI later \"uncovered multiple sources of evidence\" indicating that more classified documents remained at Mar-a-Lago, according to the DOJ's filing. \"The government also developed evidence that government records were likely concealed and removed from the Storage Room and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation,\" the DOJ wrote. That and other information led the government to seek a warrant to search Mar-a-Lago, which was ultimately carried out Aug. 8. In their reply on Wednesday, Trump's lawyers wrote that the DOJ's account of the June 3 meeting \"has been significantly mischaracterized.\" \"If the Government provided the same untrue account in the affidavit in support of the search warrant, then they misled the Magistrate Judge,\" the former president's lawyers wrote. Trump, in a social media post earlier Wednesday evening, also accused the DOJ of being \"very deceiving\" by sharing a photo that appears to show numerous classified papers strewn about on a carpeted floor. Trump clarified that the FBI \"took them out of cartons and spread them around on the carpet, making it look like a big 'find' for them.\" \"They dropped them, not me - Very deceiving...And remember, we could have NO representative, including lawyers, present during the Raid. They were told to wait outside,\" Trump wrote."},

Charlie Crist resigns from Congress as he takes on GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis in Florida ", "paragraphs": " Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist announced Wednesday he will resign from Congress as he campaigns to unseat Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in November. The move will shrink Democrats' already-slim majority in the House, potentially complicating efforts to pass more legislation before the midterm elections when Republicans are currently favored to take control. Serving in Congress \"has been an honor and a privilege,\" Crist said in a statement, which did not mention his campaign for governor. \"From the bottom of my heart, thank you for trusting me as your Representative in Washington.\" Crist will step down by the close of business Wednesday, he said in the statement. Congressional staff for Crist's district will provide casework and constituent services until the next representatives are sworn in in January, the statement said. Florida's 13th Congressional District, where Crist has served since 2017, is considered a likely pickup for Republicans this November, according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. The district's political makeup shifted toward the GOP after a new congressional map, proposed by DeSantis, re-shaped the area. Crist handily won the Democratic nomination for Florida's gubernatorial race. But polls show him trailing DeSantis, a dominant figure in the GOP who is widely rumored to be gearing up for a 2024 presidential run. DeSantis has also far outraised Crist: The powerful Republican incumbent governor's campaign has raised more than $165 million since 2019, OpenSecrets reported earlier this month. DeSantis' stature in the party is exceeded perhaps only by former President Donald Trump, who has regularly teased the possibility of launching another White House bid. Crist's move mirrors DeSantis' decision in 2018 to resign from Congress as he campaigned for governor in a hotly contested race against Democrat Andrew Gillum. DeSantis at the time said that he did not want to be criticized for taking a U.S. representative's paycheck while missing votes."},

The letter dated Friday from National Intelligence Director (DNI) Avril Haines to House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff and Oversight Committee chair Carolyn Maloney also said the Justice Department and DNI \"are working together to facilitate a classification review\" of materials including those recovered during the search. Schiff and Maloney said in a joint statement they were pleased the government was \"assessing the damage caused by the improper storage of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.\" Politico reported the letter earlier. The Justice Department on Friday disclosed that it was investigating Trump for removing White House records because it believed he illegally held documents including some involving intelligence-gathering and clandestine human sources \u2014 among America's most closely held secrets. Haines said DNI \"will also lead an Intelligence Community (IC) assessment of the potential risk to national security that would result from the disclosure of the relevant documents\" including those seized. The Justice Department on Friday released a heavily redacted affidavit that underpinned the FBI's extraordinary search of Mar-a-Lago in which agents seized 11 sets of classified records including some labeled \"top secret\" as documents that could gravely threaten national security if exposed. In the affidavit, an unidentified FBI agent said the agency reviewed and identified 184 documents \"bearing classification markings\" containing \"national defense information\" after Trump in January returned 15 boxes of government records sought by the U.S. National Archives. Other records in those boxes, according to the affidavit, bore handwritten notes by Trump. Schiff and Maloney said the Justice Department release Friday \"affirms our grave concern that among the documents stored at Mar-a-Lago were those that could endanger human sources. It is critical that the IC move swiftly to assess and, if necessary, to mitigate the damage done.\" The search was part of a federal investigation into whether Trump illegally removed and kept documents when he left office in January 2021 after losing the 2020 election to President Joe Biden and whether Trump tried to obstruct the probe. Trump, a Republican who is considering another presidential run in 2024, has described the court-approved search at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach as politically motivated, and on Friday again described it as a \"break-in.\""},

The president's remarks came after Idaho-based microchip manufacturer Micron announced plans Thursday to invest approximately $15 billion over the next decade in a new memory manufacturing facility in Boise. The lab, which is the first of its kind built in America in over 20 years, is projected to create 17,000 new American jobs by the end of 2032, according to the company. \"Today's announcement by Micron is another big win for America,\" Biden said in a statement. Micron President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra thanked the Biden administration and members of Congress for bipartisan support of the CHIPS Act \"which made this investment decision possible.\" \"This is the first of Micron's multiple planned U.S. investments following the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act, and represents the largest private investment ever made in Idaho,\" Mehrotra said in a statement. \"Our new leading-edge memory manufacturing fab will fuel U.S. technology leadership, ensuring a reliable domestic supply of semiconductors that is critical to economic and national security.\" Over $52 billion was allotted to U.S. companies producing computer chips under the act, along with billions in tax credits to spur investments in semiconductor manufacturing to enable the U.S. to compete with East Asia. The region accounts for 75% of global production of semiconductors. Biden signed the CHIPS Act into law in early August. Micron first announced a $40 billion investment in memory chip manufacturing at that time. The investment, said the White House, will create 40,000 new jobs in construction and manufacturing and raise the U.S. market share of memory chip production from less than 2% to up to 10% over the next 10 years. In his statement Thursday, Biden also mentioned similar growth projections from manufacturing companies First Solar, Toyota, Honda and Corning over the past week. The announcements are a \"direct result of my economic plan,\" he said. Solar power company First Solar announced $1.2 billion in developments Tuesday, including a new factory in the southeastern part of the country and an expansion of its Northwest Ohio manufacturing footprint. The investments will add at least 850 new manufacturing jobs with the additional goal of supporting over 15,000 jobs by 2025, according to a press release. Vehicle manufacturers Toyota and Honda revealed a respective $2.5 billion additional investment in Toyota's North American battery manufacturing facility and a $4.4 billion joint venture with LG Energy Solutions to manufacture lithium-ion batteries in the U.S. that will power Honda and Acura EV models for the domestic market. Toyota's new venture will add 350 jobs, bringing total employment to approximately 2,100, according to a statement. A representative for Honda did not respond to a request for comment before publication. Corning, a New York-based advanced optics manufacturer, said Tuesday it is partnering with AT&T in a new optical cable manufacturing facility in Arizona. The facility will bring approximately 250 jobs to the area and is expected to open in 2024, according to a press release. \"In our future, we will make EVs, chips, fiber optics, and other critical components here in America, and we will have an economy built from the bottom up and middle out,\" Biden said Thursday. The economy has added 3.3 million jobs this year as the unemployment rate has fallen to 3.5%, tied for the lowest since 1969. For August, payrolls growth is expected to rise by 318,000 after growing by 528,000 in July. However, Federal Reserve officials have warned that their intentions to continue raising interest rates to combat inflation could raise the level of unemployment in the months ahead. \u2014 CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this article."},

Judge Aileen Cannon also will make public a status report by the investigation team probing the removal of documents from the White House when Trump left office in early 2021. But Cannon ended the hearing without ruling on a pending request by Trump to appoint an independent watchdog, known as a special master, who would review government documents seized by the FBI before the Department of Justice would be allowed to use the records to advance its probe. Cannon said she will rule later on that request, which Trump made in a lawsuit filed last month in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Trump's lawyers had requested a more detailed list of documents taken from Mar-a-Lago than the less revealing inventory they have previously received from investigators. The DOJ is opposing the call for a special master, arguing that it will unjustifiably delay its criminal investigation. The Justice Department also has said that a review of the documents by a team of internal department watchdogs already has completed its own review and identified some records that would potentially be exempt from use in the investigation because they are protected by attorney-client privilege. In a separate ruling Thursday, Cannon said she will keep sealed a status report on that review by the DOJ's so-called filter team. Jay Bratt, the DOJ's top counterintelligence official, also argued at the hearing that Trump is not entitled to a review of the documents by a special master because \"he is no longer the president.\" \"And because he's no longer the president, he had no right to those documents ... that ends the analysis,\" Bratt said. Special masters, often drawn from the ranks of retired judges, are typically appointed in cases where there is a risk that some of the records seized by law enforcement should be barred from use in an investigation because they are protected by attorney-client privilege. Trump's lawyers, however, argue that some of the records could be protected by executive privilege that would result from him having been president at the time they were created. In a court filing Tuesday, the DOJ revealed that more than 100 classified documents were found at Mar-a-Lago, the private club in Palm Beach, Florida, where Trump maintains a residence, during the Aug. 8 raid. That discovery came two months after Trump's lawyers, in response to a federal grand jury subpoena, provided the DOJ with a sworn certification that a search of Trump's living quarters and office had not found records that were marked classified. Tuesday's filing said there is evidence that government records including the ones marked classified were likely concealed and removed from a storage room at that residence in an effort to \"obstruct the government's investigation.\" Authorities have said the National Archives and Records Administration tried for about a year after Trump left the White House in January 2021 to obtain documents it suspected were still in his possession. When Trump did give up 15 boxes of records from Mar-a-Lago earlier this year, they were found to contain highly classified material, leading to the opening of the DOJ probe, and eventually the Aug. 8 raid. Trump has argued that he declassified the records before leaving office. But whether or not the documents remain classified is irrelevant under the criminal laws that the DOJ is eyeing in the case, which include the espionage statute and obstruction of justice. By law, White House records must be turned over to NARA when a president leaves office. During Thursday's hearing, Trump lawyer Jim Trusty repeated an analogy that has become popular among defenders of the former president on the records issue. \"We've characterized it at times as an overdue library book scenario where there's a dispute \u2014 not even a dispute \u2014 but ongoing negotiations with [the National Archives] that has suddenly been transformed into a criminal investigation,\" Trusty said, according to NBC News. Trusty's claim omitted mention of a grand jury subpoena issued for the documents."},

The previously unreported photo, released by the War College to Reuters after a request under the Freedom of Information Act, showed Mastriano in a 2013-14 portrait for the Department of Military Strategy, Plans, and Operations, where he worked. Faculty at the time had been given the option of dressing as a historical figure, people familiar with the photo said. At least 15 of the 21 faculty in the photo opted to appear in regular attire. Although one man wears a trench coat and sunglasses and another carries an aviator's helmet, Mastriano is the only one wearing a Confederate uniform. Mastriano did not immediately respond to requests for comment made by email and phone. A Reuters reporter attended a Mastriano event on Wednesday to seek comment, but the candidate did not make himself available for questions. Displays of Confederate symbols can be seen as insensitive to those who view them as painful reminders of racial oppression and the Civil War that saw 11 rebelling Confederate states fight to keep Black people enslaved. The U.S. military issued a de facto ban on displaying the Confederate flag and has sought to remove segregationist symbols from bases and academic institutions following the murder in May 2020 of George Floyd, a Black man whose killing by a white police officer in Minneapolis triggered protests worldwide. After Reuters made its formal request for the photo, it was removed from the War College wall where it had hung alongside other annual portraits of faculty groups. The Army War College (AWC), a premier military higher education institution in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, told Reuters a team had reviewed all art, text, and other images displayed at Carlisle Barracks in 2020, but missed the faculty photo. \"The faculty photo did not get the team's attention; the photo has since been removed because it does not meet AWC values,\" the college said in a statement. Asked about the War College photo, a spokesperson at U.S. Army headquarters said: \"The Army supports commanders who remove symbols or images that do not comport with Army values.\" Confederate symbols and dress have been embraced by white supremacists in the United States, and monuments and flags honoring the Confederacy have been removed from many public areas in recent years. Pennsylvania plays an outsized role in U.S. politics as a so-called swing state in presidential elections, and Republican Mastriano, who has embraced Trump's stolen election lies, is trailing his Democratic opponent in the governor's race ahead of the November ballot. It is unclear how the photo might be viewed in Pennsylvania, which played a critical role in the Civil War. More than 33,000 soldiers from Pennsylvania died fighting for the Union, and the state was the site of the Battle of Gettysburg, the conflict's bloodiest battle, which ended with a Union victory and inspired President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. Mastriano's district, Pennsylvania's 33rd, includes Gettysburg. Many Americans continue to participate in Civil War battle re-enactments, wearing uniforms from both sides in an effort to preserve U.S. history."},

It was already known that the conservative advocate Ginni Thomas had contacted legislators in Arizona with a similar request seeking to undo Biden's victory there. The Washington Post first reported Thursday that she wrote two Republican legislators in Wisconsin, state Sen. Kathy Bernier and state Rep. Gary Tauchen, on Nov. 9, 2020, at \"virtually the same time the Arizona lawmakers received a verbatim copy of the message from Thomas.\" Bernier at the time was the chair of the state Senate elections committee. Thomas sent the emails days after Trump refused to concede the election to Biden, vowing, \"We'll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court.\" The subject lines of her messages read, \"Please do your Constitutional duty!\" \"Please stand strong in the face of media and political pressure,\" those emails said, according to The Post, which obtained them from the watchdog group Documented. \"Please reflect on the awesome authority granted to you by our Constitution. And then please take action to ensure that a clean slate of Electors is chosen for our state,\" Thomas wrote. Documented obtained the emails through a request under Wisconsin's public records laws. The group posted a copy of the emails online later Thursday. The report comes more than a month after Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said the select House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, pro-Trump riot at the U.S. Capitol was considering issuing a subpoena to Ginni Thomas. Thomas sent the emails to Arizona and Wisconsin lawmakers via the online site FreeRoots, which provides pre-written messages that can be sent to multiple elected officials. Arizona and Wisconsin sent Biden electors to the Electoral College, as he won the popular vote in both states. The Electoral College then named him the winner of the 2020 vote. A lawyer for Thomas and a spokeswoman for the Supreme Court did not immediately respond to requests for comment from CNBC about her emails. Thomas' advocacy for conservative causes while her husband serves on the high court has generated controversy in recent years. Thomas sent 29 messages to Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows after the 2020 election encouraging him to pursue then-ongoing efforts to undo Biden's victory, CBS News reported in March. \"Help This Great President stand firm, Mark!!! ...You are the leader, with him, who is standing for America's constitutional governance at the precipice,\" she wrote Meadows on Nov. 10, 2020. \"The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History.\" Several efforts to effectively overturn Trump's losses in battleground states ended up at the Supreme Court after the election. None of those efforts succeeded. In January, Clarence Thomas was the only Supreme Court justice to support Trump's request to block White House records from being sent to the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot. That riot began after Trump and his allies falsely claimed for weeks that he had actually won the presidential election and that Biden's victory was the result of widespread ballot fraud in states that included Arizona and Wisconsin. The violence disrupted a joint session of Congress for hours as lawmakers gathered to confirm Biden's Electoral College win."},

The remarks from the former head of the DOJ came as court documents revealed more information about the agency's criminal investigation into the shipment of classified government records to Mar-a-Lago after Trump left the White House. FBI agents found four dozen empty document folders marked \"CLASSIFIED\" during their raid last month of Trump's club, a newly unsealed court file revealed earlier Friday. Forty-three of those folders were collected from Trump's office, the court filing said. The Aug. 8 raid came months after the National Archives retrieved 15 boxes of materials from Trump's Palm Beach, Florida, resort home in January. FBI agents went to Mar-a-Lago in June to collect all additional records that bore classification markings. But the FBI later \"uncovered multiple sources of evidence\" indicating that more classified documents remained at Mar-a-Lago, leading them to seek a warrant to search the premises, according to a DOJ court filing. Barr said Friday that the search warrant suggests that \"for them to have taken things to the current point they probably have pretty good evidence, but that's speculation.\" Barr also cast doubt on Trump's claims that he declassified the documents that were taken from Mar-a-Lago, calling it \"highly improbable.\" But if Trump indeed \"stood over scores of boxes, not really knowing what was in them and said, I hereby declassify everything in here that would be such an abuse and that shows such recklessness that it's almost worse than taking the documents,\" Barr said. Barr was sworn in as Trump's attorney general in February 2019. He oversaw the controversial public release of former special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian meddling and possible coordination with the Trump campaign in the 2016 election. Critics accused him of misrepresenting the Mueller report's conclusions when he released a four-page summary of it weeks before the full report came out. Less than a month after Trump lost to President Joe Biden in the 2020 election, Barr publicly split with his boss by undermining his false claims that the race was rigged through widespread fraud. Trump has maintained that the race was rigged against him, even after he left office on Jan. 20, 2021. As recently as this week, Trump has demanded that he should either be declared the \"rightful winner,\" or that a do-over election should be held \"immediately.\" Barr, in an interview published Dec. 1, 2020, told The Associated Press that the DOJ has \"not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.\" Trump announced Barr's resignation two weeks later."},

Agents found 43 of those empty folders marked classified in Trump's office, according to the Department of Justice's inventory of the seized items, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The remaining five empty folders with that marking were found in containers in a storage room. The FBI also found another 42 empty folders marked \"Return to Staff Secretary/Miliary [sic] Aide,\" during the Aug. 8 raid, which was authorized to search for government documents removed from the White House when Trump left office in Jan. 2021, the filing said. Twenty-eight of those empty folders were found in Trump's office, while another 14 were in a storage room elsewhere, the document shows. And FBI agents found more than 10,000 government documents and photographs without classification markings, the filing shows. Among those were hundreds of photos and news articles, along with gifts, clothing, and books. The bombshell revelations raise the prospect that the DOJ has not yet recovered the documents that would have been in the empty folders. The DOJ is investigating possible crimes related to the removal of those and other government documents from the White House when Trump left office in Jan. 2021. By law, such records must be turned over to the National Archives and Records Administration. On Tuesday, the DOJ said in another court filing that more than 100 classified documents were found at Mar-a-Lago. That property receipt noted that the government seized 11 sets of classified documents, as well as an executive grant of clemency regarding Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative and Trump confidant. The previously disclosed property inventory of items seized lists multiple U.S. government documents with \"confidential,\" \"secret\" and \"top secret\" classification markings. The detailed inventory made public Friday was one of two court filings related to the FBI raid that were ordered unsealed by Judge Aileen Cannon after she conducted a hearing Thursday on a request by Trump's lawyers to appoint a third-party to review the seized records. The other document unsealed Friday is titled, \"Notice of Investigative Team of Status of Review,\" and notes that the criminal probe did not end with the raid. It was signed by Miami U.S. Attorney Juan Gonzalez, and Jay Bratt, the chief of the counterintelligence and export control section of the national security division of the Justice Department. \"The seized materials will continue to be used to further the government's investigation, and the investigative team will continue to use and evaluate the seized materials as it takes further investigative steps, such as through additional interviews and grand jury practice,\" that notice says. \"It is important to note, 'review' of the seized materials is not a single investigative step but an ongoing process in this active criminal investigation,\" the document says. Trump's spokesman in a series of tweets about the inventory of the seized items again criticized the raid. \"The new 'detailed' inventory list only further proves that this unprecedented and unnecessary raid of President Trump's home was not some surgical, confined search and retrieval that the Biden administration claims, it was a SMASH AND GRAB,\" wrote the spokesman, Taylor Budowich. \"These document disputes should be resolved under the Presidential Records Act, which requires cooperation and negotiation by NARA [National Archives and Records Administration], not an armed FBI raid,\" Budowich added. Trump in a lawsuit filed in late August asked Cannon to appoint an independent watchdog, known as a special master, to review the items seized in the search before the DOJ is allowed to continue using the documents in the investigation. Trump's lawyers have said a special master could check to see if some documents would be prohibited from being used in the probe because they are protected by either attorney-client privilege or executive privilege. The DOJ has opposed the appointment of a special master, saying that it would delay the investigation, and that Trump does not own the documents. Cannon, during a court hearing in Florida on that dispute Thursday, said she will issue a ruling on the special master request in \"due course.\" Cannon, a Trump appointee, previously shared her \"preliminary intent\" to grant Trump's request for a special master. The judge suggested in Thursday's hearing that she is still considering that appointment, news outlets reported."},

The allegations against Kristina Karamo, which she denied in a statement late Friday afternoon, came to light two months before the election for secretary of state, the top election official of Michigan. Michigan is one of several states that Trump falsely claims he lost due to widespread ballot fraud in the 2020 presidential election against President Joe Biden. Karamo has backed those claims. Trump, when he endorsed Karamo, said, \"Good luck Kristina, and while you're at it, check out the fake election results that took place in the city of Detroit.\" Her ex-husband Adom Karamo made the explosive allegations about her in a Michigan family court filing last October as he asked the court to award him 75 days of overnight stays with their daughters at his home in Florida during their breaks from school. The filing was first obtained and published by the online site Jezebel.com. Kristina on one occasion said, \"F--- it, I'll kill us all,\" as she tried to grab the steering wheel and \"crash\" a car driven by her husband, and carrying their two teenagers, Adom wrote in the filing. In his motion last fall, Adom Karamo also alleged that Kristina, who is a community college professor, was \"committed to an institution for evaluation due to her efforts at self-harm and suicide.\" \"Father was in fact trapped in the marriage for years, always subject to the threat of Mother committing suicide,\" he wrote. Adom wrote that he did not believe at the time of the motion that Kristina \"is currently in this state of mind, as this was several years ago.\" \"| do believe, however, that her children have been the only thing that has kept her sane,\" he added in the filing. In her statement Friday, Kristina said, \"I have never harmed my children, any claims that I have are categorically false.\" \"My ex-husband, making false allegations in 2021 on social media and in court documents, was an attempt to exploit the fact that I am a public figure, using it as leverage to change the custody agreement he became dissatisfied with,\" Kristina wrote. She also said that \"media entities and my opponents are desperate, so they want to push false allegations with ZERO evidence.\" \"I love my children; I have forgiven my ex-husband and I look forward to serving the citizens of Michigan,\" she wrote. Kristina was formally nominated as the GOP's candidate for secretary of state on Saturday. She faces the Democratic incumbent Jocelyn Benson in the general election. Kristina Karamo's lawyer Dennis Zamplas, who denied the allegations in a court filing last fall, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump also did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Michigan Republican Party declined to comment. CNBC was unable to contact Adom Karamo by phone. Zamplas, in a response to Adom's motion in October, called the allegations about Kristina threatening to harm their family \"false.\" Zamplas also wrote that Adom \"went on social media\" last year, when Kristina was an announced candidate for office, \"to publicize these false allegations.\" Adom then texted Kristina \"to threaten her that if his parenting time demands were not met, he was going to take an interview with a news station to further publicize these false allegations,\" the lawyer wrote. Jezebel noted that in February, a judge granted Adom about 60 overnight stays with his daughters. Karamo was listed as a speaker at a 2021 conference associated with QAnon, a false Internet-spread conspiracy that casts Trump as a hero waging a secret battle against powerful groups of pedophiles and Satan worshippers. And she reportedly shared the false claim that the rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, disrupting Congress' confirmation of Biden's victory in the national election, were \"Antifa posing as Trump supporters.\""},

The White House's hope is that it will remain a winning strategy two months out from the midterm elections which will decide who controls the House of Representatives and Senate. The trip marks his second visit to the critical swing state of Pennsylvania in three days. \"For a long time, we've reassured ourselves that American democracy is guaranteed. But it is not,\" Biden said. \"We have to defend it. Protect it. Stand up for it. Each and every one of us. That's why tonight I'm asking our nation to come together and unite behind the single purpose of defending our democracy regardless of your ideology.\" Democrats' odds of keeping their majorities in both chambers of Congress have brightened in recent weeks despite the mixed economic signals, as Republicans continue to receive blowback from the Supreme Court's decision on abortion overturning Roe v. Wade and investigations into Trump persist. An NBC News poll released last week found a majority of American voters, 58%, disapprove of the Dobbs decision and nearly the same amount, 57%, believe the investigations into Trump should continue. \"MAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards,\" Biden said. \"Backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love.\" Since Trump entered office, Biden has said the country faces \"a battle for the soul of the nation.\" The significance of the threat to democracy is underscored by Biden's choice of venue: Independence National Historic Park where the Constitution was penned. The same NBC News poll found that \"threats to democracy\" has overtaken the cost of living as the most pressing issue on voters' minds. Biden has amped up his criticism of Republicans recently, seeking to position Democrats as an alternative to a party led by extremists. Last week he referred to Republicans as \"semi-fascist\" for staying loyal to the former president. His remarks come against the backdrop of Trump's legal woes following the FBI raid on his Florida home Mar-A-Lago where the former president is accused of mishandling classified information."},

The announcement came on the same day the Biden administration confirmed its top climate advisor Gina McCarthy is leaving in two weeks. Her deputy Ali Zaidi, who worked on climate initiatives in the Obama White House, will take over the job. Podesta, who led former President Barack Obama's climate strategy, will be tasked with doling out tax credits for clean energy products like solar panels and electric vehicles, and toward research and development in renewable energy production. More recently, Podesta served as chair of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and founded the left-leaning think tank\nThe Center for American Progress. \"We are fortunate that John Podesta will lead our continued innovation and implementation,\" the White House said in a statement. \"His deep roots in climate and clean energy policy and his experience at senior levels of government mean we can truly hit the ground running to take advantage of the massive clean energy opportunity in front of us.\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed McCarthy's Sept. 16 departure at a press briefing Friday. \"Gina is indeed leaving us,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"She, as you know, has been a leader in what we have seen as one of the largest investment in dealing with climate change.\""},

Lindsey Graham says he was stating the obvious with Trump riots claim", "paragraphs": " U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham on Saturday defended suggesting there would be \"riots in the streets\" if former President Donald Trump was prosecuted for mishandling classified information, saying he condemned the violence seen during the Capitol riot last year. \"What I tried to do was state the obvious,\" Graham, a South Carolina Republican and close ally of Trump, told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick at the Ambrosetti Forum in Italy. \"Here's what I said, The raid on [former] President Trump's home, the likely nominee for 2024, better bear some fruit here,\" he added. \"If it's just about mishandling classified information, we've had a standard set when it came to Hillary Clinton.\" \"Our country, the people on our side, believe that when it comes to the justice system, there are no rules regarding Trump, [it's a case of] 'get him, it doesn't matter how you get him,' so I said that if it's similar to what happened to Clinton and he gets prosecuted, it'll be one of the most disruptive events in America,\" Graham said. Trump and his allies have argued that the FBI, which is investigating Trump for potential violations of laws related to espionage and obstruction of justice, is treating him differently than it treated Hillary Clinton, who was the subject of an FBI investigation into her use of a private email server while secretary of state, but wasn't prosecuted. Trump's critics argue that the two cases aren't comparable. Graham said he rejected the violence seen on the Jan.6 Capitol riot and said \"all those people who defiled the Capitol should go to jail\" but said that any perceived unfairness toward Trump would have consequences. \"I don't want to pardon the January 6th people because that seems to reinforce the narrative that this is OK. I said something I really believe \u2014 if he does what she did with classified information and he gets prosecuted and she didn't it would create a problem.\" Graham said last week that there would be \"riots in the streets\" if Trump was prosecuted for mishandling classified information. \"I'll say this, if there's a prosecution of Donald Trump for mishandling classified information, after the Clinton debacle \u2026 there'll be riots in the streets,\" Graham told Fox News' Trey Gowdy, a former Republican congressman. Trump is currently under investigation and risks being indicted over his treatment of classified White House records that he took to his residence in Mar-a-Lago, Florida. Last week, the release of a heavily redacted affidavit showed how concerns about illegal activity and obstruction of justice led to an FBI search at Trump's resort in July. Graham conceded that he believed in \"handling classified information responsibly\" but again insisted that \"mishandling classified information is really bad but we can't have a system where one person gets prosecuted and the other doesn't.\" Asked whether Trump is the best person to represent the Republican Party in 2024, Graham said \"I think he could be.\" \"Whether you like Trump or not he was a consequential president ... I think a strong American president, unpredictable, is a good thing as long as you keep it within the boundaries. His problem is personal, his policies have stood the test of time but has he worn the American people out in terms of his personality? Time will tell. But I'll say this, after the Biden presidency, if there's a policy debate in 2024, I like his chances. If it's a personality contest, he'll be in trouble.\" Graham said he talks to Trump \"all the time\" and that the former president still thinks that he was \"cheated.\" Graham said he voted to certify the 2020 election and that Biden is the legitimate president. Trump \"genuinely believes that the system was rigged against him and I said 'Mr. President, I'm not trying to tell you to change your beliefs. I'm trying to tell you that you have no chance of winning in 2020 but you have a pretty good chance of winning in 2024 if you want to,'\" Graham said, noting that he told Trump that if he does make a comeback \"it will be one of the greatest political comebacks in American history.\" A federal judge on Thursday denied Graham's latest effort to challenge a subpoena for his testimony before a special grand jury in Georgia, which is investigating possible criminal election interference by Trump and his allies in 2020. However, the judge limited the scope of the subpoena by ordering that Graham could not be questioned about phone calls he made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and his staff in the weeks after the November 2020 election between Trump and President Joe Biden. It follows continued bids by Graham to avoid testifying on the grounds that his position as a lawmaker grants him immunity under the U.S. Constitution's \"speech or debate\" clause. Graham reiterated his position on Saturday, saying \"I didn't start this debate. You have a country prosecutor who has decided to investigate a national election and to call anybody and everybody connected with the role they played in the election. I'm a United States Senator, in our Constitution, we have a speech or debate immunity clause so that we can't be hauled into courts all over the country every time we do something somebody doesn't like.\" \"I think the court is going to recognize that my activities as a United States Senator was covered by the speech and debate clause that that the county prosecutor's desire to bring me down to Georgia oversteps the constitution.\""},

In the forthcoming book, \"Like, Comment, Subscribe: Inside YouTube\u2019s Chaotic Rise to World Domination,\" author Mark Bergen writes that the executive, known for being loyal to Google cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, talked about becoming Tesla's Chief Operating Officer before becoming YouTube CEO in 2014. At the time, Wojcicki had been senior vice president of ads and commerce at Google and had been looking for a higher-level role, the book said, citing those close to her. \u201cBy then, Page had begun plotting his own exit \u2014 a plan to hand Google off to a trusted deputy, Sundar Pichai,\" Bergen reports. In a conversation, Laszlo Bock, Google's HR chief at the time, said he \"suggested Page could more easily clear the way for his chosen successor by moving Wojcicki to YouTube.\u201d The announcement of Wojcicki's appointment came as a shock to many Googlers, the book says. Wojcicki had one of the earliest connections to Google -- in 1998, she famously let Page and Brin, who still hold majority shareholder voting power of Google parent company Alphabet, work from her garage when they were starting the company. Her sister, 23andMe founder Anne Wojcicki was married and had kids with Brin. In the book, Bock compared Google to a family enterprise, and the book says Wojcicki often was able to get Page's attention. \u201cWhen people couldn\u2019t get him to see reason, she always could,\u201d said former Google director and early Silicon Valley workplace influencer Kim Scott, who referred to her in the book as \u201ca Larry whisperer.\u201d One example is how Google used search data. \"Wojcicki wanted to use search queries to inform ads people saw on all those banner ads Google ran across the web; if advertisers could target consumers based on searches and on websites, they might spend gobs more with Google,\" the book says. Page had long wanted to keep search data from everything else but Wojcicki \"felt this wasn\u2019t keeping up with trends in the ad industry, which sought ever more data.\u201d \u201cThe founders trust Susan maybe more than anybody on the planet,\" Patrick Keane, an early Google sales director, said in the book. \u201cYou could never get Susan rattled, no matter how challenging the moment was.\u201d YouTube was also discussed as a potential spinout, the book reports. The year after Wojcicki\u2019s appointment, in 2015, Larry Page, announced the creation of Alphabet, a new holding company, that would separate several businesses, including self-driving car Waymo and health sciences unit Verily, from Google. \u201cYouTube seemed like a natural splinter; it already operated with a different name and office,\" the book states. \"Leaders there considered plans to become a separate Alphabet unit, detached from Google. Wojcicki wanted to keep reporting to Page, who had appointed himself Alphabet CEO, rather than his successor at Google, Sundar Pichai. But ultimately it was decided YouTube was too intertwined with Google\u2019s business and machinery to leave. So it stayed at Google.\" Under Wojcicki's watch, YouTube grew to reach more than 81% of U.S. adults and generate nearly $29 billion in revenue in 2021."},

The space agency is working toward the debut of its Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule, for what would be a more than month-long journey around the moon. As NASA was filling the rocket on Saturday morning, the agency's team detected a hydrogen fuel leak from the engine section. NASA made several attempts to fix the leak, but time ticked away ahead of the launch window that was set to open at 2:17 p.m. ET. NASA called off a first launch attempt on Monday after it was unable to resolve a temperature problem identified with one of the rocket's four liquid-fueled engines, discovered with less than two hours to go in the countdown. It was unclear whether NASA will be able to make another attempt on its next opportunities for a launch on Monday or Tuesday. If NASA decides not to try again in the coming days, the agency would likely roll the 32-story tall rocket back to the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, which would be a delay of weeks or more. The uncrewed launch is set to mark the debut of the most powerful rocket ever assembled, and kicks off NASA's long-awaited return to the moon's surface.

The comments in a \"Mad Money\" interview came after Signet reported second-quarter results earlier in the day. While earnings per share topped estimates and revenue met expectations, the company's same-store sales fell 8.2% year over year. Wall Street had been expecting a 5.3% decline, which may have contributed to the stock's 12% tumble Thursday. However, Drosos maintained an upbeat outlook for the parent firm of Zales and Kay Jewelers, suggesting near-term headwinds related to inflation do not change the long-term story. \"We had ... significant share growth last year. Tough economic times are another opportunity for us to grow share, thus our acquisition of Blue Nile, and our continued investment in the business,\" said Drosos, explaining that Signet has focused on using its scale and leaning into products like lab-created diamonds to appeal to value-seeking customers. Signet announced in early August it was buying online jewelry brand Blue Nile. While Signet has been investing in its online offerings already, Drosos said Thursday that adding Blue Nile to the fold will help Signet reach new corners of the market. \"It gives us a new consumer cohort,\" the CEO said. \"Blue Nile customers are younger, more affluent, more diverse than we have in the rest of our portfolio, so a great opportunity there.\" Sign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.

This week, pet products retailer Chewy said it's not seeing any significant trade down among shoppers in pet food. Rival pet retailer Petco made similar remarks last week, though both noted a pullback in spending on products such as leashes and toys. The comments are in line with the trend of pet owners increasingly spoiling their cats and dogs with foods that are more like the dishes they'd feed themselves or other family members. To capitalize on the ongoing shift, Petco recently partnered with snack bar maker Clif to sell a version for pets. It also launched a line of frozen, human-grade meals for dogs. \"Pet parents are driving one of the biggest trends the pet industry has seen as they increasingly seek out fresh, human-grade food for all members of the family,\" Petco CEO Ron Coughlin said in a release. Coughlin said the growing \"humanization\" of animal companions is being led by Gen Z and Millennial consumers who are \"hyper focused\" on their pets' health and wellness. In addition to more premium foods, Chewy and Petco see their health products and services as a way to better compete with the low-price offerings from retailers such as Amazon and Walmart. Earlier this month, Chewy expanded its health offerings with CarePlus, a line of pet wellness and insurance offerings. For its second quarter, Chewy said net sales rose 12.8% from a year ago to $2.43 billion as shoppers shifted toward more fresh and premium food products. Petco said its sales rose 3.2% to $1.48 billion and reported a similar shift. Still, the pet category isn't shielded from the soaring inflation that's pressuring consumers. Both Petco and Chewy reported softening demand in products such as crates, beds, leashes and toys over the summer months. Chewy noted that such items don't have to be replaced as often as some other items, and that shoppers are opting to skip on them as prices rise. Chewy said the downturn in such products is temporary and that it expects demand will recover. Brian LaRose, Petco's chief financial officer, also said orders for the products \"are delayed, not canceled.\" Still, both companies tightened their full-year guidance, in part because of the softened demand. Both companies lowered their revenue guidance for the year. Petco said it now expects adjusted earnings per share of 77 to 81 cents. It previously forecast 97 cents to $1. Petco's shares are down down around 24% year to date, while Chewy's stock is down around 41%."},

But that didn't stop the state of Mississippi from paying Favre $1.1 million in 2017 and 2018 to make motivational speeches \u2014 out of federal welfare funds intended for needy families. The Mississippi state auditor said Favre never gave the speeches and demanded the money back, with interest. Favre has repaid the fees, although not the $228,000 in interest the auditor also demanded. But the revelation by the auditor that $70 million in TANF welfare funds was doled out to a multimillionaire athlete, a professional wrestler, a horse farm and a volleyball complex are at the heart of a scandal that has rocked the nation's poorest state, sparking parallel state and federal criminal investigations that have led to charges and guilty pleas involving some of the key players. Favre hasn't been accused of a crime or charged, and he declined an interview. His lawyer, Bud Holmes, said he did nothing wrong and never understood he was paid with money intended to help poor children. Holmes acknowledged that Favre had been questioned by the FBI in the case, a fact that hasn't previously been reported. The saga, which has been boiling at low grade for 2\u00bd years, drew new attention in July, when the state welfare agency fired a lawyer who had been hired to claw back some of the money, just after he issued a subpoena seeking more information about the roles of Favre and the former governor, Phil Bryant, a Republican. The current governor, Republican Tate Reeves, acknowledged playing a role in the decision to sack Brad Pigott, accusing the former Bill Clinton-appointed U.S. attorney of having a political agenda. But the state official who first uncovered the misspending and fraud, auditor Shad White, is a Republican. In his first television interview since he was fired, Pigott said his only agenda was to get at the truth and to recoup U.S. taxpayer funds sent to Mississippi that he says were \"squandered.\" \"The notion of tens of millions of dollars that was intended by the country to go to the alleviation of poverty \u2014 and to see it going toward very different purposes \u2014 was appalling to many of us,\" he said. \"Mr. Favre was a very great quarterback, but having been a great NFL quarterback, he is not well acquainted with poverty.\" Pigott, who before he was fired sued on behalf of Mississippi's welfare agency, naming Favre and 37 other grant recipients, laid ultimate blame at the feet of top Mississippi politicians, including Bryant. \"Governor Bryant gave tens of millions of dollars of this TANF welfare money to a nonprofit led by a person who he knew well and who had more connections with his political party than with the good people in Mississippi who have the heart and the skills to actually cajole people out of poverty or prevent teenage pregnancies,\" he said. In an interview with Mississippi Today, Bryant said he never knew the grants came from welfare money. His lawyer didn't respond to requests for comment. The person in charge of the nonprofit group Pigott was referring to is Nancy New, a close friend of Bryant's wife. New and her son have pleaded guilty to state and federal charges and agreed to cooperate. New, a key player in doling out the money, said in a court document that Bryant was among those involved in directing the transactions. Her lawyer declined to comment. The former head of the state welfare agency, John Davis, has pleaded not guilty to state charges of bribery and conspiracy, and law enforcement officials say the investigations continue. Favre defended himself in a series of tweets last year against charges from state auditor White that he accepted state money for speeches he never intended to give. \"I would never knowingly take funds meant to help our neighbors in need, but for Shad White to continue to push out this lie that the money was for no-show events is something I cannot stay silent about,\" Favre tweeted. The speeches aren't the only welfare grants tied to Favre. Text messages obtained by the website Mississippi Today and authenticated by Pigott show that Favre sought a $3.2 million grant to a drug company in which he was a shareholder and a $5 million award that built a volleyball arena at the University of Southern Mississippi, where his daughter played the sport and where he played football. Favre's lawyer declined to comment. The drug company, Prevacus, was touting treatments to mitigate the effects of concussions, although none were approved by the Food and Drug Administration. In some texts, Favre suggested awarding shares in the drug company to Bryant while he was governor. \"Don't know if legal or not but we need cut him in,\" Favre texted a company official in November 2018, referring to Bryant. Following up three days later, Favre wrote, \"Also if legal I'll give some of my shares to the Governor.\" Bryant has said he never would have accepted such an offer. \"All of it remains quite a mystery,\" Pigott told NBC News, \"as to why Mr. Favre would get the benefit of millions of dollars in TANF welfare money, both for a fee for speeches he didn't make, $2 million-plus to go to a company in which he was the largest outside individual investor and $5 million for his alma mater to play volleyball in a volleyball building.\" The state auditor said he found other \"no show\" contracts benefiting former pro athletes and family members of Davis, the welfare agency director. The auditor said Davis directed one contract to Austin Smith, his nephew, who was paid more than $400,000 to provide \"coding skills\" classes even though prosecutors allege he had no such skills \"and did not know how to teach.\" At least $3 million went to Ted DiBiase, a retired professional wrestler. Marcus Dupree, a former college football star, also received $370,000 in welfare funds, which prosecutors say partly went to fund his horse ranch. Paul LaCoste, who is the current governor's athletic trainer, was paid $300,000 in welfare funds to run a fitness boot camp for legislators. DiBiase, Dupree, LaCoste and Smith didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. The scandal has also spotlighted the meager scope of Mississippi's welfare program and provided a stark reminder of the Clinton-era welfare reform that provided states with block grants and wide latitude in how they spend it. According to state figures, Mississippi rejects more than 90% of those who apply for the federal welfare benefit known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF. This year 2,500 children received benefits, state officials said, in a state with 192,000 poor children. One of those who had trouble getting help was Tamara Edwards, who raised four children on her own while working a series of low-wage jobs. She once received welfare vouchers for child care, and in 2009 she applied again, she said. Even though her income was low enough, she was denied. \"They told me they didn't have the funds,\" said Edwards, who now works as a cook at a Cracker Barrel restaurant. Advocates and state legislators say Mississippi's welfare agency, under years of conservative Republican state governments, has a history of questionable spending and a lack of transparency. \"TANF has been a slush fund for a long time,\" said Oleta Fitzgerald, who is the director of the Children's Defense Fund's Southern Regional Office and is based in Jackson, the state capital. \"Mississippi is the poorest doggone state in the country \u2014 where is the money, and what are they doing with it? There is nobody on welfare \u2014 welfare participation rates are way down \u2014 and no one knows where that money is being spent.\" Aisha Nyandoro, the chief executive of Springboard to Opportunities, a local nonprofit group that works with residents of affordable housing, said: \"And DHS [the state Department of Human Services] will tell you that the reason that they cannot go about allocating the TANF funds is because they can't find any families who are eligible. Go outside and throw a rock. It's Mississippi. You can find an eligible family.\" Jarvis Dortsch, a former state legislator who heads the state's chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said that when he was a member of the Legislature, \"I could not get a list of how the money was being spent.\" Dortsch said he had to resort to secrecy. \"Someone had snuck me a list \u2014 it didn't have [a] DHS [logo] on it \u2014 they had it printed out and snuck it out,\" he said. Shad White, the auditor, told NBC News the investigation goes on. \"My office is continuing the work we started over two years ago on what is now the largest public fraud case in our state's history,\" he said. \"We will also continue to work with our state and federal partners to be sure each person responsible for this massive scheme is held fully accountable under the law.\""},

Investors are looking for clues as to just how aggressive the Federal Reserve could be later this month, when the central bank is widely expected to raise rates again in its fight against inflation. The economy added 315,000 jobs last month. Economists were projecting an increase of 318,000, according to Dow Jones. Starbucks has chosen its next chief executive officer: Laxman Narasimhan, who just resigned as CEO of Reckitt, which owns Lysol cleaning brands, Durex condoms and more. Yet Howard Schultz, who has been the coffee chain's interim CEO since April, isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Narasimhan will join Starbucks in October, but won't take over as the company's chief until April. Schultz will also remain on the company's board and continue to be an advisor after Narasimhan, also a PepsiCo veteran, assumes the role. More details are on the way at Starbucks' investor day, which is slated for Sept. 13 in Seattle. The National Labor Relations Board said Thursday that the Amazon Labor Union's winning effort to unionize a Staten Island, New York, warehouse should be upheld. The e-commerce giant began its formal objection in May, the month after the union won. But the NLRB attorney overseeing the case said Amazon\"had not met its burden\" in its bid to demonstrate that the union used objectionable means to secure its victory. The grassroots Amazon Labor Union, meanwhile, is looking to expand its influence. It failed to unionize another Staten Island warehouse in May, but workers at warehouses in Albany, New York, and Kentucky are seeking to organize with the union. After hours of delays due to shelling in the region Thursday, inspectors with the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency finally made it to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine.

During an interview at the Ambrosetti Forum in Italy it was put to Starace that, in some people's view, oil and gas would be key for energy over the next 25 years, a contention he disputed. \"I totally disagree, because this is a view that is coming from, say, 15 years ago,\" he said. \"Was that wrong at that time? No, it was not. Now it's wrong.\" \"The economy can work much better, relying much less on fossil fuels, than people think,\" he went on to add. \"It will take maybe another two years before everybody understands that \u2014 but we are there.\" Despite this optimism about the future, today's reality on the ground is hugely challenging. The current situation in Europe, where many countries are attempting to wean themselves off Russian energy following the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine, illustrates the crucial role fossil fuels still play in society. With colder months closing in, European nations have been looking to shore up gas storage in a bid to ensure security of supply. Looking ahead, Enel's Starace expressed confidence Europe had prepared for the coming winter. \"Insofar as storage is concerned, Europe \u2026 did the right thing,\" he said, noting that most countries were \"pretty full.\" \"Now, the question is what happens if gas is cut altogether from Russia,\" Starace went on to state. \"Well, we're almost there, the cut is actually almost there.\" \"We have a view, and there are many studies showing that with some sacrifices, [such as] two notches of temperature down, and a little bit of attention to gas consumptions \u2026 Europe can make it through the wintertime.\" \"The question is when we get to the spring [of] 2023 with totally depleted, really, reserves, and gas is still not flowing,\" he said. \"Is Europe able to re-establish the storage, with all the backup of floating regasifiers and energy coming from other parts of the world? I think that's going to be the big challenge.\" The Enel Group \u2014 whose main shareholder is the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance \u2014 has said it will abandon gas generation by 2040. It also plans to leave the retail gas market in 2040. Starace's comments came on the same day that the EU's climate chief, Frans Timmermans, hammered home the urgency of the situation facing European economies in the face of rising energy prices and concerns about supply. \"We need to do everything we can to face this energy crisis and to make sure that we do everything we can to reduce the prices so that our citizens can still afford to heat their homes this winter,\" Timmermans, who was speaking to CNBC's Silvia Amaro at an event in Bali, Indonesia, said. He also stressed the importance of member states being \"in a position to address the issue of windfall profits, if necessary.\" \"So we'll try everything to make sure that our energy markets are functioning, and are functioning in a way that addresses the issues that we need to tackle.\" Timmermans was asked if \"doing everything\" meant the EU agreeing, in the short term, to imposing caps on the price of gas and electricity. \"Well, nothing's off the table right now,\" he replied. \"We're preparing all of that, but we have to make sure that what we do doesn't create more damage than it helps us address the issue.\" \"So we have to be extremely careful. It took us 30 years to build the energy markets, so we need to make sure we address today's issue without creating long term problems.\""},

Already reeling from an economic crisis, flood waters have submerged over one third of the country in water, killing over 1,000 and impacting 33 million people. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the country's foreign minister, told CNBC's Dan Murphy Thursday that he fears the damages from the natural disaster will exceed current estimates of $10 billion, adding that the crisis in the country is still ongoing and in the \"rescue and relief phase.\" The flooding, which Bhutto Zardari told CNBC is \"a climate disaster of biblical proportions,\" covers over 95,000 square miles of land. Bhutto Zardari said the crisis is far from over, as \"southern areas of Pakistan are still bracing themselves for the flooding to come through the rivers from the north.\" \"Pakistan at this point in time, are paying in their lives and in their livelihoods for a climate disaster that is not of their making,\" he said. Pakistan's contribution to global carbon emissions is less than 1%, but it's among the 10 most affected countries in the world by climate change. The South Asian nation of over 220 million people reported a 27% inflation rate for August, according to government data, and was hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. Its currency has tanked while net foreign reserves have dwindled to just $8 billion in August, according to the State Bank of Pakistan. Political infighting has gripped the country since April, after the ousting of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who has been charged under anti-terror laws by Pakistan's police. Rural areas in Pakistan have been hit the hardest by flooding, which will have a compounded impact on Pakistan's farming industry, and ultimately the cost of food. Bhutto Zardari told CNBC \"about 80 to 90%\" of Pakistan's crops have been damaged by the floods. The International Rescue Committee report that 4 million acres of crops have been destroyed with 800,000 livestock perishing. Prior to the disaster, food inflation in rural provinces was much higher compared to urban areas. For instance, the cost of onions in Pakistan's urban areas increased by 89% from July 2021 to July 2022. In rural areas, that cost increase topped 100%. The International Monetary Fund on Monday approved the release of $1.1 billion to Pakistan in special drawing rights, a part of its bailout program which began in 2019. The money was already part of a relief program to help Pakistan stabilize its economy. Pakistan has now launched a joint appeal with the United Nations for about $160 million, which Bhutto Zardari told CNBC \"is obviously a very conservative estimate about the bare minimum requirements at this moment.\" Over a million homes have been destroyed, and Bhutto Zardari added that key infrastructure like bridges, road networks, and dams have been damaged. Pakistan going forward, he says, will need \"large scale reconstruction, which will require a lot of work.\""},

Lindsey Graham bid to quash subpoena in Trump Georgia election probe, but puts limit on questions", "paragraphs": " A federal judge on Thursday denied Sen. Lindsey Graham's latest effort to fully quash a subpoena for his testimony before a special grand jury in Georgia as part of its probe into possible criminal election interference by former President Donald Trump and his allies in 2020. But the judge also limited the scope of the subpoena by ordering that Graham, a South Carolina Republican and close Trump ally, cannot be asked about his \"investigatory fact-finding on telephone calls to Georgia election officials\" during his testimony. She was referring to phone calls Graham made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and his staff in the weeks after the November 2020 election between Trump and President Joe Biden. Graham's lawyers have argued that those calls were \"quintessentially legislative factfinding\" by a sitting U.S. senator, and as such are protected by the speech and debate clause of the Constitution. That off-limits topic includes how the information he gathered \"related to his decision to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election,\" the judge ruled. \"The Court finds that this area of inquiry falls under the protection of the Speech or Debate Clause, which prohibits questions on legislative activity,\" Judge Leigh Martin May wrote in Thursday's order in U.S. District Court in Atlanta. But May rejected Graham's other arguments to either throw out the subpoena or sharply limit the questions that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' office can ask him. \"As to the other categories, the Court finds that they are not legislative, and the Speech or Debate Clause does not apply to them,\" May wrote. \"As such, Senator Graham may be questioned about any alleged efforts to encourage Secretary Raffensperger or others to throw out ballots or otherwise alter Georgia's election practices and procedures,\" the judge ordered. \"Likewise, the grand jury may inquire into Senator Graham's alleged communications and coordination with the Trump Campaign and its post-election efforts in Georgia, as well as into Senator Graham's public statements related to Georgia's 2020 elections,\" May wrote. Graham's challenge now goes back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, where the senator filed an appeal after a previous ruling from Judge May denying his bid to quash the subpoena. \"We are pleased that the district court recognized that Senator Graham's testimony is protected by the Speech or Debate Clause,\" Graham's office said in a statement later Thursday. \"He will continue to defend the institutional interests of the Senate and the Constitution before the Eleventh Circuit.\" The order for Graham's testimony in Georgia's probe came one day after John Eastman, a pro-Trump lawyer who worked to overturn Biden's presidential victory, appeared before the grand jury and refused to answer questions. Eastman invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, as well as protections under attorney-client privilege, in refusing to answer at least some questions he was asked before the grand jury, his attorneys said. Rudy Giuliani, Trump's former personal attorney who was a leading voice challenging the 2020 election results, also recently testified before the grand jury."},

Speaking to CNBC at the Ambrosetti Forum in Italy, Ferguson said the catalyst events had already occurred to spark a repeat of the 70s, a period characterized by financial shocks, political clashes and civil unrest. Yet this time, the severity of those shocks was likely to be greater and more sustained. \"The ingredients of the 1970s are already in place,\" Ferguson, Milbank Family Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick. \"The monetary and fiscal policy mistakes of last year, which set this inflation off, are very alike to the 60s,\" he said, likening recent price hikes to the 1970's doggedly high inflation. \"And, as in 1973, you get a war,\" he continued, referring to the 1973 Arab-Israeli War \u2014 also known as the Yom Kippur War \u2014 between Israel and a coalition of Arab states led by Egypt and Syria. As with Russia's current war in Ukraine, the 1973 Arab-Israeli War led to international involvement from then-superpowers the Soviet Union and the U.S., sparking a wider energy crisis. Only that time, the conflict lasted just 20 days. Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has now entered into its sixth month, suggesting that any repercussions for energy markets could be far worse. \"This war is lasting much longer than the 1973 war, so the energy shock it is causing is actually going to be more sustained,\" said Ferguson. Politicians and central bankers have been vying to mitigate the worst effects of the fallout, by raising interest rates to combat inflation and reducing reliance on Russian energy imports. But Ferguson, who has authored 16 books, including his most recent \"Doom: The Politics of Catastrophe,\" said there was no evidence to suggest that current crises could be avoided. \"Why shouldn't it be as bad as the 1970s?\" he said. \"I'm going to go out on a limb: Let's consider the possibility that the 2020s could actually be worse than the 1970s.\" Among the reasons for that, he said, were currently lower productivity growth, higher debt levels and less favorable demographics now versus 50 years ago. \"At least in the 1970s you had detente between superpowers. I don't see much detente between Washington and Beijing right now. In fact, I see the opposite,\" he said, referring to recent clashes over Taiwan. Humans like to believe that global shocks happen with some degree of order or predictability. But that, Ferguson said, is a fallacy. In fact, rather than being evenly spread throughout history, like a bell curve, disasters tend to happen non-linearly and all at once, he said. \"The distributions in history really aren't normal, particularly when it comes to things like wars and financial crises or, for that matter, pandemics,\" said Ferguson. \"You start with a plague \u2014 or something we don't see very often, a really large global pandemic \u2014 which kills millions of people and disrupts the economy in all kinds of ways. Then you hit it with a big monetary and fiscal policy shock. And then you add the geopolitical shock.\" That miscalculation leads humans to be overly optimistic and, ultimately, unprepared to handle major crises, he said. \"In their heads, the world is kind of a bunch of averages, and there aren't likely to be really bad outcomes. This leads people ... to be somewhat overoptimistic,\" he said. As an example, Ferguson said he surveyed attendees at Ambrosetti \u2014 a forum in Italy attended by political leaders and the business elite \u2014 and found low single-digit percentages expect to see a decline in investment in Italy over the coming months. \"This is a country that's heading towards a recession,\" he said."},

It represents yet another example of beverage companies blurring the lines between drink categories, seeking to leverage existing brand loyalty while entering fast-growing categories. Gatorade's parent company, PepsiCo, has already expanded Mountain Dew into alcoholic and energy drinks. The company says Fast Twitch is designed to give athletes an extra boost before their workouts. The market for preworkout powders is growing, fueled by industry leaders such as Cellucor C4 and RSP Nutrition. But few preworkout drinks exist, and many consumers instead turn to carbonated, sugary energy drinks. Anuj Bhasin, general manager of Gatorade, said roughly 32 million consumers reject the energy drink category for the negative health effects. Fast Twitch aims to attract those consumers, offering plenty of caffeine but no sugar or carbonation. The new drink is slated to launch in February, but NFL players will be drinking it on sidelines during the upcoming season as part of an exclusive deal with the league. Bhasin said Gatorade worked with the NFL and its sports performance experts to develop the specific formula. The finished product comes in a petite 12-ounce bottle with brightly colored packaging. While smaller, it tastes pretty similar to traditional Gatorade. A bottle of Fast Twitch contains electrolytes, B-vitamins and 200 milligrams of caffeine. For comparison, a 12-ounce can of Red Bull has nearly half as much caffeine but 37 grams of sugar. Bolt24, another recent offshoot of Gatorade, has just 75 milligrams of caffeine in its Energize line, which is being phased out. \"Two hundred milligrams is the right amount to help athletes seeking benefits for exercise performance,\" said Matthew Pahnke, senior principal scientist at the Gatorade Sports Science Institute. Since its creation nearly six decades ago, Gatorade has built its brand on hydration, spreading the word about the benefits of electrolytes and carbohydrates. But caffeine is a natural diuretic, removing salt and water from the body. As a result, Fast Twitch is meant to precede drinking a more hydrating beverage during an actual workout, the company says. \"We know athletes will mix and match things,\" Pahnke said. Fast Twitch will target consumers who are 18 years old or older due to the high caffeine content, according to Bhasin. Fast Twitch follows a broader push by Pepsi into energy drinks. Over the last three years, the company bought Rockstar Energy for $3.85 billion, launched Mtn Dew Rise Energy with the endorsement of NBA superstar Lebron James and acquired a minority stake in up-and-coming energy drink maker Celsius for $550 million. Celsius is a potential competitor for Fast Twitch. The upstart markets its beverages as \"fitness drinks,\" and its marketing shows models swinging kettle bells and stretching. Another challenger also has ties to Gatorade's parent company. Bang Energy, which recently ended an acrimonious distribution deal with Pepsi, markets itself as a preworkout or recovery drink. Beyond being highly caffeinated, it touts \"super creatine,\" which claims to boost muscle performance, but no sugar. But Pepsi is already the dominant leader in the U.S. sports drink category, holding 73.2% market share with Gatorade and G Zero, according to Euromonitor International data. Bodyarmor jumped to second place in 2021 with 11.7% market share, overtaking Coca-Cola 's Powerade. Coke purchased full control of Bodyarmor in November for $5.6 billion in a play to increase its market share. Changing consumer tastes led to slowing sales growth for the sports drink market, even as U.S. adults exercise more. Years of backlash from lawmakers and pediatricians about sports drinks' high sugar and calorie counts didn't help either. But Gatorade staged a comeback, focusing on options with more electrolytes and less sugar, such as recent spin-offs G Fit, Gatorlyte and Bolt24. In the second quarter, Pepsi reported double-digit revenue growth for the Gatorade brand. However, not all of Gatorade's innovations have paid off. An organic version of the drink released in 2016 failed to take off and was discontinued several years later. Energy represents an opportunity in a fast-growing segment, but it lacks trust from consumers who exercise. Gatorade, on the other hand, has earned plenty of trust from that customer base. \"We found this to be the sweet spot of bringing a new brand to market, with the distinction of being from the makers of Gatorade, much like Propel,\" Bhasin said."},

The company also raised its outlook for the year. Shares rose about 9% in off-hours trading. Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv: Same store sales grew 23%, which beat StreetAccount's estimate of 17.6%. Net sales rose 29% to $1.87 billion. The company said that traffic remains strong both in stores and online, even as surging inflation cramps consumers' spending. Lululemon has a higher-income customer base that seems mostly unfettered by inflationary pressures. Still, other higher-end retailers like Nordstrom and Macy's slashed their outlook this quarter on fears of slowing demand. Lululemon, on the other hand, has boosted its guidance in two consecutive quarters. \"Despite the challenges around us in the macro-environment, guest traffic in our stores and on our e-commerce sites remains robust, which speaks to the strength of our multi-dimensional operating model,\" Chief Financial Officer Meghan Frank said in a news release. Store traffic increased over 30%, and ecommerce traffic rose over 40%, executives said on the earnings call Thursday. The company is hoping to boost customer loyalty with a soon-to-launch membership program. The membership program was announced at the end of the first quarter. It has a free tier and a $39 per month paid tier which give subscribers early access to product drops and exclusive items, as well as invitations to in-person events. The company said the traffic increases were not attributable to promotional programs or product markdowns. \"We have not changed our promotional cadence,\" CEO Calvin McDonald said on the earnings call. \"We have no plans to do so.\" Lululemon continued brick-and-mortar expansion during the quarter, with 21 net new stores for a total of 600 locations. Inventories were up 85% to $1.5 billion compared to the same period last year, but the company said it was \"under-inventoried\" at the time due to supply chain bottlenecks. Retailers in general have had to contend with swelling inventory levels as shoppers adjust their spending habits. Lululemon said Thursday it is confident the inventory level will help it boost sales during the holiday shopping season. The company said it now expects 2022 revenue of between $7.865 billion and $7.940 billion, up from the range of $7.610 billion to $7.710 billion it stated last quarter. The company also raised its adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $9.75 to $9.90, from last quarter's guidance of $9.35 to $9.50 adjusted. The release also maintained the company's long-term outlook of doubling net revenue to $12.5 billion from from 2021 to 2026. The plan includes an expansion of its menswear business, footwear, and membership-based fitness classes. Upon the plan's announcement in the spring, some analysts were skeptical about Lululemon's ability to achieve the lofty longer-term target. Lululemon touted some early success with the plan. It launched new shoes during the quarter, while its men's business saw 27% growth. The company also reported growth across all of the countries in which stores are currently active.

The city's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection said the case marks its first lawsuit for a violation of New York City's \"just cause\" protections for fast-food workers. Austin Locke, a longtime barista and union organizer, was fired less than a month after he and his coworkers voted to unionize a Starbucks in Queens, according to the lawsuit. The store is one of dozens of Starbucks locations that have voted to unionize. Starbucks had said that Locke was fired for failing to fill out a Covid-19 questionnaire and falsely reporting that a supervisor made physical contact with him, according to the city's lawsuit. The missteps were reportedly confirmed by surveillance footage, but the suit states that Locke's district and store manager did not let him see that footage. Locke's shifts were canceled, and he filed a complaint to the city days later. \"We do not comment on pending litigation,\" a Starbucks representative wrote to CNBC. \"However, we do intend to defend against the alleged violations of the New York City Just Cause Law.\" Under the city's Fair Workweek law, it is illegal to fire workers who have completed a 30 day probation or reduce their hours by more than 15% without just cause or an economic justification. The city is suing to get Locke reinstated and to win him restitution and back pay, which the city says will continue to accrue until Locke returns to his job. \"It's been a year since the campaign with Starbucks Workers United began at a Starbucks in Buffalo, NY,\" said Austin Locke in a statement released by the city. \"There are now 235 unionized Starbucks around the country. Starbucks continues to wrongfully fire pro-union workers nationwide in retaliation for union organizing.\" Starbucks has seen a wave of stores unionize across the country, and organizers have brought claims of retaliation by the company. Howard Schultz returned to the company as interim CEO amid the labor push, and has said he wants to reinvent the employee, customer and store experience to better reflect how the world has changed since the pandemic.

The fast-food giant ended the offering during the early days of pandemic lockdowns as part of a broader scheme to simplify service. Bloated menus can overwhelm customers, slow down kitchen operations and lead to longer drive-thru lines. Many U.S. franchisees cheered the decision, but customers have been asking the company's Twitter account about when all-day breakfast will return. A Twitter user revived the conversation on Thursday, tweeting a screenshot of a McDonald's press release that said all-day breakfast would be served starting Oct. 6. But bad news for Egg McMuffin lovers: a McDonald's representative confirmed that the release is from 2015, when the chain created its all-day breakfast menu. Former CEO Steve Easterbrook launched the menu as part of a turnaround plan to revitalize the burger chain's sluggish sales, and the company credited the move for driving sales growth. But it looks unlikely that the all-day breakfast menu will return. Even before the pandemic, operators had been asking the company to whittle down all-day breakfast items to speed up service. As McDonald's management began looking to add menu items back after lockdowns ended, CEO Chris Kempczinski told analysts that his team was working with franchisees to make sure \"every item that we add earns its way back onto the menu.\" With franchisee relations at a low point now over disagreements to new ownership terms, bringing back all-day breakfast could further fuel tensions."},

Narasimhan will join the company in October before stepping into the top job in April, Starbucks announced late Thursday. He will succeed interim CEO Howard Schultz, who returned to the coffee giant for his third stint earlier this year. Schultz will stay on as an advisor and remain on the board. BTIG analyst Peter Saleh compared the structure to a co-CEO model in a note to clients. Now, all eyes are on Starbucks' investor day in Seattle on Sept. 13. \"Importantly, this hire removes a major overhang for [Starbucks] shares, with focus now shifting to the '22 Investor Day,\" Barclays analyst Jeffrey Bernstein wrote. The company is expected to unveil a reinvention plan that will bring bold changes to the chain and its cafes. Schultz has crafted the strategy and will remain heavily involved with its implementation. Previous Schultz departures have resulted in double-digit tumbles for Starbucks stock. When the company announced in late 2016 that then-Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson would replace Schultz, shares fell as much as 10% in extended trading. Johnson was a relative newcomer to the restaurant industry, joining Starbucks as COO after decades working in tech. But Wall Street doesn't seem very concerned about Starbucks' latest transition plan. When the company announced its incoming CEO Thursday evening, the stock fell less than 1% in extended trading. In a demonstration of investors' trust in Narasimhan, shares of his current employer, Lysol and Durex owner Reckitt, fell as much as 5.7% on Thursday after the surprise announcement of his departure later this month. \"Narasimhan joins from Reckitt where he has overseen a successful restructuring, likely invaluable experience for the reinvention Schultz clearly envisages for [Starbucks],\" Atlantic Equities analyst Edward Lewis said in a Friday note. Analysts focused on Narasimhan's global experience, which could strengthen Starbucks' sales in emerging markets. His previous roles included serving as head of PepsiCo's Latin America, Europe and sub-Saharan Africa operations. Narasimhan \"brings the right kind of fresh perspective, leadership capabilities and energy\" to take Starbucks to the next level, Jefferies analyst Andy Barish wrote."},

He'll join Starbucks in October, learning about the company and its reinvention plan, before assuming the top job in April. Until then, Howard Schultz will continue as interim CEO of the coffee chain he grew into a global giant. Schultz will remain on Starbucks' board after Narasimhan succeeds him. Schultz has been at the helm since April, when his handpicked successor Kevin Johnson retired after five years on the job. Schultz returned to the company as its interim CEO, earning just $1 for his salary. In the meantime, Schultz and the Starbucks board hunted for a long-term successor, with the intention of announcing the new CEO in the fall. (The coffee chain brought back the Pumpkin Spice Latte and other fall menu items on Tuesday.) Schultz has previously said that he wants to reinvent the employee, customer and store experience to reckon with how the world has changed since the pandemic. The company is holding an investor day on Sept. 13 in Seattle, where it's expected to unveil more details about the bold changes it plans to make. Starbucks said in a news release that Schultz will remain \"closely involved\" with the plan and act as an advisor to Narasimhan. Narasimhan previously worked at PepsiCo, serving as its global chief commercial officer among other roles. Prior to working at the food and beverage giant, he was a senior partner at McKinsey. As CEO, he'll have to tackle a number of challenges. In its home market, Starbucks is facing a union push, with more than 200 stores in the U.S. voting to organize under Workers United. The battle has resulted in negative headlines and legal battles. Inflation hasn't hurt sales yet, but it has pushed menu prices higher. And China, its second-largest market, is struggling to bounce back from the pandemic, hampered by the country's zero Covid policy. \"His deep, hands-on experience driving strategic transformations at global consumer-facing businesses makes him the ideal choice to accelerate Starbucks growth and capture the opportunities ahead of us,\" Starbucks board chair Mellody Hobson said in a statement."},

All of Buick's roughly 2,000 U.S. franchise dealers will be given the opportunity to take a buyout, Duncan Aldred, global head of Buick, told The Wall Street Journal. \"Not everyone necessarily wants to make that journey, depending on where they're located or the level of expenditure that the transition will demand,\" he told the publication. \"So if they want to exit the Buick franchise, then we will give them monetary assistance to do so.\" Michelle Malcho, a company spokeswoman, on Friday confirmed the buyout plans to CNBC but declined to disclose the expected cost or how many dealers GM anticipates will take the offer. Many Buick dealers also sell GMC vehicles or another one of GM's U.S. brands. The company offered similar buyouts to Cadillac dealers in 2020. About 320 of those 880 retailers accepted the offer rather than assume expectations to invest at least $200,000 toward upgrading dealerships for electric vehicles. Buyout offers for Cadillac dealers ranged from about $300,000 to more than $1 million, a person familiar with the plans previously told CNBC.

The average home sold for less than its list price for the first time in over 17 months during the four-week period ended Aug. 28, according to a report by Redfin. Homes are simply not selling at the breakneck pace they were six months ago, when strong demand butted up against tight supply, bidding wars were the norm, and a seller could often get a signed contract in under a weekend. Homes in August sat on the market an average five days longer than they did a year ago \u2014 the first annual increase in time on the market in more than two years.

But Comcast executives are planning on Disney buying them out \u2014 even if they'd prefer otherwise. Disney owns two-thirds of Hulu and has an option to buy the remaining 33% from Comcast as early as January 2024. Some analysts and industry watchers have speculated Comcast might try to buy Hulu from Disney rather than the other way around. Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts has been a long-time believer in Hulu and has historically pushed to keep the asset rather than sell, including in 2013, when Roberts nixed talks with DirecTV, according to people familiar with the matter. Comcast broached the idea of buying all of Hulu from Disney after Disney agreed to acquire the majority of Fox's assets as part of a $71 billion deal that closed in early 2019, said two of the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private. Disney, armed with 66% ownership after acquiring Fox's minority stake in Hulu, dismissed the idea, the people said. Blocked from buying all of Hulu, Comcast's sustained belief in the business led to the unusual agreement the two companies reached in May 2019, with Comcast agreeing to sell Disney its minority stake as early as 2024. As part of that transaction, Disney guaranteed a sale price valuing Hulu at a minimum of $27.5 billion. That amount spiked earlier in the pandemic, giving Comcast some hope that Disney may choose to unload Hulu rather than pay Comcast a huge check for the remainder, two of the people said. Offloading Hulu would have allowed Disney to put its focus and money primarily on Disney+. \"I think if Disney could roll back the clock today, I'm not so sure they would enter into that deal,\" said Neil Begley, an analyst for Moody's Investors Services. \"Disney has this huge bill to pay in 2024 at a time when they're already investing a lot of money into Disney+.\" Acquiring Hulu from Disney would also supercharge Comcast's streaming efforts. Hulu would instantly become Comcast's flagship streaming asset, replacing NBCUniversal's Peacock, which has added just 13 million paid subscribers in its nearly two years of existence. Hulu has 46.2 million subscribers. Peacock could live on as NBCUniversal's free advertising-supported option. Peacock already has a free tier, with millions of users. Several top Comcast executives also think Hulu doesn't make as much sense paired with Disney's assets as it would at NBCUniversal, especially with the recent announcement that Disney+ plans to launch an advertising-supported tier in December, according to people familiar with the matter. Hulu has been Disney's advertising-supported service for years. Disney could have positioned Hulu as its advertising play going forward, but CEO Bob Chapek has chosen to make versions of both Disney+ and Hulu with and without commercials. Spokespeople for Disney and Comcast declined to comment. Netflix's slowing growth this year has led to an overall devaluation in the streaming sector. Comcast executives value Hulu \"significantly higher\" than $27.5 billion, and possibly up to $50 billion, one of the people said. That's down from around $60 billion during the pandemic, the person said. If Disney sticks to its plan to buy out Comcast by January 2024, there's still time for significant valuation fluctuations. Disney's decision to lower Disney+'s 2024 guidance and its subsequent move to raise prices signaled to Wall Street that Chapek is no longer focused on adding subscribers at all costs. It's sent a signal to Comcast that Hulu is likely in Disney's long-term plans. Excluding Hulu with Live TV, Hulu's average revenue per user is $12.92 per month. That's nearly triple Disney+'s global ARPU of $4.35 and more than double Disney+'s ARPU in the U.S. and Canada ($6.27). Disney has built a streaming strategy around bundling Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+. While Disney raised Disney+'s price by 38% and ESPN+'s price by 43%, it only bumped its bundled offering of Disney+, Hulu (with ads) and ESPN+ by $1, from $13.99 to $14.99. That suggests Disney's most preferred option is customers pay for the entire bundle, including Hulu. Media and entertainment companies have begun focusing on building profitable subscribers, rather than simply acquiring subscribers, in recent months as industrywide streaming growth has slowed. If Disney isn't trading on Disney+ growth, Hulu becomes a more important part of its long-term strategy. \"People are getting more judicious about their spend,\" Kevin Mayer, Disney's former head of streaming, said on CNBC last month. \"There's a renewed emphasis from Wall Street not just on the topline subscriber number but on the bottom line. I think that's healthy.\" There's also the issue of competitive dynamics. A primary reason Disney held on to Hulu, and acquired other Fox assets, was specifically to keep them from Comcast, according to people familiar with the matter. Handing Hulu to Comcast would alter the balance of power in the media world and weaken Disney, then-CEO Bob Iger thought, the people said. Comcast has already taken steps to weaken Hulu, assuming Disney will keep it. Earlier this year, Comcast made the decision to remove content such as \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Voice\" from the streaming service and put it on Peacock instead. That change takes place later this month. Comcast has already earmarked some of the proceeds it'll receive toward paying down debt. Comcast executives say they don't need the cash and aren't independently looking to accelerate a timeline, two of the people said. Activist investor Dan Loeb's Third Point Capital bought a new stake in Disney last month, arguing Disney should not only complete its deal for Hulu, it should accelerate its timing. \"We urge the company to make every attempt to acquire Comcast's remaining minority stake prior to the contractual deadline in early 2024,\" Loeb said in a letter addressed to Chapek. \"We believe that it would even be prudent for Disney to pay a modest premium to accelerate the integration but are cognizant that the seller may have an unreasonable price expectation at this time (while noting the seller has already made the decision to prematurely remove their own content from the platform.) We know this is a priority for you and hope there is a deal to be had before Comcast is contractually obligated to do so in about 18 months.\" Disney hasn't publicly addressed the specifics of Loeb's requests and hasn't made a decision on whether it plans to speed up a timeline to buy Comcast's stake in Hulu, according to people familiar with the matter.

The food and beverage company filed in November to go public on the Nasdaq Exchange using the ticker \"CHO.\" Reuters reported the yogurt maker was seeking a valuation of more than $10 billion. But it's been a rocky year for the stock market, leading to a drought of IPOs. In the second quarter, there were just 41 initial public offerings in the Americas, down 73% from the year-earlier period, according to a recent EY report. Chobani joins payroll vendor Justworks, grocer Fresh Market and file-sharing company WeTransfer in canceling its IPO this year. In an emailed statement, Chobani cited current market conditions for the withdrawal. \"Our focus remains on strong execution and driving profitable growth, and we continue to be excited about the future of Chobani,\" the statement said. In recent years, Chobani has expanded its product portfolio beyond Greek yogurt, adding oat milk, coffee creamers, cold brew coffee and yogurt drinks to its roster. In its IPO filing, the company said its revenue grew 5.2% to $1.4 billion from 2019 to 2020. However, its net loss more than tripled during that time, reaching $58.7 million, as it invested back into its business. Chobani said it planned to use a portion of the proceeds from the IPO to pay down debt. The company also said it would reorganize its corporate structure as part of the process. In March, amid delays to its IPO, Chobani' s then-operating chief Peter McGuinness left for Impossible Foods, where he now serves as chief executive. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in a statement that the departures of top leaders like McGuinness have cast a shadow over Chobani, despite its strong sales growth. \"This has given the impression of serious disagreements at the top which is not exactly the message a business looking to go public wants to impart,\" he said."},

The G-7 economic powers announced Friday that they had agreed on a plan to impose a set price on Russian oil. The initiative is the latest attempt to apply economic pressure on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. But aside from cutting Russia's oil revenues \u2014 a key source of funding for President Vladimir Putin's war chest \u2014 Le Maire said the policy should be implemented as a \"global measure against war.\" \"You need an outreach because we don't want this measure to be only a Western measure,\" Le Maire told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick at the Ambrosetti Forum in Italy. \"It should not be a Western measure against Russia, it should be a global measure against war,\" he added. The G-7 \u2014 which consists of the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, the U.K., Italy and Japan \u2014 is yet to finalize how the price cap will be implemented, a process that Le Maire acknowledged will be \"quite difficult.\" However, it is expected to be ready before early December when EU sanctions on seaborne imports of Russian crude kick in. \"We know that we need the unity from all the 27 member states if you want to get the green light for introducing that cap,\" he said, referring to the EU bloc of nations, a non-enumerated member of the G-7. More than that, however, Le Maire said the policy would require participation by other major global economies. It follows comments from Kadri Simson, the EU's energy chief, who urged involvement from China and India, both of which have increased their purchases of Russian oil this year, benefiting from discounted rates. \"If we want to be efficient in these sanctions, we need to reduce the revenues that Russia is gaining from oil and gas selling,\" Le Maire said. Russia has previously said it will not sell oil to nations that impose a price limit. And following the G-7's announcement on Friday, Russia's state-owned energy giant Gazprom said it would not restart gas flows via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline due to technical issues. It came after gas supplies were already halted last week for a planned \"maintenance outage\" that was expected to last until Sept. 3. Paolo Gentiloni, the EU's economics commissioner, said Saturday that the bloc was \"ready to react\" to Russia's decision to stop gas supplies to the region. France's Le Maire said separately that Europe's steadfast opposition to Russia, namely via economic sanctions and international diplomacy, was evidence of the region's rising status as a \"third global superpower.\" \"Things are radically changing. Europe is becoming a superpower, not only from an economic point of view but also a political point of view,\" Le Maire said. \"I really think that we are moving on the right direction to have Europe playing a part in the 21 st century between China and the United States,\" he added."},

Bartiromo, the anchor of Fox programs \"Mornings with Maria\" and \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" is slated to appear for a deposition on Sept. 8, according to court filings. In recent days, Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson and Jeanine Pirro were among the network hosts scheduled to appear for questioning in Dominion's lawsuit, which is seeking $1.6 billion in damages from the cable news network. Dominion has argued that Fox Corp. 's Fox News and Fox Business made false claims that its voting machines rigged the results of the 2020 election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Top brass Rupert Murdoch and Lachlan Murdoch are also expected to be deposed since the parent company has been sued, too. The case is being closely watched by First Amendment experts and advocates in part because of Dominion's lengthy list of examples that Fox network hosts repeatedly made false claims, even after the facts came to light. Libel lawsuits are often centered around one falsehood, and media companies are broadly protected by the First Amendment. Such cases are usually settled out of court or dismissed quickly by a court judge, experts say. But in December, the Delaware judge overseeing the Dominion case denied Fox News' request to have the case dismissed. Neither side has shown signs of entering discussions or reaching a settlement, according to people familiar with the matter, although that could change before the trial's expected start in April. Fox has vigorously denied the claims. \"Fox has put forth a First Amendment argument that this defamation case is aimed at punishing their speech and journalism, and this is an important component of their argument,\" said Roy Gutterman, an expert on communications law and free speech at Syracuse University's Newhouse School of Public Communications. But Gutterman said those rights can be limited \"by the concept of falsity, especially if it can bring harm to an individual or business.\" The depositions are private, as are the documents that Dominion has been collecting through the discovery process. Fox has asked the court to keep all of the collected materials private, claiming that Dominion mischaracterized what the documents show as actual malice. In court papers, Dominion has pointed to the rhetoric of hosts like Bartiromo, a former CNBC anchor, and former host Lou Dobbs and that they continued to feature guests \u2013 including Trump attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Sydney Powell \u2013 who made false claims that voter fraud was the reason Trump didn't surpass Biden to win the 2020 election. Dobbs was also previously scheduled for questioning, filings show. \"Fox, one of the most powerful media companies in the United States, gave life to a manufactured storyline about election fraud that cast a then-little-known voting machine company called Dominion as the villain,\" the company said in its initial court filing in March 2021. Fox News' legal team recently added veteran trial attorney Dan Webb to its roster. Webb told the Washington Post earlier this week that Fox News was only reporting on the news and claims being made by Trump's allies. \"We are confident we will prevail as freedom of the press is foundational to our democracy and must be protected, in addition to the damages claims being outrageous, unsupported and not rooting in sound financial analysis, serving as nothing more than a flagrant attempt to deter our journalists from doing their jobs,\" a Fox News spokesperson said in a statement. To win a defamation case, a plaintiff needs to show that the individual or business they're suing made false statements that caused harm, and that it acted with \"actual malice,\" meaning the speaker knew or should have known what they were saying wasn't true. \"A key issue in these depositions will be the state of mind of Fox as embodied by the journalists covering this or commenting on it,\" said Floyd Abrams, a prominent First Amendment attorney. \"What will someone like Lou Dobbs say? Will he say he believed what he was saying beyond simple reportage?\" Dominion said in court papers that it repeatedly sent emails to notify Fox News that its anchors and their guests were making false claims \u2013 and that Dominion had \"independent fact-checkers, government officials and election security experts\" that quashed those claims. In November 2020, a Dominion representative appeared on a Fox News program to respond to the claims of voter fraud by Trump and his allies. Other current and former Fox News executives have been called on for depositions, court filings show. Dominion has also filed lawsuits against the TV networks One America News and Newsmax. Another voting machine maker, Smartmatic USA, has made similar claims in a defamation lawsuit against Fox News that alleged Dobbs and other hosts falsely accused the company of helping to rig the election. A New York judge earlier this year denied Fox News' motion to dismiss the lawsuit. Shortly after Smartmatic filed its lawsuit, Fox News canceled Dobbs' weekday business show, \"Lou Dobbs Tonight.\" Fox has previously said the move to end Dobbs' program was in the works prior to the lawsuit."},

The VA previously did not provide abortion services, but it said in a news release that it considers access to medically necessary abortions \"essential for preserving the life and health of veterans and VA beneficiaries.\" In light of recent state-level abortion bans around the country after Roe v. Wade was overturned in June, it said it will preserve access by amending its regulations and providing abortions for beneficiaries \"on a case-by-case basis.\" The VA will also begin providing abortion counseling. Both changes also apply to eligible dependents enrolled in the agency's CHAMPVA program. \"This is a patient safety decision,\" said Denis McDonough, secretary of veterans affairs. \"Pregnant Veterans and VA beneficiaries deserve to have access to world-class reproductive care when they need it most. That's what our nation owes them, and that's what we at VA will deliver.\" The regulatory change will be effective as soon as the Federal Register publishes the change, which the VA submitted as an interim rule Thursday night. Once it is, the VA will \"immediately prepare to provide these services in as many locations as possible,\" the agency said in a news release. As federal employees, VA health care providers will be able to provide authorized services regardless of state restrictions, according to the agency. Decisions about if a pregnant person's \"life or health\" are endangered by a pregnancy will be made on a case-by-case basis by VA health care providers in consultation with patients. The VA will consider self-reporting of rape or incest as sufficient evidence in those cases, the agency said. These thresholds of medical necessity are \"in accordance with generally accepted standards of medical practice,\" said Dr. Shereef Elnahal, VA's undersecretary for health. \"We came to this decision after listening to VA health care providers and veterans across the country, who sounded the alarm that abortion restrictions are creating a medical emergency for those we serve.\" The VA excluded abortion coverage when it established its medical benefits package in 1999. While the agency did not provide an explanation for the exclusion, at the time, \"VA was aware that veterans of reproductive age enrolled in its health care system could access abortion services in their communities,\" according to background information provided with the new interim rule. After the Dobbs decision in June, that was no longer the case nationwide, prompting the agency to create exemptions to its exclusion. Once published, the interim rule will be available for public comment for 30 days. More information will be available on the VA's reproductive health website, under \"Abortion Services.\""},

Twitter shares were down more than 1% in premarket trade. The latest filings come after Twitter's former head of security, Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, earlier this month alleged\"extreme, egregious deficiencies\" by the social media company related to privacy, security and content moderation. On July 8, Musk 's legal team initially filed a notice with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to terminate the Twitter acquisition. Musk's team alleged that \"Twitter has not complied with its contractual obligations.\" The follow-up notice, disclosed to the SEC, cites allegations made by Zatko as additional reasons to terminate the deal. \"Allegations regarding certain facts, known to Twitter prior to and as of July 8, 2022, but undisclosed to the Musk Parties prior to and at that time, have since come to light that provide additional and distinct bases to terminate the Merger Agreement,\" Mike Ringler, Musk's legal representative from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, wrote in a letter to Twitter's legal chief, Vijaya Gadde. Ringler said in the letter that the latest termination notice is \"not legally necessary\" to end the merger deal, but is being delivered in case the July 8 filing is \"determined to be invalid for any reason.\" The letter on behalf of Musk said the Zatko complaint \"alleges far-reaching misconduct at Twitter\u2014all of which was disclosed to Twitter's directors and senior executives, including (CEO) Parag Agrawal\u2014that is likely to have severe consequences for Twitter's business.\" Musk's lawyer said Zatko alleges that Twitter is in \"material noncompliance\" with its obligations under its 2011 agreement with the Federal Trade Commission. The letter laid out some of Zatko's other allegations including claims that Twitter is \"uniquely vulnerable to systemic disruption resulting from data center failures or malicious actors,\" something senior management knew about but \"ignored and sought to obfuscate.\" \"These allegations, if true, demonstrate that Twitter has breached the following provisions of the Merger Agreement, thereby giving the Musk Parties the right to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms,\" the letter said. Twitter's legal team responded on Tuesday by sending a letter to Musk's legal representatives. Twitter said Musk's termination case is \"invalid and wrongful under\" the acquisition agreement. \"It is based solely on statements made by a third party that, as Twitter has previously stated, are riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lack important context,\" the letter written by William Savitt of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz law firm said. \"Contrary to the assertions in your letter, Twitter has breached none of its representations or obligations under the Agreement, and Twitter has not suffered and is not likely to suffer a Company Material Adverse Effect.\" Twitter said it intends to enforce the acquisition agreement and \"close the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon\" with Musk. Twitter's legal team said Musk's latest notice to terminate the deal is \"invalid for the independent reason that Mr. Musk and the other Musk Parties continue to knowingly, intentionally, willfully, and materially breach\" the acquisition agreement. The social media giant has previously responded to Zatko. In a memo to staff posted to Twitter on Aug. 23 by CNN correspondent Donie O'Sullivan, Agrawal described Zatko as \"a former Twitter executive who was terminated in January 2022 for ineffective leadership and poor performance.\" Zatko's attorneys issued a statement on Monday in response to that characterization, saying he \"put his career on the line because of his concerns about Twitter users, the public, and the company's shareholders.\" Twitter and Musk will go on trial on Oct. 17 in Delaware to resolve Musk's attempt to cancel his acquisition of the company unless they reach a settlement first. Since proposing the Twitter takeover, Musk has complained that the number of fake or spam accounts on the social media platform is higher than is being disclosed. In the July 8 letter, Musk's legal team claimed the company had \"failed or refused to provide\" information on these accounts to the Tesla CEO. Ahead of the October trial, Musk's legal team has subpoenaed Zatko, seeking information on the company's spam accounts and its alleged security vulnerabilities. \u2014 CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report."},

Trump Media and Technology Group and the SPAC have faced increasing scrutiny in recent months. A federal probe was launched into possible securities violations over the deal. Fox Business reported that Truth Social was in financial trouble and had failed to pay a vendor over $1 million in contractually obligated payments, an allegation which the company denied. DWAC itself warned shareholders that a decline in the ex-president's popularity could hurt the deal. Indeed, the vote comes amid a Justice Department criminal probe into whether Trump illegally removed thousands of White House documents, including those marked \"Top Secret\" and \"Classified,\" to his Mar-a-Lago private home after he left the presidency. Truth Social has faced its own scrutiny. The app was barred from the Google Play store for violating the store's policies regarding the moderation of user-generated content. The platform remains accessible online and on the Apple App Store. DWAC and Trump Media face a Thursday deadline to complete the merger, and the SPAC is eagerly seeking an extension. DWAC needs 65% of shareholders to approve the delay. Patrick Orlando, DWAC's CEO, has issued a barrage of pleas to shareholders through various channels, including Truth Social, urging them to approve the extension. Non-votes are essentially counted as \"no\" votes. Some of the SPACs institutional investors, including Lighthouse Investment Partners and Pentwater Capital Management, didn't comment on the upcoming vote when reached by CNBC. Citadel Investment Group said the company is holding stock as a \"market maker,\" not as a voting shareholder. DWAC has warned previously that a \"no\" result could force DWAC into liquidation. The SPAC does, however, have built-in extensions of up to six months that can be initiated by sponsors adding money to the trust. Orlando's company, ARC Global Investments, holds 20% of these votes itself, he disclosed in an interview last Thursday with IPO Edge. Still, he said, \"the retail shareholder holds a lot of weight.\" Trump Media and Technology Group and Truth Social were founded after Trump was banned from Twitter following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. On that day, his supporters stormed the building in an attempt to prevent the certification of Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election. Trump Media announced in October 2021 that it would merge with DWAC to take the company public. Trump Media, headed by Republican former U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes, has said it also plans on launching TMTG News and TMTG+ video streaming services. The high-profile nature of the merger has brought in more retail investors than SPACs normally attract. The SPACs institutional investors largely did not respond to a request for comment. For investors, DWAC's liquidation would pay out around $10 per share. Shares of the so-called blank check company have traded around $25 of late. This is far from its 2022 peak of about $97 in March. Weak turnout in the shareholder vote could squash the deal. \"Let's #rocktheproxy,\" the Florida-based Orlando said in one of his many Truth Social posts during the voting period. \"Shooting for huge engagement and voter participation!!!!\" When questioned about probes into the DWAC-Trump Media deal, Orlando said that DWAC was \"aware of many targets\" prior to the offering, and that the company was complying with all probe requests. \"If there's an inquiry, we respond to the inquiry. If there's a procedure that we have to go through, we go through that procedure,\" Orlando said in the IPO Edge interview. The DWAC CEO also said Trump remained the chairman of Trump Media, countering reports that he left the board just weeks before the company was subpoenaed. Orlando reiterated the potential risks brought about by Trump's volatile public popularity. \"There's a risk factor. We need to let people know these are things you should think about,\" Orlando told IPO Edge. \"If certain events occur that are negative, they will negatively impact a stock.\" The results of the shareholder vote are expected to be announced Tuesday, barring a decision by the company to adjourn the meeting. \u2013 CNBC's Yun Li contributed to this report."},

Paramount and Skydance's \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" alongside Disney and Marvel Studio's \"Doctor Strange in the Mulitverse of Madness,\" reignited the movie theater business, driving million to theaters and racking up hundreds of million in ticket sales. The two films kicked off the summer movie season, which runs from May through August, and are the two top-grossing movies released domestically this year. However, with only a handful of major releases during the summer season, ticket sales dwindled in late July and fell throughout August. In fact, the box office generated less than $100 million in each of the last five weeks of the summer period, according to data from Comscore. \"It definitely ended on a whimper,\" said Shawn Robbins, chief media analyst at BoxOffice.com. Big franchises including Universal's\"Jurassic World: Dominion,\" \"Minions: The Rise of Gru\" and Disney's \"Thor: Love and Thunder\" lifted the box office, but without smaller and mid-tier budgeted films to fill the gaps, the summer box office failed to capitalize on its momentum. While audiences have returned to cinemas, and are spending more on premium tickets and popcorn, there are still lingering pandemic issues. Those issues include production shutdowns that delayed film shoots and pressure on visual effects houses to complete projects on shortened deadlines. This means that the movie calendar, while filling back up, is far from running on all cylinders. Over the summer, just 22 films were launched in theaters, down 47.6% compared to 2019, Comscore data shows. And this is a trend that's been seen all year long. From January to end of August in 2019, Hollywood released 75 films in cinemas. In 2022, so far, it's only released 46. There will be more month-to-month consistency next year, Robbins said. Despite nearly 50% fewer film releases during this four-month period, the domestic box still tallied $3.34 billion in ticket sales, down just 21% from 2019 levels. \"The results are impressive,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. \"Summer movies like 'Top Gun: Maverick,' 'Doctor Strange 2,' 'Jurassic World: Dominion,' and others, punched above their weight in May, June, and July, boosting not only sales, but confidence in the industry after moving in fits and starts over the course of 2020 and 2021.\" \"However, a fall slowdown has given the industry a bit of a post-summer hangover with worries that only a handful of apparent blockbusters wait in the wings to bolster the fortunes of the third quarter box office,\" he said. As it stands, there are currently only four would-be blockbuster releases coming to theaters before the end of December, including Warner Bros.' \"Black Adam\" in October, Disney's \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\" and \"Strange World\" in November, and Disney's \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" in December. For comparison, in 2019, there were nearly two dozen blockbuster-style films slated on the calendar for the last four months of the year, including \"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,\" \"Jumanji: The Next Level\" and \"Frozen II.\" The domestic box office has generated around $5.3 billion since January, down around 31% compared to 2019, but remains on pace to deliver around $7.5 billion in total ticket sales by the end of the year, Dergarabedian said. \"That's frankly a great outcome for an industry that saw 2020 levels at a mere $2.3 billion and a 2021 that wound up at $4.6 billion,\" he said. Next year looks stronger. Already the calendar has significantly more titles, as well as a more diverse collection of genres and budgets, including Marvel's \"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,\" \"Dungeons & Dragons\" and \"John Wick 4.\" \"2023 gets things rolling on a much better foot,\" Robbins said.

In a series of letters sent Tuesday morning, the committee asked four agencies, including the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Trade Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as five digital asset exchanges \u2014 Coinbase, FTX, Binance.US, Kraken, and KuCoin \u2014 for information and documents about what they are doing, if anything, to safeguard consumers against scams and combat cryptocurrency-related fraud. More than $1 billion in crypto has been lost to fraud since the start of 2021, according to research from the FTC. \"As stories of skyrocketing prices and overnight riches have attracted both professional and amateur investors to cryptocurrencies, scammers have cashed in,\" wrote Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D.-Ill., Chair of the Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy. \"The lack of a central authority to flag suspicious transactions in many situations, the irreversibility of transactions, and the limited understanding many consumers and investors have of the underlying technology make cryptocurrency a preferred transaction method for scammers.\" The letters ask that the federal agencies and crypto exchanges respond by Sept. 12 with information about what they are doing to protect consumers. The committee says that these responses could be used to craft legislative solutions. In particular, the letters ask that the exchanges produce documents dating back through Jan. 1, 2009, which display efforts to combat crypto scams and fraud, as well as show attempts made to \"identify, investigate, and remove or flag potentially fraudulent digital assets or accounts,\" as well as highlight discussions around \"whether to adopt more stringent policies.\" In one letter, addressed to Sam Bankman-Fried, the CEO and founder of FTX, the committee notes that \"while some exchanges review cryptocurrencies before listing them, others allow digital assets to be listed with little or no vetting.\" Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis found that 37% of crypto scam revenue last year went to \"rug pulls,\" a type of scheme that involves developers listing a token on an exchange, pumping it up, and then vanishing with the funds. Binance.US, which also received an inquiry from the committee on Tuesday, has been accused in a class action lawsuit of misleading consumers about the safety of investing in the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin known as terraUSD (or UST, for short) and its sister token, luna. At their height, luna and UST had a combined market value of almost $60 billion. Now, they're essentially worthless. Concern over the safety of crypto funds parked on centralized platforms has also been gaining traction following the recent collapse of Voyager Digital and Celsius, both popular apps among retail traders because of the double-digit annual percentage yield once offered by the two companies. The subsequent bankruptcies of these two platforms have highlighted the question of who owns cryptocurrency assets when a custodial business goes belly up. In the bankruptcy proceedings of both Voyager and Celsius, customers are considered unsecured creditors, rather than federally-insured bank depositors, meaning there is no guarantee they will get any of their money back. As for the relationship between investor and crypto exchange, the terms and conditions vary. In a financial filing released in May, Coinbase said its users would be treated as \"general unsecured creditors\" in the event of bankruptcy. Krishnamoorthi also noted that the agencies often seem to be acting at cross-purposes and giving inconsistent guidance to private-sector players. \"Without clear definitions and guidance, agencies will continue their infighting and will be unable effectively to implement consumer and investor protections related to cryptocurrencies and the exchanges on which they are traded.\""},

In an interview on \"Mad Money,\" Brown indicated Motorola's business remains resilient despite concerns of a slowing global economy because a major upgrade cycle is underway. \"What we do is a need to have, not a nice to have. This is the strongest demand environment I've ever seen,\" said Brown, who has led Motorola Solutions for more than a decade. Motorola makes two-way radios used by police and fire departments; security video systems; and command center software, among other things. Brown said Motorola Solutions stands to benefit from the Biden administration's $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill, which passed in 2021 and included dedicated funds for public safety investments. More generally, Brown told Jim Cramer there's a private-network radio upgrade cycle taking place that will boost the company's business in the years to come. \"Those radios refresh every seven years. And we're in the first or second inning radio refresh here in North America \u2014 so New York, Chicago, Las Vegas, L.A., they're Motorola,\" Brown said. \"The demand is the best, record backlog.

The Hangzhou, China-headquartered firm bought Quantic Dream, marking the establishment of its first fully owned gaming studio in Europe. NetEase and its rival Tencent have been upping their efforts overseas as the Chinese domestic games market slows down amid tighter regulation. Over the years, Tencent has been prolific in acquisitions and investments in overseas gaming companies. NetEase is now catching up. This year alone, NetEase has set up gaming studios in Japan and the U.S. NetEase has typically been focused on PC and mobile gaming, extremely popular formats in China. Mobile gaming makes up more than half of its global games revenues. But more recently, the tech giant has been expanding into console games. Quantic Dream, a 25-year-old studio, will focus \"on creating and publishing its video games on all platforms, as well as supporting and publishing third-party developed titles,\" according to a press release. That highlights NetEase's intention to grow across mobile, PC and consoles. The acquisition of Quantic Dream is in line with NetEase's strategy of acquiring well-known international characters and franchises. Quantic Dream is currently developing a game called Star Wars Eclipse, based on Disney's space adventure movies. NetEase has already released mobile games based on the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. NetEase's international push comes as regulators in China continue to scrutinize the games market, though there are signs of some easing. Last year, authorities restricted the amount of time those under 18 years old could play online games and froze the approval of new titles. In China, games need the green light from regulators to be released and monetized. Those approvals restarted in April. In an interview with CNBC last year, Hu Zhipeng, vice president at NetEase and one of the top bosses of the technology giant's video games business, said that he aims to eventually have 50% of the company's gaming revenue come from overseas, up from around 10% now. Competition in the global games market is heating up. Sony, a leader in console gaming and producer of the PlayStation, announced on Tuesday that it is setting up a dedicated mobile division, which will put it in competition with the likes of Chinese giants Tencent and NetEase."},

The lawsuit also names MicroStrategy as a defendant. Racine alleges the company conspired to help Saylor evade the taxes. The AG's office said it's seeking to recover a total sum of over $100 million in unpaid taxes and penalties. Shares of MicroStrategy were down more than 6% Wednesday afternoon on the news. Saylor, who oversaw the company's push into bitcoin, stepped down as CEO earlier this month. Under his leadership, MicroStrategy spent close to $4 billion acquiring bitcoin at an average price of $30,700, and he has said he considers the company's stock a sort of bitcoin ETF. Saylor allegedly claimed to reside in Virginia or Florida, which have lower or no personal income tax rates, while actually living in several different homes around D.C., including a penthouse apartment in the Georgetown neighborhood or on his yacht on the Georgetown waterfront or Potomac River when the apartment was undergoing renovations, according to the lawsuit. The suit includes several screenshots of posts that appear to be from Saylor's Facebook page dating back several years and referencing the view from his \"Georgetown balcony\" and discussing his \"home\" while tagging Washington, D.C. MicroStrategy allegedly \"had detailed information confirming that Saylor was in fact a DC resident,\" according to a press release, but it chose to withhold that information. In a statement, MicroStrategy said, \"The case is a personal tax matter involving Mr. Saylor. The Company was not responsible for his day-to-day affairs and did not oversee his individual tax responsibilities. Nor did the Company conspire with Mr. Saylor in the discharge of his personal tax responsibilities. The District of Columbia's claims against the Company are false and we will defend aggressively against this overreach.\" Around 2014, the AG's office claims in the lawsuit, MicroStrategy's then-chief financial officer confronted Saylor about his alleged tax evasion being a potential liability for the company. Saylor and MicroStrategy ended up reaching an agreement where Saylor's salary would be reduced to a nominal $1, the lawsuit claims, in order to reduce the risk authorities would discover the alleged scheme. Still, the AG alleges, Saylor continued to benefit from \"fringe benefits\" with a \"high cash value,\" such as use of the company plane. \"A decade ago, I bought an historic house in Miami Beach and moved my home there from Virginia,\" Saylor said in a statement. \"Although MicroStrategy is based in Virginia, Florida is where I live, vote, and have reported for jury duty, and it is at the center of my personal and family life. I respectfully disagree with the position of the District of Columbia, and look forward to a fair resolution in the courts.\" The suit is the first to be brought under a recently passed law called the False Claims Act, according to Racine's office. The district law incentivizes whistleblowers to report tax fraud and allows the court to impose penalties up to three times the amount of the evaded taxes, according to the AG's office. The district suit follows a separate complaint filed by whistleblowers against Saylor in April 2021, accusing him of failing to pay income taxes from 2014 through 2020. The complaint was filed under seal but made public on Wednesday. The AG's office said it independently investigated the whistleblower case and found MicroStrategy had filed inaccurate W-2s with his Florida-based address and had failed to withhold taxes allegedly owed to the district. The new lawsuit alleges Saylor failed to pay income tax he owed to the district starting in 2005. \u2014 MacKenzie Sigalos contributed to this story.

CEO Evan Spiegel announced the moves in a memo Tuesday, and told employees the company needs to restructure its business to deal with its financial challenges. He said the company's current year-over-year revenue growth rate for the quarter of 8% \"is well below what we were expecting earlier this year.\" \"While we have built substantial capital reserves, and have made extensive efforts to avoid reductions in the size of our team by reducing spend in other areas, we must now face the consequences of our lower revenue growth and adapt to the market environment,\" Spiegel said. \"We are restructuring our business to increase focus on our three strategic priorities: community growth, revenue growth, and augmented reality.\" Other projects the company nuked include its Snap Minis third-party apps and Snap Games. Spiegel said Snap is also starting the \"process of winding down\" its Zenly map product and Voisey music feature, which were both inherited through acquisitions. Snap has also promoted Jerry Hunter from senior vice president of engineering to chief operating officer. Hunter will continue leading Snap's engineering unit, Spiegel said. The company said it hired Ronan Harris, Google's vice president and managing director of U.K. and Ireland, to be its president of the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, a new position. Harris will join Snap's executive team. Spiegel said Snap is currently searching for presidents of the company's Asia-Pacific and Americas regions, also two new roles. \"Changes of this magnitude are never easy, and we must act decisively to meet this moment as a team,\" Spiegel said. \"I am proud of the strength and resilience of our team as we have navigated the myriad challenges of growing our business in a highly competitive industry during uncertain and unprecedented times.\" In July, Snap shares cratered more than 25% after the company reported second-quarter results that missed on both the top and bottom lines and said it would not provide guidance for its current quarter. The company said at the time that it planned to \"substantially\" slow its hiring rate and operating expense growth rate. Like other social media companies, including Facebook parent Meta, Pinterest and Twitter, Snap said a confluence of factors has simultaneously hurt the company's business. They include a weakening macroeconomic environment and Apple 's 2021 iOS update, which made it more difficult for social media companies to track users on behalf of third-party advertisers. The rise of TikTok's short-video service has also posed a significant challenge for Snap and its competitors. Snap said it was scrapping development of its Pixy drone after reports surfaced that the company was pausing its work on the device. The drone was supposed to be a fun way for users to take photos of themselves from multiple angles. Snap has been trying to build a consumer hardware business and announced the $230 drone in April."},
{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/01/for-industrial-cobot-its-been-a-decade-in-search-of-a-permanent-job-.html", "title": "A robot named Baxter wanted to change the world of work, but his career ended early", "paragraphs": " In this weekly series, CNBC takes a look at companies that made the inaugural Disruptor 50 list, 10 years later. One of the enduring lessons of the iPhone era is that Steve Jobs led with what the consumer didn't know they wanted until he showed it to them. Robotics pioneer Rodney Brooks has operated from a similar idea \u2014 with varying degrees of success. His robot vacuum cleaner Roomba, and its parent company iRobot, which more or less made the category of robotic vacuums an inexpensive, must-have for many consumers, was recently sold to Amazon for $1.7 billion. \"iRobot found a product-market fit. It had a feature set and a cost that lots and lots of people were willing to pay for, that puck-shaped thing that cleans the floor pretty well,\" said Matt Beane, an assistant professor in the technology management program at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and a robotics expert. But another of Brooks' big, early ideas, hasn't worked out the way he or the world imagined. Rethink Robotics was founded in 2008 with the idea that a cobot \u2014 a robot working alongside humans in ways that traditional automation couldn't (i.e. with much less danger to the human), and without the fencing that most industrial robots remained inside \u2014 was a market waiting to be made among industrial customers. But for all the novel ideas that Brooks and his Rethink colleagues brought to the table, its first cobot never caught on. It caught on in the press, for sure, and if you were following tech news at the beginning of the last decade you likely saw Baxter and \"his eyes\" staring out from the screen between his arms at some point in a photo or video footage. At CNBC, we learned firsthand the limitations of working with novel industrial robots when we invited Baxter on-air for a live segment as part of Rethink being named to the inaugural Disruptor 50 list in 2013. For technical reasons, it would have been a lot more difficult than we imagined to get Baxter onto the television studio set. While he may not be a part of the robotic future anymore, there is no history of the cobot that can be written without Baxter. \"There is no such thing as the cobot without Rod Brooks,\" Beane said. \"Rethink started the industry.\" After a lot of early fanfare, reality set in for Rethink. By 2018, it was struggling to scale its operations and find enough buyers for Baxter, with its two-armed design proving to be a novel idea, but a mistake. \"No one needs a two-armed robot,\" Beane said, describing that design decision as \"humans projecting onto a robot their own physical form.\" Rethink pivoted, in what turned out to be a move made too late, to a one-armed robot named Sawyer. But the technology had other problems. Rethink bet on an approach that used elastic actuators \u2014 a technology one of Brooks co-founders was an expert on \u2014 which allowed the robot to perform \"force sensing,\" an approach the company backed because it would make the robots safer around human coworkers. Rethink's design would also make the robots low cost, getting rid of standard industry reliance on motors and related parts. Paul Maeder, a mechanical engineer who invested early in Rethink through his VC firm, told the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in a post-mortem on Rethink that goes deep into the technical shortcomings, that cheaper parts plus force sensing seemed like the way to bring down pricing in the robotics market and appeal to customers. And it did bring down pricing. \"The reality is that they had a very low price point, shockingly low,\" Beane said. \"They had done an amazingly good job at materials sourcing and design, and they were headed to one-third or one-quarter of the price for other robots.\" But Rethink never achieved the market penetration or scale it needed to maintain its operations. As the financials worsened, Rethink became the acquisition target of a Chinese firm, a deal Beane says would have had a good shot at getting the firm to scale. But that deal was scuttled \"at the last moment,\" according to the company, and a 2018 bankruptcy followed. Rethink was bought out of bankruptcy by German automation company Hahn Group, which is still trying to make the technology a success today. In a statement provided to TechCrunch at the time of its demise, Rethink said, \"We were early to market with a very innovative product that was ahead of its time, and unfortunately, we did not achieve the commercial success we had expected.\" It's true Rethink had no shortage of interesting, innovative ideas, even if they weren't the right ones for the market. According to Beane, one of the most intriguing was the ability for the cobot to be programmed by the worker. \"People don't make much of this feature anymore, but that was a graphic user interface system which didn't require code and you could teach it, train it to do a job as the worker,\" Beane said. \"But no manager would turn those features on,\" he added. That's an idea that Brooks is still working on today, through his latest robotics startup Robust.ai, co-founded with cognitive scientist Gary Marcus, which is making a warehouse cobot, Carter, that is like a mobile shopping cart providing transport within fulfillment centers. \"It can drive in any direction and is worker programmable and can physically collaborate,\" Beane said. \"A lot of the same DNA is there.\" Once Sawyer became the lead cobot, Rethink invested in a technology that integrated the cobot with preexisting industrial automation, an interesting approach, but ultimately, another bottleneck that was costly in engineering time to connect and to get to communicate with machinery like conveyors. \"Just to alter the speed of a conveyor is extremely expensive,\" Beane said. The DNA that has become standard in the cobot market that Baxter, and later Sawyer, hoped to dominate, is from Rethink rival and Denmark-based Universal Robots. While its cobots may be \"very boring looking\" in Beane's view, they were what the market ultimately wanted. \"In the end, the series elastic actuators were probably not the best idea in the world,\" Maeder told ASME. \"What customers really want is a low-cost, simple, fast, repeatable robot. They want to put something in this exact location again, and again and again. In the end, that was a lot more complicated for us to achieve than for some of our competitors because they weren't trying to do force sensing.\" Even the two arms that Baxter had could always be purchased by a buyer if they really wanted that approach, by purchasing two single-arm robots, and that's what Universal Robots \u2014 which was acquired by industrial automation company Teradyne in 2015 \u2014 excels at, with its UR3, UR5 and UR7 cobots leading to increased sales, and successive generations of its cobot line continuing to hit the market. The opportunity for robotics technology remains significant, though it is still trailing other automation approaches in market penetration. Robot sales in the North American market have been growing, and the Teradyne unit led by Universal Robots is seeing steady, if not explosive, sales growth, too. Revenue was $300 million in 2019, and then increased to $376 million last year after a Covid dip. According to Wall Street estimates, sales could reach $440 million this year, or about 18% growth. That growth rate is higher than the percentage of overall revenue it represents, which is still under 15%. \"A lot more will occur,\" Beane said. \"Progress often looks slow up close ... but the utility of a robotic system that can accomplish general tasks at a reasonable cost is extraordinary, billions, maybe trillions worth of value,\" he added. And costs keep going down, from batteries to sensors and software, meaning the price performance for robots keeps going up steadily. But where the cobot finds its greatest utility remains an open question. While the industrial world use has been in the first decades often as much a marketing ploy or, at best, an experiment rather than proof of widespread adoption, there is reason to forecast multiple roles for cobots based on an aging demographic. \"Anyone who says not in my lifetime, you better hope it is in your lifetime, because you will need help,\" Beane said. He anticipates that jobs outside of the manufacturing sector with which cobots have been associated \u2014 from warehousing to retail, medical (think cobots bringing supplies to nurses) and retirement communities \u2014 are areas poised for growing use. \"Manufacturing is about high throughput and high consistency and you can automate the heck out of it without a cobot,\" Beane said. \"We're only just getting started on this capability being useful and used at scale.\" Rodney Brooks is among the robotics experts who has spoken about a world that is getting older and a working population that is not as strong. He wrote in a blog post covering his annual predictions that \"soon the houses of the elderly will be cluttered with too many robots.\" Wall Street analysts are focused on the opportunity presented by a chronic labor shortage, and related changes taking place in a global outsourcing paradigm which economies including the U.S. have been relying on for decades. With \"near shoring\" and onshoring of more manufacturing activity, there is increasing demand for labor in a tight labor market. One answer is automation, and technology like Universal Robots is relatively easy to program and implement. But one big issue the cobots have not yet solved is the same one that started Brooks down the Rethink path: figuring out what everyone wants from this technology, the \"killer app,\" so to speak, for the cobot. Universal Robots has many different applications for its technology, but not a single one that drives strong demand within one very high volume market. That's a solvable problem, but still a work in progress. Robots running popcorn stations in a movie theatre or robot cafe baristas aren't the career opportunity that takes the cobots to center stage in the economy. But there is a shortage of people and automation has to be one of the solutions, even if it doesn't happen by tomorrow. We have not reached a world of genuine physical collaboration between human worker and cobot, Beane says, \"the kind of stuff where humans reach over to grab the next thing and the robot sees I am reaching and hands it to me and we might even brush up against each other,\" but, \"We are getting there,\" he added. The automated systems that are most widely deployed remain the ones that are more dangerous and kept at a distance. But Beane thinks that Rethink came closer to solving the problem than it is given credit for, and has yet to prove in its new life under Hahn. Hahn did not respond to a request for comment by press time. \"Another eight months and maybe they might have gotten product-market fit. It was inexpensive and reliable. I really do believe we could have seen an iPhone moment,\" Beane said. In his personal blog, Brooks summed up the Rethink story this way: \"Baxter and Sawyer were the first safe robots that did not require a cage to keep humans away from them for the humans' protection. And Sawyer was the first modern industrial robot which finally got away from having a computer-like language to control it, as all robots had since the idea was first developed at the Stanford AI Lab back in the very early seventies. There is still a lot remaining to be done.\""},

In a filing with the SEC, Nvidia said the U.S. government told the company on Aug. 26, about a new license requirement for future exports to China, including Hong Kong, to reduce the risk that the products may be used by the Chinese military. Nvidia said the restriction would affect the A100 and H100 products, which are graphics processing units sold to businesses. \"The license requirement also includes any future Nvidia integrated circuit achieving both peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance equal to or greater than thresholds that are roughly equivalent to the A100, as well as any system that includes those circuits,\" the filing said. The company expects that it could lose $400 million in potential sales in China in the current quarter after previously forecasting revenue of $5.9 billion. The new rule also applies to sales to Russia, but Nvidia said it doesn't have paying customers there. In recent years, the U.S. government has applied increasing export restrictions to chips made with U.S. technology because of fears that Chinese companies could use them for military purposes or steal trade secrets. Nvidia said it was applying for a license to continue some Chinese exports but doesn't know whether the U.S. government will grant an exemption. \"We are working with our customers in China to satisfy their planned or future purchases with alternative products and may seek licenses where replacements aren't sufficient,\" an Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC. \"The only current products that the new licensing requirement applies to are A100, H100 and systems such as DGX that include them.\" An AMD representative confirmed to CNBC that it had also received new licensing requirements from the U.S. Department of Commerce which it believed applied to its MI250 circuit, which is intended for artificial intellegence. AMD said it did not believe the new requirements would cause a material impact to its business. In a statement to CNBC, a department spokesperson said \"While we are not in a position to outline specific policy changes at this time, we are taking a comprehensive approach to implement additional actions necessary related to technologies, end-uses, and end-users to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.\" WATCH: Semiconductor market signaling a surplus"},

It's also working with dairy farmers to help them reduce emissions produced on their farms. While electricity and transportation tend to get most of the attention when it comes to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, agriculture is a massive contributor. Breakthrough Energy Ventures has segmented global emissions into five categories, and agriculture is the third worst offender, responsible for 19% of total greenhouse gas emissions, behind manufacturing (31%) and electricity (27%), but ahead of transportation (16%) and buildings (7%). Neutral Foods milk is in about 2,000 grocery stores and has already received funding from a diverse roster of celebrity investors, including Mark Cuban, NBA stars LeBron James and Kevin Love, Tobias Harris, and musicians John Legend and Questlove. The company is planning to expand into butter, and eventually meat. \"It's clear that consumers are hungry for sustainable, climate-forward options and they're reflecting that in their purchasing decisions, especially when it comes to buying food and beverages,\" Carmichael Roberts, one half of the investing committee at Bill Gates' investment fund, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, told CNBC. Neutral Foods measures the carbon emissions of the entire lifecycle of its products and purchases carbon offsets for the measured emissions, Ann Radil, the Head of Carbon Reduction at Neutral Foods, told CNBC. Carbon credits are permits that businesses buy to certify greenhouse gasses have been removed from the atmosphere. While not all carbon credits are reliably policed, Neutral Foods says it uses only offsets verified by Climate Action Reserve (CAR), which it says are quite strict. CAR offsets are \"real, additional, permanent, verifiable, and enforceable,\" said Lauren Brown, senior manager of carbon reduction data and analytics for Neutral Foods. Long-term, the company's plan is to work with farms to reduce their greenhouse emissions directly. Currently, Neutral Foods has eight distinct projects underway at farms it works with and 30 projects in some phase of development, Radil told CNBC. Those projects include changing what cows eat and changing how cow manure is managed. Separating and composting manure \"alone can reduce manure-related GHG emissions like methane and nitrous oxide by 19 to 50 percent,\" Radil told CNBC. Also, Neutral Foods is working with farms to change the way they plant things on the farm to improve the amount of carbon that gets absorbed by the soil. The start-up both guides farmers to help them make changes in the operations on their farms to reduce emissions and then also provides the financing to make those changes, explains CEO Marcus Lovell Smith. Helping farmers lower the emissions on their farms requires approaching farmers with respect. \"You don't go onto a farm and tell a farmer what to do,\" said Smith, who runs his own dairy farm in New Hampshire. \"Farmers are one of the most independent minded groups of people in the country. So I learned that pretty quickly.\" One partner is Groeneveld Farms, a dairy farm with 240 cows, located in Snohomish County, Washington. The farm grows 90% of its feed, and Neutral Foods has helped it figure out how to plant two different crops -- corn and grass -- at the same time.This process, sometimes known as \"co-cropping\" or \"relay cropping\" means the farm only has to till the ground once, which decreases the amount of fossil fuels used on the farm. \"We can do this in a way that works really well for where we are located here in Washington,\" Groeneveld told CNBC. \"Neutral found this appealing and it's something that works within both of our collective budgets to try out.\" Neutral Foods started its product line with milk, which it currently sells at Amazon -owned Whole Foods, Target stores on the West Coast, Sprouts, and various other grocers. The price of Neutral Foods is \"pretty much in the middle of the pack for organic milk,\" CEO Smith said. Results so far are positive. \"We are pleased with how customers are reacting and purchasing the Neutral Foods products. Based on that, we are looking at other opportunities to expand with them into other items,\" said Sprouts spokesperson Steve Nieto. Starting in August, Neutral Foods will start selling carbon neutral pasture-raised butter, and it's planning to expand its product repertoire to include beef as well. Carman Ranch, located in the Wallowa Valley in northeast Oregon, raises cows and hogs. Owner Cory Carman, reached out to Neutral Foods to see they were working on any carbon emissions tracking programs for beef. \"We know that there are so many innovations in agriculture that can make a huge difference in greenhouse gas emissions or carbon sequestration, but discovering how those innovations play out in specific regions, or testing new ones is incredibly hard for individual ranchers,\" Carman told CNBC. Carman Ranch is what is called a \"century farm\" because the same family has worked the farm for over a hundred years. Cory herself grew up on the ranch and has worked at the ranch for the last two decades. \"Neutral has helped bring us technology, resources, and information that I would never had access to and that I am now sharing across my network.\" Carman Ranch has learned about feed supplements for cattle that lower the methane that cows belch out when they digest their food, Carman told CNBC. Currently, Carman Ranch is running trials with Neutral Foods to plant feed for their cows to graze on that contain condensed tannins. \"They are nutritious to our animals, promote soil health and can lower methane emissions,\" Carman told CNBC. Carman Ranch is also running a trial with Neutral Foods to put a seaweed supplement into the feed for 50 cattle. For this pilot program, Neutral Foods and the company making the seaweed supplement, Symbrosia, \"will bring leading researchers, partners, equipment, and procedures to measure methane emissions and weight gain, conduct a full life cycle analysis, and generate verified carbon credits,\" Carman said. It will take time for the projects Neutral Foods is doing with farms to be fully implemented and measurably reduce the emissions of their products, Radil told CNBC. But for now, Gates' investment fund is encouraged by the steps Neutral Foods is making. \"It sends a critical price signal to farmers that climate-forward practices have value. As they continue to improve upon those decarbonization techniques, there's an opportunity for scale at the farm level that can mirror the brand's growth and retail expansion,\" Roberts told CNBC. Fellow investor Marc Cuban, who put money into the company last October, agrees. \"I think consumers are becoming increasingly concerned about the impact of the products they consume on the environment,\" Cuban told CNBC. \"I think Neutral is well positioned to meet that demand.\""},

Thursday's announcement follows the largest climate funding package in U.S. history, which President Joe Biden signed into law in August. The package includes incentives to jump-start domestic supply chains for electric vehicle batteries, although Piedmont said plans for the plant were in development prior to the Inflation Reduction Act. Now that the company has selected the site in McMinn County, it will begin the process of securing the necessary permits, which can be lengthy. Still, the company is targeting construction beginning in 2023, with production starting in 2025. When fully operational, the plant will produce 30,000 metric tons of lithium per year, making it the largest lithium refining facility in the U.S, according to the company. Piedmont said it will churn out enough material to supply roughly 500,000 electric vehicles annually. Piedmont currently has no active mines in the U.S., so once the facility is up and running it will process spodumene concentrate from Piedmont's international operations in Quebec and Ghana. Eventually, the company hopes to use lithium that's mined domestically. The company has plans for a mine as well as another plant in North Carolina, although CEO Keith Phillips said it's challenging from a permitting perspective, since both the mine and the plant are on the same site. Albemarle runs the only meaningful lithium mine in the U.S., which is in Silver Peak, Nevada. Additionally, only 2.1% of lithium is refined in the U.S., according to data from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. China dominates the industry, refining more than half of global lithium supply. Should Piedmont's North Carolina mine and plant secure the required permits, however, the company forecasts its lithium output doubling, with the company supplying 1 million electric vehicles per year. Piedmont Lithium's announcement also comes as automakers are rushing toward vast electric vehicle fleets. By some forecasts, there simply won't be enough lithium to meet demand in the foreseeable future. The International Energy Agency estimates that in order to meet the goals set forth in the Paris Agreement, lithium demand will grow by over 40 times by 2040. Building new mines takes years. They're capital intensive and can face permitting challenges. There are also those opposed to new mines, who argue that the world should instead focus on existing production. Piedmont's Phillips noted that in just the last year $33 billion has been announced for electric vehicle battery manufacturing plants in the U.S., which would require 500,000 metric tons of lithium annually. \"That is more than all the lithium hydroxide produced in the world currently, so clearly the industry is facing a critical resource shortage,\" he told CNBC. \"Anyone who can produce material to supply this market \u2014 especially domestically in the United States \u2014 will be in a favored position.\" Piedmont plans to invest around $600 million developing the Tennessee facility."},

The Swedish payments firm generated revenues of 9.1 billion Swedish krona ($950 million) in the period spanning January to the end of June 2022. That was up 24% from a year ago. But the company also racked up hefty losses. Klarna's pre-tax loss soared more than threefold year-on-year to nearly 6.2 billion krona. In the first half of 2021, Klarna lost around 1.8 billion Swedish krona. The company, which allows users to spread the cost of purchases over interest-free installments, saw a jump in operating expenses and defaults. Operating expenses before credit losses came in at 10.8 billion Swedish krona, up from 6.3 billion krona year-over-year, driven by administrative costs related to its rapid international expansion in countries like the U.S. Credit losses, meanwhile, rose more than 50% to 2.9 billion Swedish krona. Klarna had previously been profitable for most of its existence \u2014 that is up until 2019, when the firm dipped into the red for the first time after a hike in investments aimed at growing the business globally. The company's ballooning losses highlight the price of its rapid expansion after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Klarna has entered 11 new markets since the start of 2020, and took a number of costly gambits to extend its foothold in the U.S. and Britain. In the U.S., Klarna has spent heavily on marketing and user acquisition in an effort to chip away at Affirm, its main rival stateside. In the U.K., meanwhile, the firm acquired PriceRunner, a price comparison site, in April. It has also engaged in a charm offensive with British politicians and regulators ahead of incoming regulations. More recently, Klarna has been forced to cut back. In May, the company slashed about 10% of its global workforce in a swift round of job cuts. The company subsequently raised raised funds at a $6.7 billion valuation \u2014 an 85% drop from its previous valuation \u2014 in an $800 million investment deal that defined the capitulation from high-growth tech firms as investors grew wary of a possible recession. The sharp discount reflected grim sentiment among investors in fintech in both the public and private markets, with publicly-listed fintech Affirm having lost about three quarters of its market value since the start of 2022. \"We've had to make some tough decisions, ensuring we have the right people, in the right place, focused on business priorities that will accelerate us back to profitability while supporting consumers and retailers through a more difficult economic period,\" said Sebastian Siemiatkowski, CEO and co-founder of Klarna. \"We needed to take immediate and pre-emptive action, which I think was misunderstood at the time, but now sadly we have seen many other companies follow suit.\" Klarna said it plans to tighten its approach to lending, particularly with new customers, to factor in the worsening cost-of-living situation. However, Siemiatkowski said, \"You won't see the impact of this on our financials in this report yet.\" \"We have a very agile balance sheet, especially in comparison to traditional banks due to the short-term nature of our products, but even for Klarna it takes a little while for the impact of decisions to flow through.\" Fintech companies are cutting expenses and delaying listing plans amid a worsening macroeconomic backdrop. Meanwhile, consumer-oriented services are losing their appeal among investors while so-called \"business-to-business\" fintechs attract the limelight. Klarna says it is now used by over 150 million people, while the company counts 450,000 merchants on its network. Klarna mainly generates income from retailers, not users, taking a small slice of each transaction processed through its platform. \"Ultimately they've proven there can be a profitable business there but have doubled down on growing in the U.S. market which is expensive,\" Simon Taylor, head of strategy at fintech startup Sardine.ai, told CNBC. \"Market share there will be meaningful for long-term revenue. But it takes time and the funding taps aren't what they used to be.\" But the company faces stiff competition, with titans in the realms of both tech and finance seeking to capitalize on growth in the buy now, pay later industry. Apple is set to launch its own BNPL product, Apple Pay Later, this fall, which will allow users to split the cost of their purchases over four equal monthly payments. Meanwhile, proposals are afoot to bring the BNPL market under regulatory supervision. In the U.K., the government has announced plans to enforce tighter affordability checks and a crackdown on misleading advertisements. Stateside, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau opened a market-monitoring probe into BNPL companies."},

Speaking to CNBC's \" Street Signs Asia\" on Wednesday, Sanjay Kapoor, who is now an independent analyst, said Indian mobile operator Reliance Jio's $25 billion plan to launch 5G network across the country indicates that India is \"very serious\" about 5G. 5G refers to the fifth generation of high-speed mobile internet which offers super-fast download speeds and more bandwidth that's capable of supporting technologies like driverless cars and virtual reality applications, including the metaverse. According to Reuters, Reliance is making a push to roll out its network within two months. It is also developing an affordable 5G smartphone with Google, according to the report. \"But when you look at what's happening \u2026 [in] China, for example, a single operator puts in more than $15 [billion], $16 billion every year, and they've been doing it for the last couple of years,\" said Kapoor. \"From an international perspective, [$25 billion] seems pretty okay. But in India, it looks really colossal.\" In July, India kicked off its 5G auction ahead of a planned 2023 rollout. Bidders include three of the country's major mobile operators in India \u2014 Reliance Jio, the market leader, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea \u2014 as well as Indian billionaire Gautam Adani's Adani Enterprises. Kapoor said the battle for the 72 gigahertz of 5G spectrum will be a \"two-horse race\" between Reliance and Bharti Airtel. \"They will be neck-to-neck [and] the strategies might differ,\" he added. Reliance Industries' Jio deposited 140 billion rupees of earnest money with the Indian government in July \u2014 it was the largest sum among the contenders. The amount of earnest money deposited is an indication of the amount of spectrum a company wishes to buy. Bharti Airtel deposited 55 billion rupees, while Vodafone Idea put in an earnest money deposit of 22 billion rupees. Reliance may have had a first-mover's advantage with its recent announcement, but Bharti Airtel's postpaid customer base could give it an edge over its rival, Kapoor said. However, what customers really value is their experience with a service provider, he pointed out. \"Therefore, each one of them will have to strive for supremacy in the market to make sure that they have a positive customer experience and are able to be competitive and world-class.\" But India's 5G infrastructure still has some way to go before that can happen, according to Kapoor. \"To give a sizable rollout in a country as large as India, it's not going to be very easy,\" he said. \"Do we have completely fiberized sites? China, for example, has a million sites already \u2026 and we [have] roughly, to each operator, about 250,000 sites.\" He added that India is going to need \"a lot more\" fiberized sites before it can give coverage to every nook and corner. Fibre infrastructure is the backbone of ultra-fast 5G networks, where a large availability of fiber-optic cables are required. \"To the time when we really can boast about giving a great customer experience, I think we are two, three years away,\" Kapoor said."},

The e-commerce platform is warning merchants who try to install Amazon's \"Buy With Prime\" button on their storefront that it violates Shopify's terms of service, and is also raising the specter of security risks, according to research firm Marketplace Pulse. Amazon introduced Buy With Prime in April, pitching it as a way for merchants to grow traffic on their own websites. The service lets merchants add the Prime logo and offer Amazon's speedy delivery options on their sites. Members of the retail giant's Prime loyalty club can check out using their Amazon account. Shopify will not protect merchants who try to use Buy With Prime against fraudulent orders, according to a screenshot of a notice Shopify sent to merchants. The notice also warns that Amazon's service could steal customer data, and charge customers incorrectly. Shopify's terms of service require merchants to use Shopify Checkout \"for any sales associated with your online store.\" Merchants can use checkout integrations that are part of Shopify's payments platform. In order to be part of the payments platform, providers have to agree to Shopify's Partnership Program Agreement and API terms. Buy With Prime competes directly with Shopify's instant checkout and payment service, Shop Pay. Shopify has sought to expand the feature beyond its own platform, striking deals with Facebook and Google last year to let customers use the system to make purchases. Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke welcomed the launch of Buy With Prime at the time of Amazon's announcement, saying the company was \"happy\" to integrate the feature into its platform. \"This fits perfectly into our world view,\" Lutke told investors on the company's first-quarter earnings call. \"And it's not nearly as zero-sum as some people make it out to be.\" Privately, Shopify may not have been as pleased about Buy With Prime. The Information reported in May that the launch sparked internal debate about whether Shopify should integrate the feature on its site. Additionally, a Shopify spokesperson told the publication that Lutke's comments only represented his opinion, adding that the company needed to gather more details before ruling on the issue. A Shopify spokesperson told CNBC in a statement: \"Shopify believes it's a good thing when a company like Amazon opens their infrastructure to more independent businesses to succeed in commerce.\" Shopify has become a popular alternative for sellers who are looking to sell products online, or diversify beyond Amazon. The Canadian company got its start providing businesses with software to help them build a presence online. Shopify in May acquired third-party fulfillment service Deliverr, putting it more directly in competition with Amazon's logistics arm. In response to Shopify's claims that Buy With Prime is insecure, an Amazon spokesperson said: \"We protect information collected via Buy with Prime, including shopper data, in accordance with Amazon's high security standards. We use this information to provide and improve Buy with Prime for merchants and shoppers.\" \"We use Amazon Pay to process payments for Buy with Prime orders. Amazon Pay is backed by the fraud protection technology used on Amazon.com,\" they added. \"Merchants have complete control over the prices customers are charged.\" Shopify said its terms of service are intended to protect merchants, and violations may trigger a warning.

But with interest rates rising and inflation stuck near a 40-year high, one part of the tech sector is still showing booming demand: cybersecurity. Earnings reports this week from CrowdStrike and SentinelOne pleasantly surprised Wall Street, and both companies, which specialize in protecting the many devices attached to corporate networks, boosted their forecasts for the year. \"Cybersecurity is not a discretionary line item,\" CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said on his company's earnings call. Investors heard similar commentary last week from Palo Alto Networks, which reported a profit for the first time in a decade. The data center security company's stock soared 12%, its best performance since its IPO in 2012. And two weeks ago, Cisco said its security business grew faster than all other segments, surpassing analysts' estimates by about $100 million. Security is now Cisco's top investment area, CEO Chuck Robbins told analysts on a conference call, and the company is staffing up as it raises prices to counter higher costs of components it needs to assemble hardware. Across the security landscape, vendors are busy providing tools to big companies concerned about vulnerabilities that have emerged due to the remote work and hybrid phenomenon and an increase in cyber attacks lodged while Russia is at war in Ukraine. \"In transformational projects, the vast majority of our customers continue on their investments here, despite the expected short-term macro impacts,\" Nikesh Arora, CEO of Palo Alto Networks, said on the call with analysts. \"Security spending is tied into our customers' desires to move to the cloud, drive more direct relationship with their customers, modernize their IT infrastructure, as well as drive efficiencies while adapting to a new way of working. Those efforts continue.\" Investors haven't made money on the security bet this year, but they've lost less than if they'd wagered on the broader tech market. Cyber-focused exchange-traded funds from First Trust Nasdaq and Global X (ticker symbol BUG) are down 22% and 19%, respectively, in 2022. The Nasdaq has dropped 25% for the year. Within software, security providers are showing the advantage they enjoy during a period of economic turmoil. Clients can't reduce their spending given the myriad of threats they face and the risks to their business if they're hit with a big ransomware attack. So they're looking elsewhere. Last week, cloud-software maker Salesforce trimmed its fiscal-year guidance and said customers had become more deliberate about purchases. The stock slid 11% over the next three trading sessions. Shares of Zoom also tumbled after the video-calling software company reduced its projections for the full year. Elsewhere in technology, ad-supported businesses like Snap and Facebook have gotten pummeled, while online commerce companies Shopify and Affirm warned of a return to pre-Covid spending patterns. Even Apple CEO Tim Cook said the iPhone marker sees\"pockets of softness\" as fears of an economic slowdown percolate. \"I don't know that anybody's using the recession word,\" said Gary Steele, CEO of Splunk, whose software helps companies analyze data to monitor performance and spot threats, in an interview this week. \"I just think that we saw macro conditions where budgets seemed to be tightening, meaning they had to make a decision about when they wanted something to happen.\" Second-quarter revenue at CrowdStrike rose 58% from a year earlier as the company signed up over 1,700 subscribing clients, more than in any previous quarter. Burt Podbere, CrowdStrike's finance chief, said the company was enjoying \"strong industry tailwinds.\" Kurtz told analysts that it's taking longer to do some deals because clients are being forced to get higher levels of required approvals before making purchases. But they're still happening. Jefferies was one of several banks to raise its price target on CrowdStrike, and analysts at the firm said the company should be reasonably sheltered in the case of a recession. SentinelOne CEO Tomer Weingarten touted his company's record-high gross margin and customer retention rate. \"Cybersecurity remains a top priority for enterprise IT spending, a must-buy for all enterprises,\" he said. Palo Alto's Arora said clients signed up for long-term deals during the quarter. That lines up with commentary from Guggenheim analysts, who wrote in a note to clients that security spending among companies they cover hasn't moderated as much as IT spending. Not all companies in the space are seeing a pop. Okta shares tumbled 33% on Thursday, after the provider of secure sign-on software cited a \"weakening economy\" and said it was struggling to integrate salespeople from Auth0, which it acquired last year for $6.5 billion. \"Integrations are always difficult and touch every part of an organization,\" CEO Todd McKinnon said on the earnings call. \"While we are making progress, we've experienced heightened attrition within the go-to-market organization, as well as some confusion in the field, both of which have impacted our business momentum.\" WATCH: Security and data are strong trends in small cloud companies, says Cohesity CEO Sanjay Poonen"},

In the smartphone field, companies ranging from Apple to Samsung have designed their own custom processors to differentiate from competitors and create better products than they might have using off-the-shelf chips. A focus on custom chips by Meta makes sense as it looks to differentiate its headsets and possibly create unique experiences for users. \"Unlike mobile phones, building virtual reality brings novel, multi-dimensional challenges in spatial computing, cost, and form factor,\" Zuckerberg said. \"These chipsets will help us keep pushing virtual reality to its limits and deliver awesome experiences.\" The length of the deal between the companies and financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

On Friday, the company launched the mid-range Honor 70 smartphone in Europe and said an unannounced foldable phone will be coming to the region and other international markets too in the future. It will be the first time Honor launches a foldable device overseas, the company said. Honor faces an uphill battle outside of China where it has less than a 1% smartphone market share. The brand was sold by Huawei to a consortium of Chinese buyers in late 2020 as a way to survive U.S. sanctions. In 2019 and 2020, Huawei was hit by a number of American sanctions that cut its access to Google software and key chips, destroying its smartphone business. Since then, Honor has launched a number of smartphones. This year, it brought its flagship Magic 4 handset to international markets. Alongside the upcoming foldable phone, Honor is placing emphasis on the more expensive premium end of the smartphone market outside of China. That will put Honor in competition with Samsung's latest foldables \u2014 the Galaxy Z Flip 4 and Galaxy Z Fold 4. \"As the global economy has deteriorated in 2022, the premium end has remained strong, benefitting Samsung and Apple so far this year,\" James Manning Smith, senior analyst at CCS Insight, told CNBC via email. \"One of Honor's greatest challenges in the year will be trying to leverage this trend, attempting to win sales from well-established premium brands, particularly in a year where stretched budgets will result in consumers looking to avoid potentially more risky purchases.\" Shipments of phones costing over $1,000 grew 94% year-on-year in the second quarter, according to Counterpoint Research. This segment is dominated by Apple and Samsung. But Honor's Chinese rivals including Xiaomi, Oppo and Realme have also managed to gain share overseas by managing to pump out mid-priced devices with high specs. That will pose another challenge to Honor. Honor's \"low-cost Chinese peers have made some serious in-roads in the European market over the last two years, a position that they will not give up without a fight,\" Smith added. \"Although Honor has been ramping up its marketing, it faces some incredibly fierce competition outside of China.\""},

It's a win for the company after it warned Wednesday that new export restrictions could hamper its operations in the country. Nvidia said in an SEC filing Wednesday that the U.S. government is restricting sales of high-performance AI chips for servers, the A100 and H100, to China and Russia. Sales of both chips are still restricted in those markets, though it can still develop the H100 in China. Nvidia expects a $400 million hit to revenue in the current quarter from new export restrictions. The company's stock fell nearly 9% in trading Thursday. \"The U.S. government has authorized exports, reexports, and in-country transfers needed to continue NVIDIA Corporation's, or the Company's, development of H100 integrated circuits,\" Nvidia said in a filing Thursday. The Biden administration is working to limit U.S. exports of certain semiconductors and equipment because of fears that Chinese companies could use them for military purposes. Graphics processors like the kind that Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices make are well suited for artificial intelligence applications that could include weapons development, facial recognition and other military uses. The H100 is Nvidia's upcoming enterprise AI chip that was previously expected to ship by the end of the year. Part of its development takes place in China. The A100 is an older model that has been shipping for three years. They are both graphics processors that can be used for supercomputing and artificial intelligence. Nvidia's data center business, which includes sales of the A100 and H100, is one of the fastest-growing parts of the company, reporting $3.8 billion in sales in the June quarter, a 61% annual increase. However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang warned analysts in August that Chinese cloud companies were slowing down building out their data centers and that China was a \"very large market\" for the company. Nvidia said Thursday that it can continue to ship AI chips from its Hong Kong facility through September 2023. \"The Chinese hyperscalers and the Chinese Internet companies really, really slowed down infrastructure investment this year, particularly starting in -- they've been rather slow in building out and really accelerate -- well, really slowed down in Q2,\" Huang said. Some analysts believe that Nvidia can ameliorate the impact of the new export restrictions by working with the government, although it's unclear whether the Chinese government might retaliate with its own bans. \"While there are potential near and intermediate term risks from the export ban, Nvidia is working closely with the [U.S. government] to navigate through the situation and we believe the USG is fully aware of the critical/strategic importance of Nvidia's accelerated compute platform to the global tech industry,\" JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur wrote in a note Thursday. The Department of Commerce said the new export restrictions are related to national security, but it didn't answer follow-up questions about whether it clarified or changed the policy for Nvidia. \"While we are not in a position to outline specific policy changes at this time, we are taking a comprehensive approach to implement additional actions necessary related to technologies, end-uses, and end-users to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests,\" a Department of Commerce representative said Wednesday. AMD also said Wednesday that it received new license requirements from the Department of Commerce, but did not expect them to materially affect its business because of lower China exposure.

{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/01/why-arms-lawsuit-against-qualcomm-is-a-big-deal.html", "title": "Why Arm's lawsuit against Qualcomm is a big deal", "paragraphs": " Arm is suing Qualcomm, putting two of the most valuable semiconductor firms into direct conflict, and raising questions about the future of the partnership between the two firms. The lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, comes at a critical time for Arm as its owner Softbank hopes to soon list the firm on public markets after a deal to sell it to Nvidia fell through because of regulatory scrutiny. But the suit also threatens Qualcomm's expansion plans, as it was hoping to use Nuvia processor designs at the heart of the dispute to compete more directly with Apple's chips for iPhones and Macs, and possibly use them to crack the server chip market, a lucrative space dominated by Intel and AMD. Nuvia was founded by ex-Apple chip designers and Qualcomm spent $1.4 billion to acquire it in 2021. Qualcomm's current Snapdragon chips for smartphones are also based on Arm technology. Arm is seeking damages and to force Qualcomm to destroy information and hardware from the Nuvia acquisition including chips, dies, packaging and promotional materials. The dispute centers around the rights to develop a chip using Arm's instruction set architecture (ISA), a core piece of intellectual property with origins dating back to 1985 that outlines how a chip performs basic functions like accessing memory or basic arithmetic. Arm-based chips have been ascendant in recent years because they're more power-efficient than the x86-based chips made by Intel and AMD. Over 29 billion chips based on Arm technology were shipped in 2021, including the chips at the heart of Apple's iPhones, Macs and iPads. Some companies, like Apple, license the ISA from Arm, then design their own physical processor circuits to implement the ISA instructions. Other companies, like Qualcomm historically, also buy the rights to full core designs from Arm, marketed as Cortex. Arm reported $2.7 billion in sales from licensing and royalties in 2021. The suit highlights the tension between Arm's business licensing the underlying intellectual property to make processors that could compete with the company's own designs. Arm said last year that it considered Qualcomm to be a competitor and that architectural licenses pose a threat to its implementation business. Lawsuits over intellectual property and contracts in the semiconductor industry are common. But the Arm-Qualcomm lawsuit is a significant conflict over the ability to design the kind of chip at the heart of nearly every smartphone in the world. It could have significant ramifications for chip startups and could open up a path to adoption for open-source alternatives to Arm. Qualcomm general counsel Ann Chaplin said in a statement that the dispute was a departure from a \"longstanding, successful relationship.\" \"Arm has no right, contractual or otherwise, to attempt to interfere with Qualcomm's or NUVIA's innovations,\" Chaplin said. \"Arm's complaint ignores the fact that Qualcomm has broad, well-established license rights covering its custom-designed CPUs, and we are confident those rights will be affirmed.\" Meanwhile, Arm said in a statement that the company was \"left with no choice other than to bring this claim against Qualcomm and Nuvia to protect our IP, our business, and to ensure customers are able to access valid Arm-based products.\" Qualcomm bought Nuvia because it wanted its chips to have better performance than what it could do with an off-the-shelf Arm processor design, especially to compete with Apple's high-efficiency custom Arm cores. Nuvia, a startup founded by former Apple and Google engineers, was developing a server chip with custom cores under an architecture license. It also had access to Arm's core designs. After the acquisition, Qualcomm placed Nuvia at the heart of its smartphone and PC strategy, using the startup's cores to make its laptop processors more competitive with Apple's M-series chips in products launching as soon as 2023. Qualcomm was also pitching Nuvia-based cloud processors to cloud providers such as Amazon, according to Bloomberg News. Arm says in its lawsuit that Nuvia's architectural license didn't transfer to Qualcomm when it bought it. Qualcomm has an architectural license, Arm says, but needed Arm's consent to purchase and use Nuvia's custom core designs. Arm terminated its Nuvia licenses in March, it said. If that holds in court, Qualcomm's entire chip strategy could be in flux. There may be an alternative route, however. Karl Freund, founder and analyst at Cambrian AI Research, speculated that Qualcomm could try to use RISC-V, an open source alternative to Arm's instruction set. Arm told regulators in December that \"RISC-V's momentum is accelerating\" and that established vendors are increasingly using it instead of Arm's instruction set. A few startups are currently building CPU cores based on RISC-V, but it has yet to be used in high-volume smartphones, which all currently use Arm. Arm's efforts to enforce its intellectual property with long-term partners, however, will likely prompt companies building custom Arm cores to take another look at open-source alternatives."},

Chipmaker Nvidia's shares have plunged around 13% this week after the company disclosed new U.S. restrictions on its exports to China, affecting about $400 million in potential sales in the current quarter. In China, the Nvidia Drive Orin chip has become a core part of electric automakers' assisted driving tech. These semi-autonomous driving systems are an important selling point for the companies in what has become a fiercely competitive market in China. Some automakers are also using Nvidia's Xavier chip. Automotive is a relatively small but fast-growing part of Nvidia's business. However, the new U.S. restrictions target Nvidia's A100 and H100 products \u2014 and these chips' sales are part of the company's far larger data center business. The products are graphics processors that can be used for artificial intelligence. \"There shouldn't be any restrictions on Xavier and Orin, and Xpeng, Nio and others would continue to ship with those chips,\" said Bevin Jacob, partner at Shanghai-based investment and consulting firm Automobility. Jacob, however, did warn that there could be \"close scrutiny\" in the future on U.S. firms shipping chips relating to artificial intelligence and autonomous driving to China. Xpeng declined to comment. Nio, Li Auto, Huawei and Jidu \u2014 a new electric vehicle brand backed by Baidu and Geely \u2014 did not respond to requests for comment. The new U.S. rules are designed to reduce the risk of supporting the Chinese military, according to the U.S. government, Nvidia said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. But it's unclear what prompted this specific policy move or what could drive future ones. In another positive sign for the chipmaker, the U.S. will allow Nvidia to continue developing its H100 artificial intelligence chip in China, the company said Thursday. \"The U.S. government has authorized exports, reexports, and in-country transfers needed to continue NVIDIA Corporation's, or the Company's, development of H100 integrated circuits,\" Nvidia said in a filing Thursday. The company said second-quarter revenue for its automotive business was $220 million, up 45% from a year earlier. \"Our automotive revenue is inflecting, and we expect it to be our next billion-dollar business,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in an earnings call in late August, according to a StreetAccount transcript. WeRide, an autonomous driving technology start-up, said in a statement that \"there is no immediate impact from the ban.\" \"We believe both the supply and demand side in the industry will work closely together to handle the constantly changing business environment to safeguard the continuous development of technology,\" the company said in a statement to CNBC. Pony.ai, another autonomous driving start-up, said it is not affected, as did automaker Geely. \u2014 CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report."},

Two years later, they shared their first kiss outside an Amazon seller summit in New Orleans. And in 2020, Gao left her home in Los Angeles to move in with Levine in Chicago, bringing their e-commerce businesses under one roof. So it only made sense that when it came time to tie the knot, they turned to e-commerce for their inspiration. On Aug. 21, the couple tied the knot in Chicago, and the wedding reception was filled with Amazon paraphernalia. At the reception, guests were seated at tables designated by a ten-digit code used to look up products on Amazon's website (known as an ASIN in seller parlance). Wedding favors were tiny Amazon packages, complete with barcodes and filled with treats, placed in miniature shopping carts. Attendees posed for photos in front of a backdrop declaring \"Jeddie (a combination of the couples' first names) Prime Day,\" an homage to Amazon's annual summer shopping bonanza. Although the references were a little bit esoteric, at least the couple was confident that some of their guests would understand them. Levine gave a toast during the reception. \"I said, 'Last but certainly not least, e-commerce brought us together. If we have met you as a result of e-commerce, directly or indirectly, stand up,\" he told CNBC in an interview. \"Literally half of our guests stood up.\" Not everyone got it, though. \"The bartender was like, 'Can you tell me what the deal is with all the Amazon-inspired stuff?,\" said Robyn Johnson, CEO of digital marketing agency Marketplace Blueprint, and a friend of the couple who attended the wedding. Both Levine and Gao have worked in e-commerce for more than a decade. Levine is president and co-founder of Hub Dub, which helps brands manage their businesses online and provides logistics services. Gao runs an Amazon business selling home d\u00e9cor products. Levine and Gao are part of an active community of sellers, consultants and service providers that's sprung up around Amazon's third-party marketplace. Launched in 2000, the marketplace has become a centerpiece of its dominant e-commerce business, as it now accounts for more than half of online retail sales. As of 2021, there were more than six million third-party sellers worldwide on the Amazon marketplace, according to research firm Marketplace Pulse. Gao met Levine at an Atlanta conference through a consultant who was helping her with her Amazon business, and who also happened to be Levine's friend. They didn't hit it off right away. But over the following months, Gao and Levine continued to run into each other on the e-commerce conference circuit and developed a friendship. Their friendship turned romantic in June 2018 at Amazon's Boost conference for third-party sellers in New Orleans. The conference coincided with Gao's 29th birthday, so she invited Levine and some of their friends out for a night of barhopping in New Orleans' historic French Quarter. That night, they kissed for the first time. On the last day of the conference, they went for a long walk through the streets of New Orleans, a memory they both half-jokingly describe as their \"five-hour marriage contract.\" \"We were contracting where we're going to live, the family we're going to bring, the religion we're going to have in the household, education,\" Gao said. \"We were lining it up.\" \"Based on five hours of back and forth, we found we were at least a decent match,\" Levine added. A few days later, Levine flew from Chicago to Los Angeles for their first date. He returned to Chicago the following day in time for a 10-day trip in Europe. They continued dating long-distance for the next two years, until June 2020. It was the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, and they could no longer safely hop on a plane for their bi-weekly visits. They decided it was the right time to move in together, and Levine proposed to Gao at Niagara Falls that September. Levine was the one who came up with the idea for an Amazon-inspired wedding. \"We went through all these ideas, and they were so boring,\" Levine said. \"I wanted something that showcased our background and gave homage to where we came from.\" Levine, who is Jewish, chose Jeff Cohen, an Amazon employee who previously worked for Seller Labs, which held the conference where they met, to serve as a witness when they signed their wedding contract, known as the ketubah. And guests who helped connect the couple at Amazon events had special \"matchmaker\" signs on the back of their chairs. They jokingly toyed with the idea of turning their wedding into a full-blown Amazon conference, with a software company offering, in jest, to sponsor the event. \"I said, 'No, I am not getting you a booth at our wedding,\" Levine said."},

Employees are turning to gadgets to outsmart monitoring software. One such tool is a mouse mover, or mouse jiggler, that's supposed to keep your screen on. I decided to give one a try to see if it works. I learned about mouse jigglers on TikTok. A mouse mover is a device that claims to be undetectable by your computer. As the name indicates, the device simulates mouse movement, preventing your computer from going into sleep mode. So-called \"tattleware,\" or surveillance software, is being installed on company-issued devices to track employee screen time, keyboard usage, and clicks. The mouse jiggler may not help with keyboard usage or clicks, but it should address screen time monitoring by keeping your computer's display on. Here's how a mouse jiggler works. I ordered a $30 Vaydeer Mouse Jiggler off Amazon and tested it out for a day. It took less than a minute to set up. You simply plug the power cord into the USB port on your computer, or attach it to the power brick and plug it into the wall. Use the wall for power if you're paranoid. You probably don't want to plug any type of device that helps you avoid work directly into a work-owned computer, especially since USB ports open up a whole host of security concerns, too. There's an orange power button on the left side that you can press to turn it on and off. A turntable moves when it's on. That's where you place the mouse's sensor. Once your mouse is in the right position, you'll begin to see the cursor on your screen move very slowly, keeping your monitor from going to sleep. That's pretty much all there is to it. Once your mouse is on the jiggler you can get up, make lunch, do whatever you need, and your computer won't go to sleep. It won't make you more productive, of course, but it may trick some surveillance software into thinking you're still working, at least if that software is checking to see if your computer is active. We shouldn't need these gadgets in the first place, though. I was surprised to learn employer surveillance is more common than I thought. A recent examination by The New York Times found that 80% of the 10 largest private U.S. employers track the productivity metrics of individual workers. And secretly monitoring employees makes them more likely to break the very rules these systems are trying to deter, according to a recent study by Harvard Business Review. Transparency is key to keeping worker morale up. Explaining the scope and purpose of monitoring can boost employees' acceptance of the practice by about 70%, according to a recent study by Gartner, a management consultant company."},

In April, more than 2,600 workers at Amazon's warehouse in Staten Island, known as JFK8, voted to join the Amazon Labor Union, becoming the first group to vote in favor of unionizing at one of the e-commerce giant's U.S. facilities. Amazon in May sought to overturn the results of the election. It submitted a filing to the NLRB accusing the federal agency's Brooklyn office of violating labor law by appearing to support the union drive. Amazon, which included 25 objections in its filing, also alleged that labor organizers intimidated workers to vote in their favor. Amazon's objections kicked off 24 days of hearings held via Zoom where lawyers for the company, NLRB's Region 29 office, and the ALU dissected conduct during the election. JFK8 workers and union organizers, including Chris Smalls, co-founder and interim president of the ALU, were among the more than a dozen witnesses called to testify. Lisa Dunn, the NLRB attorney presiding over the hearing, concluded in a filing Thursday that Amazon \"had not met its burden\" of establishing the agency, the union or any other parties \"engaged in objectionable conduct affecting the results of the election,\" NLRB spokesperson Kayla Blado said. Dunn also recommended ALU be certified as bargaining representative, Blado said. Amazon has until Sept. 16 to file objections to Dunn's recommendations, which will then be heard by a regional director of the NLRB. The regional director will determine whether to order a new union election, or certify the results of the April election, at which point Amazon will be required to start contract negotiations with the ALU. The union said in a statement that it's pleased with the hearing officer's recommendations. \"It is our hope that the Regional Director for Region 28 can expedite our certification and that the NLRB enforces Amazon's legal obligation to negotiate with the workers of the ALU,\" the union said in a release posted to Twitter. Representatives from Amazon and the NLRB didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The ALU, a grassroots organization of current and former Amazon employees, has sought to expand its reach beyond JFK8. The union in May failed to replicate its successful union campaign at another Staten Island warehouse, but it has gained traction elsewhere. Workers at an Amazon warehouse near Albany are seeking to be represented by the ALU. The NLRB has yet to set a date for that election. A Kentucky Amazon warehouse has also expressed interest in organizing under ALU. WATCH: How two friends formed Amazon's first U.S. union and what's next"},

Some 220 solar panels and other equipment at the facility, known as FAT1, were damaged by the three-alarm fire, which was caused by \"an undetermined electrical event within the solar system mounted on top of the roof,\" Leland Wilding, Fresno's fire investigator, wrote in an incident report. A little over a year later, about 60 firefighters were called to an even larger Amazon facility in Perryville, Maryland, to put out a two-alarm blaze, local news outlets reported. In the intervening months, at least four other Amazon fulfillment centers caught fire or experienced electrical explosions due to failures with their solar energy-generating systems, according to internal company documents viewed by CNBC. The documents, which have never been made public, indicate that between April 2020 and June 2021, Amazon experienced \"critical fire or arc flash events\" in at least six of its 47 North American sites with solar installations, affecting 12.7% of such facilities. Arc flashes are a kind of electrical explosion. \"The rate of dangerous incidents is unacceptable, and above industry averages,\" an Amazon employee wrote in one of the internal reports. The solar snafus underscore the challenge Amazon and many other large corporations face in their quest to shrink their environmental footprint and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Amazon has been among the most aggressive. In 2019, founder Jeff Bezos launched the Climate Pledge, promising the largest online retailer would zero out emissions by 2040, embrace renewable energy and move away from gas-guzzling delivery vans, including through a billion-dollar-plus investment in electric vehicle company Rivian. Corporate America is under pressure from regulators and a growing subset of investors to set and report on environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals. Many will be able to reap financial rewards for renewable energy efforts after Congress in August passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes climate provisions projected to reduce the country's carbon emissions by roughly 40% by 2030. Commercial solar in the U.S. is expected to see 8% annual growth over the next five years, thanks in part to the legislation, according to Wood Mackenzie solar analyst Michelle Davis. Warehouses can take outsized advantage of solar, she said, because they have large roofs and the systems can power all the HVAC, refrigeration and other energy-heavy systems located inside. But costly and dangerous issues can arise. By June of last year, all of Amazon's U.S. operations with solar had to be taken offline temporarily, internal documents show. The company had to ensure its systems were designed, installed and maintained properly before \"re-energizing\" any of them. Amazon spokesperson Erika Howard told CNBC in a statement that the incidents involved systems run by partners, and that the company responded by voluntarily turning off its solar-powered roofs. \"Out of an abundance of caution, following a small number of isolated incidents with onsite solar systems owned and operated by third parties, Amazon proactively powered off our onsite solar installations in North America, and took immediate steps to re-inspect each installation by a leading solar technical expert firm,\" the statement said. Those details didn't show up in Amazon's 100-page sustainability report for 2021, which was published at the beginning of August. In that report, available to the public via Amazon's sustainability website, the company said rooftop solar was powering 115 of its fulfillment centers across the globe by the end of 2021, up from more than 90 in the middle of the year. The majority of those are outside the U.S. \"Many of our fulfillment facilities throughout the U.S., Europe, and India are powered by on-site solar, where a rooftop installation can power up to 80% of the facility's energy use,\" the report said. By April of this year, Amazon had onsite solar at 176 facilities, according to its website. The solar program was launched in 2017. \"As inspections are completed, our onsite solar systems are being powered back on,\" Howard said. \"Amazon also built a team of dedicated solar experts overseeing the construction, operations, and maintenance of our systems in-house to ensure the safety of our systems.\" Excluded from the public sustainability report is any mention of the expenses Amazon incurs when there's a failure. An Amazon employee estimated, in the documents circulated internally, that each incident cost the company an average of $2.7 million. Costs included third-party audits of rooftop solar systems, checks on how much electricity they were generating and repairs for any broken or faulty parts of the systems that inspectors identified. The Amazon employee also said the company would lose $940,000 per month, or $20,000 for each of the 47 decommissioned North American sites, as long as the solar remained offline. There could be additional costs for Amazon depending on contracts with clean energy partners for renewable energy credits, the documents show. To date, Amazon has contracted with third-party vendors to design, then install solar photovoltaic systems on rooftops and big backup batteries on site. Other major retailers, including Walmart and Target, have also installed solar rooftops and adopted programs to trim their energy bills and reach sustainability goals. In addition to its warehouses, Amazon has some solar roof systems at its Whole Foods stores. Amazon and its auditor, Clean Energy Associates (CEA), put off inspection of the solar rooftop systems at Whole Foods locations until 2022, the documents said. As of late 2021, four years after acquiring Whole Foods, Amazon was still working to attain technical information about the renewable energy assets at the stores. To maintain tighter quality control of its solar energy systems, some Amazon employees recommended bringing more operations in-house. The fire in Perryville, Maryland, which was the sixth failure in a little over a year, spurred the company to take systematic action. On June 17, 2021, roughly a week after the fire at the warehouse known as MDT2, Amazon's sustainability division directed the owners and developers of solar rooftop systems on its U.S. warehouses to decommission them. The solar rooftops would no longer be generating electricity from the sun or producing renewable energy credits. Amazon then hired Denver-based CEA to conduct a third-party audit of its rooftop solar systems in the U.S., Asia-Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Late last year, while CEA was still conducting its inspections, it informed Amazon of one critical and 259 major findings across Amazon's rooftop solar portfolio. Problems included mismatched module-to-module connectors, improper installation of connectors, poor wire management and evidence of water intrusion in the inverters, internal documents said. Issues with inverters, which convert solar energy into usable electricity, were identified as the likely cause of a fire in at least one Amazon warehouse. Wilding, the Fresno fire inspector, concluded the blaze at FAT1 \"originated on or near two inverters,\" according to an investigation report obtained by CNBC through a request for public records. Amazon blamed third-party partners and vendors for the most significant problems uncovered by CEA and other teams working on facilities and sustainability initiatives. \"Over the past five years, solar malfunctions have been caused by improper installation techniques, improper commissioning of a new system, inadequate system maintenance and equipment malfunction,\" the documents said. Amazon teams working on facilities and sustainability initiatives devised a two-part plan to help prevent future breakdowns in the rooftop solar program. In late 2021, the divisions requested $3.6 million in funding to reinspect sites where major findings were identified in order to ensure the systems were safe to be brought back online, according to internal correspondence. Internal teams also began to urge Amazon leadership to rely more on salaried employees and less on outside vendors. Over time, the company hired more solar experts focused on procurement, design, construction and maintenance globally. In some cases, management was notably slow in responding. For example, the groups inside the company agitating for change went to leadership for approval on the hiring, re-inspection and re-energizing plans. But the efforts were held up for months by top Amazon executives, including Kara Hurst, vice president of worldwide sustainability, and Alicia Boler-Davis, senior vice president of global customer fulfillment, who left the company in June 2022, according to internal correspondence viewed by CNBC. Amazon disputed the claim in the documents that leadership was slow to address employee requests. Job openings suggest Amazon is still seeking to hire people internally for solar operations. The company was recently looking for someone to manage sustainability projects across its North American facilities, which include rooftop solar. There's a current listing for a technical program partner on the solar team says that a key aspect of the position is collaborating with \"internal partners\" in worldwide design, solar construction and sustainability, among other divisions. As it tries to staff up, Amazon has acknowledged that going green comes with hurdles, particularly for a company \"of the size and broad scope of Amazon.\" \"But at Amazon, we don't shy away from big challenges,\" Hurst wrote, in the letter kicking off the 2021 sustainability report. \"We don't have all the answers today, but we believe in the need to act now.\" WATCH: How two friends formed Amazon's first U.S. union and what's next"},

The website called Temu, which went online Thursday, lists items across a number of categories including clothing, jewelry, pet supplies and home and garden, and could mark a new challenge to U.S. e-commerce leader Amazon. Pinduoduo did not respond to a request for comment when contacted by CNBC. Temu marks Pinduoduo's biggest push overseas yet as the domestic Chinese economy faces a number of challenges from a resurgence of Covid-19 to an energy crunch. That has hurt economic growth in China and dampened consumer sentiment. China's biggest technology companies from Tencent to Pinduoduo's e-commerce rivals Alibaba and JD.com continue to pursue international markets. Pinduoduo, a much younger company than Alibaba and JD.com, having only been founded in 2015, is behind its rivals when it comes to the overseas push. Alibaba took a controlling stake in Singapore-based Southeast Asian e-commerce site Lazada in 2016 and has since invested money in the business to expand its presence in the region. Alibaba also has a separate website called AliExpress that services markets like Europe and the U.S. JD.com meanwhile operates Joybuy.com for international customers. Pinduoduo's Temu is a cross-border e-commerce website with most products likely to come from overseas, especially China. Temu said shipping to the U.S. could take 7-15 business days. \"It's important to keep in mind that you may see longer delivery times than you're used to from other e-commerce websites. This is due to the fact that items that may be coming from another country or need to be bundled or packaged with other similar-sized items,\" the website says on the shipping information page. Shipping is free for orders over $49. Pinduoduo could face some challenges in cracking the U.S. market. First it will need to build brand reputation versus the likes of Amazon. And it could also suffer from its relatively long shipping times versus the same-day or next-day deliveries Amazon offers via its Prime subscription services. Temu's \"main challenges will be cultivating trust and awareness among customers,\" Jacob Cooke, CEO of WPIC, an e-commerce tech and marketing firm that helps foreign brands sell in China, told CNBC. There are currently also some categories that have very few products. For example, the men's wristwatch category had just two products listed. However, Temu could compete on price. On Thursday, Temu had a 20% discount offer sitewide. And products appear to be quite cheap. For example, the women's dresses listed were mostly under $20. Temu could also have an advantage due to \"existing relationships with low-cost manufacturers in China that maybe haven't expanded to the U.S. yet,\" Cooke said. Pinduoduo has grown quickly in its seven-year history to become one of China's biggest e-commerce firms. The company has tended to focus on lower-income consumers by offering heavily discounted products. And it has been focusing on bringing agricultural products onto its platform to differentiate from rivals. The company is worth around $87 billion."},

Although monkeypox cases are still increasing nationally, the speed of the outbreak appears to be slowing, Walensky said. The U.S. has reported nearly 17,000 monkeypox cases since May, more than any other country in the world, according to CDC data. In New York City, which has reported more infections than any other jurisdiction, new monkeypox cases have dropped from more than 70 per day on average to nine as of Thursday, according to data from the city health department. Dr. Aswhin Vasan, the city health commissioner, said earlier this week the outbreak has slowed due to increased vaccination and community outreach efforts. New York City has reported a total of 2,888 monkeypox cases. In Chicago, another major epicenter of the outbreak, new cases have dropped from 141 during the week ended July 30 to 74 for the week ended Aug. 20, according to that city's health department. Chicago has reported a total of 807 cases. \"We're not seeing the potentially exponential growth that we were seeing early on so that is reassuring,\" said Dr. Allison Arwady, Chicago's public health commissioner, during a Facebook live event earlier this week. \"Too early to say things look really good, but definitely some signs of slowing of cases.\" The U.S. is nearing the point where the entire community of gay and bisexual men who currently face the greatest health risk from monkeypox rwill have access to two doses of the monkeypox vaccine, according to Dawn O'Connell, head of the office responsible for the national stockpile at the Health and Human Services Department. The CDC previously estimated that up to 1.7 million gay and bisexual men who are HIV-positive or are eligible for medicine to reduce their chance of contracting HIV face the greatest health risk from monkeypox. The U.S. has distributed 1.5 million doses of the monkeypox vaccine so far and more than 3 million doses should be available by when the latest distribution round is complete, according to O'Connell. To date, the outbreak is disproportionately affecting Black and Hispanic men. About 30% of monkeypox patients are white, 32% are Hispanic and 33% are Black, according to CDC data. Whites make up about 59% of the U.S. population while Hispanics and Blacks account for 19% and 13%, respectively. The monkeypox vaccine, called Jynneos in the U.S., is administered in two doses 28 days apart. The patients will not have full protection from the vaccine until two weeks after the second dose is administered, according to the CDC. Data from 19 jurisdictions show that nearly 97% of the shots administered so far were first doses, according to Walensky. About 94% of monkeypox cases are associated with sexual contact and nearly all of the people who have contracted the virus are men who have sex with men, according to Demetre Daskalakis, the deputy head of the White House monkeypox response team. A CDC survey of 824 gay and bisexual men found that 48% respondents have reduced their number of sexual partners and 50% have reduced one-time sexual encounters during the current outbreak. A separate CDC study found that a 40% decrease in one-time sexual encounters would reduce the final percentage of gay and bisexual men infected with monkeypox by up to 31%. \"We're actually seeing vaccine get out, behaviors change, harm-reduction messages being heard and implemented,\" Walensky said. \"And all of that working together to bend the curve.\" Correction: 33% of confirmed monkeypox cases are among Black Americans. A previous version of this story misstated the figure."},

Over the past two years, fall and winter have brought devastating Covid surges that took hundreds of thousands of lives and pushed hospitals to the breaking point. But U.S. health officials say the nation is in a much different place today due to the arsenal of tools doctors now have to fight the virus. \"We are in a much, much better place. We are in a better place because people have gotten vaccinated and boosted. We've got treatments that are widely available,\" Dr. Ashish Jha, White House Covid response coordinator, said in an August interview with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a report published in early August, said high levels of immunity in the U.S. population from vaccination and infection have substantially reduced the threat of hospitalization and death from Covid. The CDC ended its quarantine recommendations for people exposed to the virus last month. Public health officials are calling on people to stay up to date on their vaccines, but are largely leaving it up to individuals to decide what other precautions they should take based on their health history, risk tolerance and how much Covid is spreading in their communities. The CDC is taking a more targeted approach that focuses on making sure those at the highest risk of severe illness have access to vaccines, antiviral treatments and other therapeutics to protect their health. Many people haven't had a vaccine dose in months, which means their immune protection against the virus is waning off with some studies showing three shots of the original vaccines were just 19% effective at preventing Covid infection after five months. At the same time, more transmissible omicron subvariants are spreading. It's creating a perfect storm ahead of the cold weather months and holidays that force people indoors in close proximity to each other and a highly contagious airborne pathogen. Even with all the tools the U.S. has available, Covid infections, hospitalizations and deaths have plateaued at stubbornly high levels over the summer. The U.S. is gearing up for a booster campaign after Labor Day with reformulated vaccines that target both the original strain of the virus that emerged in Wuhan, China, in 2019 and omicron BA.5, the dominant variant in circulation. Public health officials believe the reformulated boosters will provide more durable protection against infection and help avert a major surge that taxes hospitals. \"It's going to be really, really important for people to get this updated, new, very specific Covid vaccine because I think it's going to help a lot in preventing infections, and I think it is going to help a lot in keeping people out of the hospital,\" Jha said. The U.S. has so far secured 171 million doses of Pfizer's and Moderna's new boosters shots that target omicron. The reformulated boosters could reduce infections by 2.4 million, hospitalizations by 137,000 and deaths by 9,700 from August through May of 2023 if a new variant doesn't emerge, according to a projection by a team of scientists who forecast the trajectory of the pandemic, called the Covid-19 Scenario Modeling Hub. But the projection is based on optimistic assumptions about booster coverage and efficacy, according to the scientists. The model assumes that the shots will prove 80% effective at preventing illness, the vaccination campaign will ramp up quickly and the public will broadly embrace the new boosters. But many people in the U.S. still haven't gotten their first booster with the old vaccine yet, and it's not clear that these individuals will be more willing to take the new shots. About 76% of people ages 12 and older have received their first two vaccine doses, according to CDC data. Out of those people, about half have gotten their third shot. It's also not clear how effective the new omicron boosters will be in the real world yet. The Food and Drug Administration authorized the shots on Wednesday without results from human trials on the BA.5 shots. But Dr. Peter Marks, head of the FDA office responsible for reviewing vaccines, said the available data suggests the shots will provide substantially better protection. Public health officials are working under the assumption that the U.S. will face some version of omicron in the fall, which is why the new vaccines target BA.5. But there is always the risk that a new variant outside the omicron lineage will emerge that can evade the new shots. If Covid mutates in a way that gives life to a new, dominant variant and boosters are slow to get out to the public, the U.S. could suffer 1.3 million hospitalizations and 181,000 deaths over the next nine months, according to the scientists' most pessimistic scenario. But Michael Osterholm, director of Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said the reality is that nobody really knows what will happen in the fall. \"We don't know,\" he said. Ali Mokdad, an epidemiologist at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, said his group is predicting a rise in Covid cases, deaths and hospitalizations this fall. \"But the rise in mortality and hospitalization will not be similar to what we have seen before, simply because most people have some kind of immunity against illness,\" Mokdad said. About 95% of people ages 16 and older in the U.S., in fact, have Covid antibodies of some sort \u2014 either from vaccination or prior infection, according to a CDC survey of blood donor data. This means more people in the U.S. have at least some protection against severe disease and death from Covid than at any other point in the pandemic. Previous infection, vaccination alone and vaccination plus infection didn't necessarily keep people from getting sick, but they all showed more than 70% effectiveness against developing a really severe case or dying from omicron BA.2 , according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Weill Cornell Medicine in Qatar. The study examined the medical records of 100,000 individuals in Qatar from December 2021 through February 2022. But the Qatar study may not translate well to the U.S. population, which has a large elderly population and many people with preexisting medical conditions, like obesity or diabetes. Qatar on the other hand has a very young population \u2014 only 9% of its residents are age 50 or older compared with more than a third of all Americans. Omicron has also continued to evolve into more transmissible and immune-evasive subvariants. The BA.5 subvariant became dominant this summer, pushing out BA.2. Though BA.5 has not been associated with more severe disease, it is more effective at evading immunity and infecting people who are vaccinated or who have recovered from Covid. \"BA.5 is the most contagious, certainly the most immune evasive variant we've seen,\" Jha told NBC News in July. \"That means if you were infected earlier this you're still at very high risk of reinfection. It means if you've not been vaccinated recently you have a very high risk of having a breakthrough.\" While the CDC previously thought that infection provided about 90 days of protection, Jha told reporters in July that breakthrough infections have become more common and are happening earlier with BA.5. He said it's unclear how long immunity lasts after recovering from a BA.5 infection. Osterholm said the pandemic has entered another unprecedented period. Previously, infections have surged to high peaks and then steeply declined before the next wave. But for the past three months, infections, hospitalizations and deaths have plateaued at a high level with no sign of another variant displacing BA.5, he said. \"We're seeing now more and more people are on their second and third episodes of this,\" Osterholm said. \"What is the interaction between increasing vaccination, natural infection and immunity related to infection? We just don't know,\" he said. It's unclear whether the current pattern of transmission will continue or if the U.S. will face another wave, Osterholm said. Right now, the U.S. is averaging more than 88,000 new infections daily, which is likely a vast undercount because people testing positive at home isn't picked up by the official data. More than 32,000 people total are hospitalized across the U.S. with Covid right now, and an average of nearly 400 people are still dying every day from the virus, according to data from the CDC and the Health and Human Services Department. That's a significant improvement from the peak of the outbreak in the winter of 2021 when more than 3,000 people died a day on average. Though milder today than those early days of the pandemic, Covid is still killing at four or five times the fatality rate of the flu, Jha told the Chamber. \"If everybody was up to date on their vaccines and people got treated with Paxlovid as they're supposed to deaths would go to close to zero across America,\" Jha said. Hospitalizations are down 75% and deaths are down 85% from the peak of last winter's omicron surge. But if deaths remain at their current level through next year, more than 140,000 people would succumb to the virus, which would still make Covid one of the 10 leading causes of death in the U.S. \"Will we continue to see this kind of activity maintained for some time? People will say it can't go on endlessly because people will be infected and develop immunity. But what happens with waning immunity?\" Osterholm said. Many elderly people and individuals with weak immune systems remain vulnerable to the virus. The rate of hospitalization and death from Covid has increased among those ages 65 and older since April despite high levels of vaccination in this age group, according to CDC data. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Brown University School of Public Health, said she is worried about the elderly and those with weak immune systems who are not up to date on their vaccines heading into the fall. Nuzzo said the public health response this fall should be laser focused on making sure these people are protected. \"I have some worry that unless we put that at the top of our list, our efforts are just going to be diluted, spread out over a number of different areas,\" Nuzzo said. \"If we fail to make sure the highest-risk people are fully protected, that's when we're going to see the deaths and that's the most important thing we could try to prevent.\" Although 92% of those ages 65 and older received the first two doses of the vaccine, many of them have not stayed up to date with their boosters. About 70% received their third dose and only 40% have gotten their fourth shot since the FDA authorized it in February. People ages 50 and older who received a second booster dose were 14 times less likely to die from Covid than the unvaccinated, and three times less likely to die than people who had one booster dose, according to CDC data. Dr. Paul Offit, an infectious disease expert at Children's Hospital Philadelphia, said people ages 75 and older, people with serious medical conditions and those with compromised immune systems would benefit the most from getting a booster right now. Deaths from Covid have risen in particular among people ages 75 and older, according to the CDC. The CDC has also emphasized the importance of using therapeutics to protect people who simply cannot mount a strong immune response to the virus even with vaccination. Nearly 3% of U.S. adults have compromised immune systems, or about 7 million people ages 18 or older, according a survey published in 2016 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The CDC has emphasized the importance of administering an investigational antibody therapy called Evusheld for people ages 12 and older with moderate and severely compromised immune systems. Evusheld is administered as two injections, before Covid infection, every six months to prevent severe illness, according to the FDA. But only 450,000 courses of the medicine have been administered so far, according to the Health and Human Services Department. \"The goal moving forward here for this year, next year, five years and 10 years down the road is protecting the vulnerable,\" Offit said."},

But booking airfare on a certain day of the week isn't one of them, according to data from Google Flights. Booking mid-week \u2014 and especially Tuesdays around midnight \u2014 is often cited as the best time to purchase flights. But in the past five years, U.S. airfares purchased on Tuesdays, Wednesday or Thursdays have been only 1.9% cheaper on average than airfares purchased during the weekend, according to Google Flights. \"If your trip is just a couple of weeks away, don't wait for Tuesday to roll around \u2014 book your flight now in case the price goes up,\" wrote James Byers, Google Flights' group product manager, on a blog post published yesterday. While the day of the week travelers book may not matter much, the day they fly does, according to Google Flights' research, which examined five years of historical flight data from Aug. 1, 2017 to Aug. 1, 2022. \"On average, flights that depart on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday have been 12% cheaper than weekend departures,\" wrote Byers. \"If you exclude international destinations, the potential savings jump even higher to 20%.\" Another common strategy \u2014 booking early \u2014 also works, according to the data. For U.S. domestic flights, airfares have been lowest between three and eight weeks before a departure date, with prices \"bottoming out\" 44 days out, according to the research. Non-stop flights cost on average about 20% more than connecting flights, according to Google Flights, but flights with stops also increase the risk of interruptions. An Instagram poll by the travel insurance company World Nomads indicated more than 1 in 3 respondents spent up to $250 on flights, meals or hotels because of flight delays or cancellations this summer, while 12% reported spending between $500 to $1,000. Travelers with flexible flying days can use Google Flights' \"date grid\" function to quickly ascertain the cheapest dates to depart and arrive in a given week. Those who want to travel for a specific duration \u2014 say, two weeks \u2014 but are flexible on when, can use the \"price graph\" function to see the cheapest times to fly too. Price tracking also eliminates the need to search again and again to price-check a desired route.

It is the first time the FDA has authorized an updated vaccine formula since the original shots rolled out in December 2020. Pharmacies are expected to start administering the new boosters after Labor Day weekend. The U.S. has secured 171 million doses of Pfizer's and Moderna's updated shots so far, according to the Health and Human Services Department. Pfizer's new booster dose is authorized for people ages 12 and older, while Moderna's new shots are authorized for adults ages 18 and older. The eligible age groups can receive the boosters two months after completing their primary series or their most recent booster with the old shots. The U.S. will no longer use the original vaccines as booster doses for individuals ages 12 and older now that the the updated shots have been authorized, according to the FDA. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has to sign off on the boosters before pharmacies can give them to patients. The CDC's independent advisory committee is scheduled to meet Thursday and Friday to review the data and issue its recommendations for health-care providers. Public health officials believe the redesigned boosters will provide longer-lasting protection against the virus and reduce hospitalizations this fall and winter. The new boosters target both the original strain that emerged in China more than two years ago, which scientists refer to as the \"wild type,\" and omicron BA.4 and BA.5, which are now the dominant variants in the U.S. Shots that target two different strains are called bivalent vaccines. The vaccine makers developed the original shots against the strain of Covid that first emerged in Wuhan, China, in 2019. But the virus has mutated dramatically since then. Omicron and its subvariants have drifted so much from the original Covid strain that the virus is able to slip past the protective antibodies induced by the vaccines. As a consequence, the shots' effectiveness at preventing infection and mild illness has declined substantially as the virus has evolved. Though the vaccines are still generally preventing severe disease, the protection they provide against hospitalization has slipped over time as well. \"There is declining effectiveness against hospitalization and severe illness. The problem has been persuading the American people to get boosted on a regular basis,\" said Dr. Peter Hotez, an infectious disease expert at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas. Hotez led a team that developed a Covid vaccine based on protein technology that is authorized in India. About 76% of people ages 12 and older have received their first two vaccine doses in the U.S., according to CDC data. About 50% of those individuals have received their first booster dose. For adults ages 18 and older, three doses of Pfizer's or Moderna's original vaccines were 55% effective at preventing hospitalization from the omicron BA.2 subvariant four months after the third shot, according to CDC data. Three shots were 19% effective at preventing infection from omicron five months after the third shot, according to CDC data from August 2021 through May 2022. The rapidly spreading BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants have since driven omicron BA.2 out of circulation. Dr. Peter Marks, head of the FDA office responsible for reviewing vaccines, said the hope is that the updated boosters will restore the high level of protection against disease that vaccines demonstrated when they were first authorized in December 2020. \"We don't know for a fact yet whether we will get to that same level, but that is the goal here. And that is what we believe the evidence that we've seen helps point to,\" Marks told reporters during a news conference after the authorization Wednesday. The Biden administration moved rapidly over the summer to get updated shots ready for the fall. Public health officials are worried the U.S. is on the verge of another wave of infection as more transmissible omicron variants spread, immunity from the original vaccines wears off, and people head indoors to escape colder weather. Pfizer and Moderna were originally developing boosters to target omicron BA.1, the variant that caused the massive wave of infection last winter. But the FDA told the vaccine makers in late June to switch gears and target BA.4 and BA.5 instead as those variants quickly gained ground. The sudden change in plans left little time for clinical trials in humans before a fall rollout. As a consequence, the authorization is based on human clinical trials from the BA.1 shots, which produced a better immune response than the original doses, according to the FDA. But it's unclear how the BA.5 boosters will perform in humans since the data is based on BA.1. Marks said it will likely be at least another two months before human clinical data on the BA.5 shots is made available to the public. The most common side effects from the human trials of the BA.1 shots was pain, redness, swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headaches, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea, vomiting and fever, according to the FDA. The Covid vaccines also have a well-established safety profile after administration to millions of people over the course of the pandemic, the FDA said. In addition to human data from the BA.1 shots, the authorization was also based on animal studies from the BA.5 boosters, Marks said. In June, Pfizer also presented data to the FDA's independent vaccine advisory committee that showed the bivalent omicron BA.5 shots increased antibodies in mice that protect against infection by about 2.6-fold compared with the original vaccine. Marks said the FDA used the same process for the authorization that it relied on in the past for switching the strains in flu vaccines. \"We're pretty confident that or what we have is very similar to the situation that we've done in the past with influenza changes where we don't do clinical studies for them in the United States,\" Marks said. \"We know from the way the vaccine works, and from the data that we have, that we can predict how well the vaccine will be working.\" But some infectious disease and vaccine experts say the FDA should have waited for human data from the BA.5 shots before authorizing them. Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA's advisory committee, said data based on mice studies is not sufficient to justify authorizing the new boosters. \"You have to show some evidence in people that the immune response that you're getting with the bivalent vaccine is clearly better, and those data haven't been presented,\" said Offit, an infectious disease and vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \"You can't ask millions of people to get this booster dose without showing some human data that you have a dramatic increase in neutralizing antibodies to the BA.4/BA.5 strains as compared to boosting with the ancestral type,\" Offit said, referring to the currently authorized shots based on the version of Covid that emerged in China, more than two years ago. Michael Osterholm, a leading epidemiologist and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, also said more data needs to be presented on how the BA.5 shots perform in humans. \"It's not that I don't think it could work,\" Osterholm said. \"But I think we need the data first to show that the immune response to this vaccine is equivalent to or better than what we have already.\" But CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, in a radio interview, said waiting longer for human data from the BA.5 shots could mean the boosters become outdated if a new variant emerges. Walensky said the change in the vaccine formula is small and should not affect safety. \"There's always a question here of being too slow versus too fast,\" Walensky told \"Conversations on Health Care\" in a radio interview. \"One of the challenges is if we wait for those data to emerge in human data [...] we will be using what I would consider to be a potentially outdated vaccine.\""},

But it's unclear how much protection the new booster shots will provide. The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cleared the shots without any data from clinical trials that are testing the reformulated doses in humans. The new boosters, authorized for people ages 12 and older, target the highly contagious and immune-evasive omicron BA.5 subvariant that has caused a wave of breakthrough infections over the summer. The shots also target the original strain of the virus that first emerged in Wuhan, China, in 2019. The nation's top health officials acted with urgency this summer to ensure the new boosters would roll out in time for the fall. They are worried that the waning effectiveness of the old vaccines is creating an opening for omicron to cause another wave of hospitalizations this winter as people spend more time indoors where the airborne virus spreads more easily. Deaths and hospitalizations have climbed since April among the elderly, the most vaccinated age group in America, as omicron has continued to mutate into more and more transmissible subvariants that dodge the protection of the original vaccines, according to Heather Scobie, a CDC epidemiologist. Dr. Peter Marks, who heads the FDA office that reviews vaccines, said the new boosters aim to restore the high levels of protection that vaccines demonstrated in early 2021. But Marks acknowledged that the federal government's experts simply do not know yet whether the boosters will meet the high bar set by those doses. \"We don't know for a fact yet whether we will get to that same level, but that is the goal here. And that is what we believe the evidence that we've seen helps point to,\" Marks told reporters during a news conference after the FDA authorization Wednesday. The FDA will conduct surveillance to see whether the boosters meet that goal, Marks said. When Pfizer's and Moderna's shots were authorized in December 2020, they provided more than 90% protection at preventing Covid. Marks told reporters it will likely take at least another couple of months before human data on the BA.5 boosters is available to the public. But he said the FDA used basically the same process to authorize the new boosters that it has relied on for years to switch the virus strains in flu shots. \"We're pretty confident that what we have is very similar to the situation that we've done in the past with influenza changes where we don't do clinical studies for them in the United States,\" Marks said. \"We know from the way the vaccine works, and from the data that we have, that we can predict how well the vaccine will be working.\" The new boosters could prevent 2.4 million infections, 137,000 hospitalizations and 9,700 deaths if a new variant doesn't emerge, according to a projection by a team of scientists that forecasts the trajectory of the pandemic, called the Covid-19 Scenario Modeling Hub. But that projection is based on optimistic assumptions about booster coverage and efficacy, according to the scientists. The model assumes that the shots will prove 80% effective at preventing illness and the public will broadly embrace the new boosters. There is no efficacy data on the new shots and it's unclear how strong public demand will be for them. The CDC estimates that an early fall vaccination campaign with boosters could save the U.S. between $63 billion and $109 billion in medical costs by preventing hospitalizations and ICU admissions. Pfizer and Moderna were originally developing new boosters to target the first version of omicron, BA.1, that caused the massive wave of infection and hospitalization last winter. But keeping up with the rapid evolution of the virus has proved challenging. By the time the nation's top health leaders moved in earnest in April to get new boosters ready, more transmissible subvariants had already driven omicron BA.1 out of prevalence. In June, the FDA asked the vaccine makers to switch gears and target omicron BA.5 after it rose to dominance. This decision did not leave enough time for Pfizer and Moderna to complete human clinical trials on the new boosters before a fall vaccine rollout. As a consequence, the FDA and the CDC are relying on human data from the clinical trials of the BA.1 shots to understand how the BA.5 boosters might perform. They also relied on data from studies in which the BA.5 boosters were tested in mice. The CDC's independent advisory committee backed the shots on Thursday in an overwhelming vote. But several members of the panel also had reservations about the lack of human data. \"I really do struggle with a vaccine that has no clinical data that's reported for humans, for those that would be actually receiving the vaccine,\" said Dr. Oliver Brooks, a committee member and the chief medical officer at Watts HealthCare Corp. in Los Angeles. Dr. Pablo Sanchez, the only CDC committee member who voted against the shots, called the decision to recommend the new boosters without human data premature. \"There's a lot of vaccine hesitancy already \u2014 we need the human data,\" said Sanchez, a professor of pediatrics at Ohio State University. Dr. Doran Fink, deputy head of the FDA's vaccine review division, told hesitant committee members that the new booster shots use the exact same manufacturing process as the old vaccines and contain the same total amount of mRNA, the code that instructs human cells to produce the proteins that provoke an immune response to defend against Covid. Fink said the BA.1 and the BA.5 shots are similar enough to use data from the BA.1 human trials to get a good idea of how the new BA.5 boosters will perform. Pfizer and Moderna presented data at the CDC meeting which showed that the BA.1 shots triggered a stronger immune response in humans than the old vaccines. The mouse studies from both companies on the BA.5 shots also showed a stronger immune response. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky last week said waiting longer for human data from the BA.5 shots could mean the boosters become outdated if a new variant emerges. \"There's always a question here of being too slow versus too fast,\" Walensky told \"Conversations on Health Care\" in a radio interview. \"One of the challenges is if we wait for those data to emerge in human data ... we will be using what I would consider to be a potentially outdated vaccine.\" Moderna completed enrollment in its clinical trials last week and expects results by the end of the year. Pfizer's clinical trials are ongoing, though the company hasn't provided a time frame on when it will have data. Brooks questioned why the FDA decided to go with a BA.5 vaccine when clinical data is available for the BA.1 shots that the vaccine makers were originally developing. Canada and the United Kingdom have authorized new booster shots that target omicron BA.1 Fink said the U.S. selected BA.5 based on the advice of the FDA's independent committee, data from South Africa that indicated natural infection from the subvariant provides broader protection than infection from BA.1, and the fact that BA.5 is dominant. Though the committee members had some hesitation about proceeding without the human data, they agreed the new boosters should have a similar safety profile to the old vaccines because they use the same platform. The Covid vaccines have been administered to millions of people in the U.S. with mostly mild side effects. The most common side effects from the human trials of the BA.1 shots was pain, redness, swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headaches, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea, vomiting and fever, according to the FDA. Dr. Sara Oliver, a CDC official, told the committee that the risk of myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, after a BA.5 booster is unknown. But health officials anticipate it will be similar to the risk observed with the old vaccines. Pfizer's and Moderna's vaccines have been associated with an elevated risk of myocarditis in young men and adolescent boys mostly after the second dose. But the risk of myocarditis is higher from Covid infection than vaccination, according to the CDC. Dr. Grace Lee, the CDC committee chair, sought to reassure the public that there's a robust surveillance system to monitor safety, and that the panel will meet again if any new concerns emerge. \"I just want to make sure that the members of the public are aware that we're continuing to monitor closely,\" Lee said. \"We have systems and teams that are continuing to monitor and to meet.\""},

Norm Bafunno, who is senior vice president, unit manufacturing and engineering at Toyota Motor North America, said the announcement marked \"another significant milestone\" for the business. The additional investment in the U.S. is part of a wider investment of up to $5.6 billion in battery production, with Toyota noting that demand for battery electric vehicles was growing. To this end, the business said it would aim to ramp up \"combined battery production capacity\" in the U.S. and Japan by as much as 40 gigawatt hours. As well as diesel and gasoline vehicles, Toyota is known for its hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell offerings. It is also attempting to make headway in the increasingly competitive battery-electric market, where firms like Tesla and Volkswagen are jostling for position. This has not been without its challenges. In June 2022, Toyota issued a safety recall for more than 2,000 of its all-electric SUV, the bZ4X. Toyota may be looking to invest billions in EV battery production, but on Wednesday the business stressed it would also \"continue to make every effort to flexibly meet the needs\" of customers \"in all countries and regions by offering multiple powertrains and providing as many options as possible.\" Indeed, the website of Toyota Europe states that the \"internal combustion engine continues to be the most popular means of powering vehicles and it will continue to play a role for the next 20 to 30 years.\" All the above comes at a time when major economies are laying out plans to reduce the environmental footprint of road-based transportation. Just this month, the California Air Resources Board approved a rule that will require all new car sales in the state to be zero emission by the year 2035. Elsewhere, the U.K. wants to stop the sale of new diesel and gasoline cars and vans by 2030. It will require, from 2035, all new cars and vans to have zero-tailpipe emissions. The European Union \u2014 which the U.K. left on Jan. 31, 2020 \u2014 is pursuing similar targets. According to the International Energy Agency, electric vehicle sales hit 6.6 million in 2021. In the first quarter of 2022, EV sales came to 2 million, a 75% increase compared to the first three months of 2021."},

Explaining its decision, the company \u2014 one of several in England and Wales to have announced water usage limits in recent weeks \u2014 said extreme temperatures and this summer's heatwave had resulted in the highest demand for water in more than 25 years. \"The driest July since 1885, the hottest temperatures on record, and the River Thames reaching its lowest level since 2005 have led to a drop in reservoir levels in the Thames Valley and London,\" it said. The TUB does not apply to businesses, although Thames Water said it was asking those within its area \"to be mindful of the drought and to use water wisely.\" This could involve companies switching off water features on their premises and not washing their vehicles, it suggested. \"Implementing a Temporary Use Ban for our customers has been a very difficult decision to make and one which we have not taken lightly,\" Sarah Bentley, the Thames Water CEO, said. \"After months of below average rainfall and the recent extreme temperatures in July and August, water resources in our region are depleted,\" Bentley added. The announcement of the ban comes at a time when many water companies are facing criticism related to leaks from their pipes. For its part, Thames Water said it had teams focused on locating and fixing more than 1,100 leaks per week. When it comes to enforcement of the ban, the firm said it hoped and expected customers to continue using water wisely. \"If we become aware of customers ignoring the restrictions, we'll contact them to make sure they're aware of the rules and how to use water responsibly and wisely,\" it added. \"There are criminal offences for those that repeatedly ignore requests to comply with the ban.\" Last month saw temperatures in the U.K. surge, with highs of over 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) recorded for the first time ever. On Aug. 12, the U.K.'s Environment Agency announced that parts of England had moved into drought status. \"In drought affected areas the public and businesses should be very mindful of the pressures on water resources and should use water wisely,\" authorities said. They added that government expected water firms \"to act to reduce leakage and fix leaking pipes as quickly as possible and take wider action alongside government policy.\" The U.K. is not alone when it comes to drought-related issues. On July 18, the European Commission's Joint Research Centre published a report looking at drought in Europe. \"The severe drought affecting several regions of Europe since the beginning of the year continues expanding and worsening,\" it said. \"Dry conditions are related to a wide and persistent lack of precipitation combined with early heatwaves in May and June.\" In an interview with CNBC earlier this week, Bill Hare, CEO and senior scientist at research non-profit Climate Analytics, explained how the current conditions were having wide-ranging effects. \"On the water supply, it's clear that in the U.K. and other parts of Europe, we're seeing already very significant water stress that's beginning to affect \u2026 ordinary urban residents, not just farmers,\" he said. \"We're seeing the lack of availability for cooling water for thermal, nuclear or coal power stations, which is causing curtailment of power,\" Hare, who was speaking to CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche, said. \"This is a problem we're seeing all over the world,\" he added. \"We're seeing, also, issues for example in Germany, now in the Danube region, with low water flow, meaning you can't carry cargo anymore.\" This was in turn, \"having big implications not just for the transport of energy, but for agriculture, all manner of industrial commodities and so on.\""},
{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/01/cdc-panel-recommends-new-omicron-covid-boosters-with-shots-expected-to-begin-next-week.html", "title": "CDC clears reformulated Covid shots targeting omicron in time for school", "paragraphs": " The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cleared reformulated Covid shots that target the latest omicron subvariants for the fall, making it possible for many people to get an extra booster within days. The agency's independent committee on vaccines voted 13 to 1 earlier Thursday in favor of the shots after reviewing the available safety and effectiveness data over an almost seven-hour-long meeting. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky signed off on the shots a few hours later, clearing the way for pharmacies to soon start administering the shots. Pfizer 's omicron boosters were OKed for people ages 12 and older, while Moderna 's updated shots were authorized for people ages 18 and older. The eligible age groups can receive the boosters at least two months after completing their primary series or their most recent booster with the old shots. Walensky said her decision followed \"a comprehensive scientific evaluation and robust scientific discussion.\" \"If you are eligible, there is no bad time to get your Covid-19 booster and I strongly encourage you to receive it,\" she said in a statement. Pfizer plans to ask the Food and Drug Administration to also authorize the new boosters for children ages 5 to 11 years old in early October, company executives told the committee Thursday. The original vaccines will no longer be used as a booster in people ages 12 and older now that the reformulated shots are coming online. Public health officials are expecting another wave of Covd infection this fall as immunity from the old vaccines wanes off, more contagious omicron subvariants spread, and people spend more time indoors as the weather turns colder and families gather for the holidays. The CDC and the FDA hope the new boosters will provide more durable protection against infection, mild illness and severe disease. The reformulated shots target omicron BA.5, the dominant variant of Covid as well as the strain that emerged in China more than two years ago. The U.S so far has secured 171 million doses of Pfizer's and Moderna's new boosters. More than 200 million people are eligible for the shots, according to the CDC. Dr. Sara Oliver, a CDC official, told the committee Thursday that there should be enough supply of the vaccine to meet demand this fall. There is no data from human trials on the new BA.5 boosters, so it's unclear how they will perform in the real world. The CDC and FDA used human data from clinical trials for shots targeting the original version of omicron, BA.1, which triggered a stronger immune response than the old vaccines. Pfizer and Moderna were originally developing omicron boosters to target BA.1, but the FDA asked the companies to switch gears in June and develop BA.5 shots instead after the subvariant became dominant. The decision to focus on BA.5 did not leave enough time to wait for data from human trials ahead of a fall vaccine rollout. The lack of human data for the BA.5 shots has caused some controversy, but Dr. Peter Marks, a senior FDA official, said the agency followed the same process used for years with strain changes for flu vaccines. Marks said on Wednesday that flu vaccine strains are also changed without human clinical data. Dr. Pablo Sanchez, the only committee member who voted against the shots, called the recommendation premature and said the U.S. should have waited for human data before proceeding with the boosters. \"There's a lot of vaccine hesitancy already \u2014 we need the human data,\" said Sanchez, a professor of pediatrics at Ohio State University. But Sanchez said he believes the new boosters are safe and he will likely receive one himself. Panel member Dr. Oliver Brooks, chief medical officer at Watts HealthCare Corporation in Los Angeles, questioned why the FDA decided to go with a BA.5 vaccine when clinical data is available for the BA.1 shots that the vaccine makers were originally developing. Brooks ended up voting in favor the shots. But Dr. Sarah Long, also a committee member, said there's no reason to expect the BA.5 boosters will be inferior to the old shots since they also include the original Covid strain, and they have potential to reduce hospitalizations and deaths heading into the fall and winter. Long also voted in favor. Officials at the FDA and CDC have said the omicron BA.1 and omicron BA.5 boosters are similar enough that the immune response data from the BA.1 shot should give a good indication of how the BA.5 shots will perform. Omicron BA.1 and BA.5 are closely related with a four-mutation difference, according to Dr. Jacqueline Miller, who works on vaccine development at Moderna. Moderna completed enrollment in clinical trials on the BA.5 shots last week and should have results by the end of the year, Miller told the CDC committee on Thursday. Pfizer's clinical trial is also ongoing, though company hasn't said when it expects results. The health agencies also reviewed data on the BA.5 shots from mouse studies. Moderna presented data showing that the BA.5 shots increased antibodies in mice more than fourfold compared with the old shots. The mice express the same cell protein as humans that the virus latches onto. Pfizer's BA.5 booster increased antibodies 2.6 fold in mice compared with the original vaccine. The most common side effects from the human trials of the BA.1 shots was pain, redness, swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headaches, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea, vomiting and fever, according to the FDA. Oliver, the CDC official, told the committee that health officials do not expect any difference in the safety profile of the BA.1 and BA.5 shots given that subvariants differ only by a few mutations. But Oliver noted that the risk of myocarditis following a BA.5 booster shot is unknown. There is an elevated risk of myocarditis among young men and adolescent boys following the second dose of Pfizer's and Moderna's shots but the risk of myocarditis from Covid infection is higher, according to the CDC. \"We know that the myocarditis risk is unknown but anticipate a similar risk to that seen after the monovalent vaccines,\" Oliver said. The monovalent vaccines are the old shots that have been administered to millions of people in the U.S. over the past two years. The original vaccines, which were first authorized in December 2020, are no longer providing meaningful protection against infection because the virus has mutated so much over the past two years. The shots were developed against the first strain that emerged in China, so they are no longer matched to target the omicron subvariants that are spreading. Infections, hospitalizations and deaths have declined dramatically since the massive wave of omicron infection last winter, but have plateaued this summer at a stubbornly high level. Omicron BA.5 is the most contagious and immune evasive variant yet, and breakthrough infections have become increasingly common as a consequence. The old vaccines effectiveness against hospitalization also declined after omicron BA.5 became dominant. A third dose was 77% effective at prevention hospitalization four months after receiving the shot, but protection declined after 120 day to as low as 34%, according to CDC data. A fourth dose in people ages 50 and older was 56% effective at preventing hospitalization after four months. Deaths and hospitalizations from Covid among people ages 65 and older have increased since April, according to Heather Scobie, a CDC epidemiologist who presented data during Thursday's meeting. Deaths have risen in particular among people ages 75 and older, Scobie said. The CDC has shifted to a more targeted public health response with an emphasis on protecting the most vulnerable \u2014 the elderly, people with serious medical conditions and those who have weak immune systems. Although there's no data on the real-world effectiveness of the new boosters, the U.S. is moving rapidly to roll them out in the hope that they will protect people this fall."}
