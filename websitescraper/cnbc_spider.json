As economies reopened after the pandemic, companies in the hospitality, retail and entertainment sectors ramped up hiring, said Feon Ang, Asia-Pacific managing director at the professional networking platform. All three countries saw an increase in job postings on LinkedIn for jobs in the accommodation sector, such as hotels, motels, casino hotels and bed-and-breakfast inns. According to data collected by LinkedIn, paid job postings for careers in Australia, India and Singapore increased in June compared to a year ago, with the following sectors seeing the most growth: 1. Accommodation, up 62%\n2. Retail jobs, up 46%\n3. Financial services, up 25% 1. Accommodation, up 65%\n2. Construction, up 40%\n3. Real estate and equipment rental services, up 25% 1. Accommodation, up 15%\n2. Transport and logistics, up 31%\n3. Entertainment providers (businesses involved in performances, events, and exhibitions), up 100% However, jobs in Singapore's health care, education and construction industries were all down by more than 30%, according to LinkedIn. Ang noted that the cutback of job postings for Singapore's construction sector was likely due to measures introduced by the government to cool the private and residential property market. Although there's an increase in hiring rates across the three countries, there was less competition among job seekers in June compared to one year ago, LinkedIn data showed. On average, there was a more than a 50% drop in applications for paid job postings on LinkedIn in Australia, India and Singapore \"Even as job postings rise, workers are being more selective in picking their next role, and so competition for jobs on average is down,\" said Ang. \"This means that workers are in a position to demand more out of work, and have higher expectations of what they want in a job \u2013 and that's a healthy sign,\" she added. In both Australia and Singapore, paid job postings that offered remote work options fell. Paid listings in Australia fell by 8% in June compared to a year ago, although sentiment for flexible working arrangements was still strong. Opportunities that offered remote working options received two times more applications on average, according to LinkedIn. In Singapore, paid job postings that allowed employees to work from home fell from 8% in the first quarter to 6.7% in the second quarter. But unlike employees in Australia, LinkedIn observed that interest in flexible working arrangements seemed to be waning in Singapore. Employers in India felt differently, according to the data. Paid job postings in the South Asian country which offered remote work options remained relatively constant throughout the year and there wasn't particularly more interest in jobs with remote options. \"Postings with remote options received only 1.1x more applications on average relative to their absolute share of all job postings in both quarters,\" said LinkedIn."},

The local government approvals allow Baidu's Apollo Go robotaxi business to eliminate the cost of human personnel in some instances. The initial scale of the permits is small: 10 robotaxis divided between two suburban areas of Wuhan and Chongqing, two major Chinese cities. In April, Baidu and rival robotaxi operator Pony.ai received approval from a Beijing suburban district to operate robotaxis without a human driver. But the Chinese capital still requires human staff to sit in the robotaxi with passengers. Municipal authorities across China have issued an increasing number of permits in the last year that allow robotaxi companies to operate and charge fares in selected areas. In the U.S., Alphabet's Waymo and General Motors ' subsidiary Cruise can already run public robotaxis with no human staff in the vehicles. Laws for testing robotaxis and charging riders vary by city and state. Baidu claimed it has received more than one million orders for robotaxi rides. In the first three months of the year, the company said it operated 196,000 rides. Baidu is set to release second quarter results on Aug. 30."},

In a recent note, Charles Dumas, chief economist at U.K.-based investment research firm TS Lombard, said that action on climate change is often criticized as moving too slowly. However, with governments increasing spending to aid their post-Covid economies, they may start catching up. A key tenet of this is the ever-decreasing cost of electricity per megawatt hour, according to figures from TS Lombard, with costs of solar, offshore and onshore wind dropping over the last 10 years, while gas and coal have remained largely the same. \"Effectively by 2030 the cost of renewable electricity is going to be half that of coal and gas sourced electricity,\" Dumas told CNBC. These trends will bring many of the various pledges to reach net zero more closely in sight. The fatal floods in Germany in recent weeks have put the impacts of climate change firmly in the spotlight again but they are only the latest in a series of devastating extreme weather events of late, including the sprawling wildfires in Oregon. Amid this backdrop, the United Nations Climate Change Conference, better known as COP26, will meet in Glasgow in November. It will mark one of the most significant multilateral meetings on climate since the Paris agreement. Dumas said that as COP26 approaches, governments need to understand their key priorities, and among them should be infrastructure investments as numerous technological and engineering challenges continue to obstruct renewable energy. \"I think the intermittency problem is pretty serious and it's not just that the sun goes down at night,\" Dumas said. In the case of solar power, output can be mixed depending on the location of infrastructure like solar farms. \"There's huge variation with sunny days in winter and sunny days in the middle of summer so the intermittency takes on a very big seasonal aspect,\" Dumas said. \"You can have vicious weather for a long time in the middle of December or January and lo and behold you wouldn't want to be depending on solar power.\" Energy transmission could be another bottleneck, he said. While the developing world, including several African nations, has great potential in developing sites for generating solar power, that power needs to move easily. \"The issue of transmission technology is really major. If you want Chad to be the new Saudi Arabia, because of the Sahara Desert there's a lot of sun there, but you want the electricity to be used in Europe then you're talking about some expensive processes and processes needing a lot of research and a lot of further investment.\" Storage and carbon capture are all areas that require hefty investment, Dumas added, if governments are to reach their net-zero targets. \"What we need is a very clear public policy lead in order to get anywhere near these net zero promises and I suspect that actually what it's going to be about is a carbon tax, which the Americans may resist but will be necessary,\" he said. Paul Steele, chief economist at an independent policy research institute called the International Institute for Environment and Development, said that climate action and renewable energy investments will serve the dual purpose of tackling the climate crisis while creating jobs for the post-Covid economy. \"One of the priorities coming out of Covid is to create labor intensive employment. Both in developed and developing countries, you can provide labor intensive employment through renewable energy,\" Steele said. One example, he said, was the retrofitting of boilers in homes in the U.K., which would help push the country toward its climate targets and create new jobs while being relatively inexpensive in the grand scheme of things. Steele said that investments to drive a climate-friendly economy cannot be short term or have quick goals. He pointed to the various government support schemes for the airline industry, which has been battered by the pandemic. Just this week, the European courts gave the nod to a $2.9 billion bailout for Air France-KLM's Dutch business. Bailout funds like these should be tied to sustainability commitments by the airline industry, he said, but that can be a dicey proposition to get over the line. \"Governments aren't making the connections enough and traditionally treasuries and particularly the ministries of transport are still dominated by road building lobbies and people who like to build highways and increase transport rather than people who want to invest in sustainable alternatives.\"  "},

Thursday's announcement follows the largest climate funding package in U.S. history, which President Joe Biden signed into law in August. The package includes incentives to jump-start domestic supply chains for electric vehicle batteries, although Piedmont said plans for the plant were in development prior to the Inflation Reduction Act. Now that the company has selected the site in McMinn County, it will begin the process of securing the necessary permits, which can be lengthy. Still, the company is targeting construction beginning in 2023, with production starting in 2025. When fully operational, the plant will produce 30,000 metric tons of lithium per year, making it the largest lithium refining facility in the U.S, according to the company. Piedmont said it will churn out enough material to supply roughly 500,000 electric vehicles annually. Piedmont currently has no active mines in the U.S., so once the facility is up and running it will process spodumene concentrate from Piedmont's international operations in Quebec and Ghana. Eventually, the company hopes to use lithium that's mined domestically. The company has plans for a mine as well as another plant in North Carolina, although CEO Keith Phillips said it's challenging from a permitting perspective, since both the mine and the plant are on the same site. Albemarle runs the only meaningful lithium mine in the U.S., which is in Silver Peak, Nevada. Additionally, only 2.1% of lithium is refined in the U.S., according to data from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. China dominates the industry, refining more than half of global lithium supply. Should Piedmont's North Carolina mine and plant secure the required permits, however, the company forecasts its lithium output doubling, with the company supplying 1 million electric vehicles per year. Piedmont Lithium's announcement also comes as automakers are rushing toward vast electric vehicle fleets. By some forecasts, there simply won't be enough lithium to meet demand in the foreseeable future. The International Energy Agency estimates that in order to meet the goals set forth in the Paris Agreement, lithium demand will grow by over 40 times by 2040. Building new mines takes years. They're capital intensive and can face permitting challenges. There are also those opposed to new mines, who argue that the world should instead focus on existing production. Piedmont's Phillips noted that in just the last year $33 billion has been announced for electric vehicle battery manufacturing plants in the U.S., which would require 500,000 metric tons of lithium annually. \"That is more than all the lithium hydroxide produced in the world currently, so clearly the industry is facing a critical resource shortage,\" he told CNBC. \"Anyone who can produce material to supply this market \u2014 especially domestically in the United States \u2014 will be in a favored position.\" Piedmont plans to invest around $600 million developing the Tennessee facility."},

Here\u2019s what it costs \u2014 and how they pay for it", "tag": "CNBC Travel", "author": "Monica Buchanan Pitrelli", "datetime": "2022-08-22 05:22:04", "paragraphs": " Ernestas Tyminas felt \"stuck\" in his role as a marketing manager at a newspaper in Colorado Springs, Colorado. So he requested two months off to backpack through Asia, he said, landing in Beijing in January 2019. \"On the first day \u2026 I meet this one,\" he said, gesturing to Darina Karpitskaya, sitting by his side. The couple, speaking to CNBC via video from Dubai, said they met via the travel app Couchsurfing, which links solo travelers together. Karpitskaya, 31, and a flight attendant at the time, had been grounded in Beijing for two days because of mechanical problems with her return flight. Though more solo travelers agreed to meet that day, Tyminas and Karpitskaya were the only two who showed up. After one day together, they planned to meet again in Asia one month later. Karpitskaya returned to Asia, and the couple's second date was a \"crazy one-month adventure\" to Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines, said Tyminas, 29. It was in the Philippines, he said, that he decided he wasn't going back to his old life. \"We were \u2026 laying on the beach under the stars,\" he said. \"We were kind of starting to dream about this lifestyle.\" After returning to Colorado, Tyminas quit his job, sold his belongings and moved to Europe, he said. Karpitskaya wasn't quite there yet, saying, \"At first it sounded like: Oh my God, you're quitting your job. You're moving from America. Maybe it's too soon. But at the same time, when I came back from that trip I felt like I'm living a life that I'm not enjoying.\" Tyminas flew from Denver to Paris with his dog \u2014 an 82-pound Borzoi, once known as the \"Russian Wolfhound,\" named Cosmo, who is over 6 feet tall on his hind legs. \"They gave me three rows of seats, and the dog was just laying on the floor,\" he said. From there, the couple traveled often \u2014 to places like Italy and Iceland \u2014 but not yet full time, they said. Then Karpitskaya got what she called her \"dream job\" \u2014 a position with Emirates airline. She moved to Dubai, but the couple continued to meet and travel together. Then Covid hit, and Karpitskaya accepted four months of unpaid leave from her job. \"We said: We have four months \u2014 we can go explore whatever is open,\" said Tyminas. The trio \u2014 including Cosmo, who traveled in a huge bed in the back of their SUV \u2014 traveled first to Croatia, then slowly across much of Europe, including many former Soviet states, said Karpitskaya. She never returned to her job, and couple have been traveling ever since, she said. In the beginning, they spent between $1,000 and $2,000 a month \u2014 all from savings \u2014 by staying in cheap accommodations, cooking at home and seeking out free activities, said Tyminas. As money started to dry up, Tyminas took several online jobs, which netted between $2,000 and $3,000 a month, which wasn't far from his salary of $3,300 in Colorado, he said. But the work was cumbersome, and it \"felt like I still had a job,\" he said. So the couple decided to open a marketing and graphic design company, despite the fact that \"we didn't know a lot,\" said Tyminas. They reached out to thousands of people, they said, often working late into the night. Potential customers would ask, \"Can you design book covers?\" \"Can you promote music?\" Tyminas said his response was always the same, \"Of course I can.\" In reality, he was learning on the job, he said, relying on YouTube, Google and online research. But clients were very happy, he said. \"They paid me half of what they would pay other marketing agencies and the results, they said, were better than they had before,\" said Tyminas. In the first month, the couple made $6,000, he said. Now, sometimes they earn several thousand dollars in a day working with real estate companies and music labels, he added. \"We write blogs for people \u2014 we do everything,\" said Tyminas. Plus \"we don't have to report to anybody. We're our own bosses.\" In the past six months, the couple said they spent an average of $4,000 a month. More than half goes to accommodations, which vary by location \u2014 from $3,100 per month in Dubai to $1,500 in Lisbon, Portugal, they said. They limit stays in expensive locations, like Switzerland, to no more than a week, they said. One way to save money is booking monthlong stays on Airbnb, which cuts down average nightly rates and reduces service and cleaning fees, said Tyminas. But even when they bounced from place to place to visit Europe's Christmas markets last year, they still ended up paying about $2,500 that month, he said. Karpitskaya said she doesn't want these costs to scare people because they spent far less in the beginning. At the time, they spent about 80-100% of their income, but now Tyminas said \"we spend about 30% and \u2026 save the rest.\" The couple told CNBC they still travel modestly \u2014 no five-star hotels \u2014 and they still cook most meals at home. But they spend more on activities that they film for their YouTube channel Dream Team Travels \u2014 another \"completely self-taught\" venture, they said. A life of constant travel isn't all fun and games, they said. They encounter dirty Airbnbs and hosts who cancel reservations at the last minute. They've also had their camera equipment and clothing stolen twice \u2014 once in Mexico, and more recently in France \u2014 plus an attempted theft of their belongings from their car in Barcelona, while they were sitting in it. They have also thought about settling down when they find a place they really love, such as the beaches of Portugal or the French Riviera, said Tyminas. \"But then \u2026 we drive somewhere else and we're like this place is also just as good,\" he said. When Russia invaded Ukraine, quickly occupying the Kherson region where Karpitskaya's parents live, Tyminas emailed CNBC to say that they'd stopped traveling for the time being. \"The first few weeks we didn't even leave our apartment,\" he said. \"We spent a lot of time arranging transportation for civilians as well as many dogs from shelters to be taken out of dangerous regions for adoption in Europe.\" By the summer, they had resumed traveling, but were still helping to evacuate Karpitskaya's family. \"Just a week ago we were able to finally get Darina's parents out of Ukraine,\" said Tyminas, adding that they are currently in his family's home in Lithuania. \"We also did a trip to Romania to pick up Darina's sister and her five-month-old baby from the border and took her to live in Germany.\" The couple are now in Malaysia, they said, and plan to explore Southeast Asia for the next two months."},

The world's biggest long-haul carrier will be retrofitting over 120 aircraft with new interiors, as well as dishing up menus with new vegan options and cinema snacks like popcorn, Emirates said in a statement.\nOther new perks for the carrier's first-class travelers include unlimited portions of Persian caviar, paired with Dom Perignon vintage champagne. Those investments come just as Emirates posted a $1.1 billion loss for the year ended March 31. \"While others respond to industry pressures with cost cuts, Emirates is flying against the grain and investing to deliver ever better experiences to our customers,\" said the president of Emirates airline, Tim Clark. Emirates is not the only airline pulling out all the stops to ride the tailwinds of \"revenge travel\" \u2014 the idea that people are making up for time \"lost\" during the pandemic to travel again. Earlier this year, Finnair launched a new line of premium economy cabins, featuring seats that provide around 50% more space than their economy seats. Air France, likewise, announced new long-haul business seats in May, complete with sliding dividers for passengers who want their own private space.\nEmirates told CNBC that it has seen \"a lot of interest\" in these luxury upgrades, though it said it does not have the full numbers yet. The upgrades come on the heels of an industry report predicting that business travel spending will return to pre-pandemic levels in 2026 rather than 2024, as previously forecast. Though spending by business travelers has been on the upswing, the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) annual report stated that the 2021 figure was still less than half of the over $1.4 trillion that was generated by in business travel in 2019. One travel analytics company, however, noted a shift in demand toward premium seats. \"During the pandemic, we saw that the numbers of people travelling by air collapsed. However, the proportion of travelers flying in premium cabins increased significantly,\" Olivier Ponti of ForwardKeys told CNBC in an email.\nPonti said that before the pandemic, the split between premium and economy seats was a ratio of 13:87, compared with 17:83 in 2022.\n\"While there's no guarantee that the shift towards premium seats will be maintained as air travel recovers, one can understand why the airlines would want to invest in keeping hold of premium passengers, who, this year have typically spent 575% more on a seat than those flying economy.\" Others are skeptical, however. Edward Russell, an editor at Skift, a travel industry news site, told CNBC it's unclear how much of an effect \"small\" product changes will have on sales. \"Most travelers either fly the airline, or alliance, where they have loyalty, or opt for the cheapest fare. It is only a small subset of travelers who will actually book a flight based on the addition of a sliding door or unlimited caviar.\""},

But a new study suggests it may not be worth the time \u2014 at least in some places. The travel insurance comparison site InsureMyTrip compared rates for 950 hotels in 19 global cities on three popular booking websites as well as each hotel's site. According to the results published last week, Hotels.com had the best overall rates \u2014 but just barely. Hotels.com had the best rates in 620 instances, which was slightly higher than Expedia, which had the cheapest rates in 579 instances. Booking directly with a hotel was more expensive, but by only about $6 more on average, according to the study. \"There have been conflicting views on hotel rates, and people ... believe that booking through online travel platforms ensured a better rate than the hotel website,\" said Shalabh Arora, director of marketing at India's Four Seasons Hotel Bengaluru. \"However, it's not so at Four Seasons where rate parity is taken very seriously.\" He said the hotels' website has a pop-up function which compares rates offered by the hotel with those on other booking platforms. Finally, the website Booking.com had the cheapest rates in 72 instances \u2014 or about 7% of the time \u2014 according to the study. \"Not only was [Booking.com] rarely the most affordable, but it was also the most expensive option the majority of the time,\" according to the published results. The company's Managing Director for Asia Pacific Laura Houldsworth responded to the study by email, stating that the company aims \"to always be transparent with our customers\" and that \"our property partners are free to set their own prices on Booking.com.\" She added that \"our promise to price match also means that if a customer should ever find a lower price on another website, Booking.com will refund the difference.\" The report found average hotel rates on Hotels.com and Expedia were the same in seven of 19 cities, with overall averages varying by just 27 cents. \"Expedia and Hotels.com often had the same price, especially with the international hotels,\" said Sarah Webber, director of marketing for InsureMyTrip. Both brands are owned by Expedia Group, which also operates other travel booking websites, including Travelocity, Hotwire, Orbitz and CheapTickets. \"Hotels working with Expedia Group distribute their rates across all of our brands,\" said Anna Brown, a company public relations manager. \"The rate is similar across brands, however various offers ... approved by our hotel partners, sometimes create rate differences.\" Brown said rates can also vary through brands' app-only pricing, while Hotwire's \"Hot Rates\" mask hotels' names prior to purchase in exchange for deep discounts on last-minute bookings. Booking.com is part of Booking Holdings, which operates Priceline, Agoda and Kayak. Booking Holdings had the highest revenue among all online travel agencies from 2019 to 2021, according to the research company Statista. The InsureMyTrip report showed significant rate differences in certain cities. For instance, travelers could save as much as $88 per night in Honolulu, if they found the lowest price. In New York, the report found average hotel rates varied from $293 on Hotels.com to $367 on Booking.com. The study also found: But rate fluctuations were less pronounced outside of the United States. Posted rates varied less than $10 per night on average in Hong Kong, Bangkok, Macau, Kuala Lumpur and Istanbul, according to the research. InsureMyTrip's study represents a snapshot in time, with the research analyzing rates for a double room for two people booked for the night of Aug. 27, 2022, the firm said. All searches were conducted on the same day to avoid price fluctuations, since \"prices can change quickly and without warning,\" said Webber. However, the study did not consider whether rates were refundable or included taxes, said Webber. \"To keep the study as simple as possible, we took the price seen on the sites as the final cost,\" she said. \"So, it's definitely something to consider as not all hotels or booking sites include the same extras in the final price.\" Other factors, such as prepayment requirements and breakfast inclusions, can affect rates too, which further complicates the hotel price comparison process \u2014 for researchers and travelers alike."},

He was speaking at the 2022 Global Supertrends Conference. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced in May that the country will take firm steps to restart idled nuclear power plants to stabilize energy supply and prices. In 2011, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami, which killed nearly 16,000 people and caused the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986. Though there have been reservations among the Japanese public over the use of nuclear energy, particularly when it comes to the issue of safety, Tanaka said the future of nuclear power is now safer, and stressed the importance of minimizing risk and maintaining \"peaceful use.\" Tanaka attributed the increase in public support to the possibility of \"serious problems by the end of this year\" if Japan does not have nuclear power. He added that Russia supplies 9% of Japan's natural gas, and losing that supply could spell trouble for the country as it would have to turn to alternative sources, which would lead to a spike in energy prices. Japan has repeatedly criticized Russian aggression in Ukraine and has slapped Moscow with economic sanctions. In response, Russia sanctioned over 300 Japanese lawmakers in July. Russia recently cut gas supplies to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to just a fifth of its capacity. Moscow has repeatedly denied it is weaponizing fossil fuel supplies over the Russia-Ukraine war. Tanaka said that Japan wants to secure energy supplies but also work toward reaching carbon neutrality by 2050, and striking that balance could prove increasingly challenging. Nuclear power has been touted as an important option for decarbonization.\n\"Japan is trying to secure the supply of energy, especially electricity, while trying to maintain the targets of carbon neutral by 2050 intact. So this is really (a) challenge for Japan to do many things,\" he said."},

Pitney Bowes, which provides logistic services for retailers including eBay and American Eagle, will integrate Gatik's self-driving box trucks starting in 2023. The trucks will supplement five existing routes in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and will run packages between distribution centers, so-called \"middle-mile\" delivery. The partnership gives the global logistics company access to some of the first commercial autonomous delivery trucks on the market and adds to Gatik's growing footprint in the U.S. short-haul delivery market. Gatik, which was founded in Silicon Valley in 2017, aims to automate shorter, business-to-business hauls with fixed, repeatable routes. It launched a partnership with Walmart in 2021, becoming the first commercial delivery company to go completely driverless. While some autonomous driving systems, such as Tesla's, have faced heightened scrutiny, Gatik says it's navigated the difficult environment by limiting its focus on middle-mile routes. \"By constraining the autonomy problem, we can get to the point where the driver comes out [of the safety driver role] faster than anyone else in the industry,\" Gatik's CEO, Gautam Narang, told CNBC in an interview. \"We chose the safest possible routes and the easiest possible routes.\" Gatik's routes do not cross state lines, and they are optimized with the help of regulators to avoid schools, hospitals and unprotected left turns. The trucks used are also smaller than many the trucks of its competitors. The Pitney Bowes routes will have a safety driver to start, but the company expects to have the trucks completely driverless within a few months. At scale, Gatik estimates it could provide up to 30% cost savings for Pitney Bowes. Pitney Bowes has begun a national rollout of automation technology in its warehouses, and pending the pilot program's success, a broader rollout of Gatik's automated delivery routes could follow. The startup raised $85 billion in its Series B funding last year and says it can achieve profitability at a site-specific level, as long as two fully driverless trucks are operating each route."},

Bosch plans to expand an existing factory in Anderson, South Carolina, to build the fuel cell \"stacks\" starting in 2026. The investment is expected to create at least 350 new jobs at the factory, the company said. Bosch's North America president, Mike Mansuetti, said the company decided to invest in U.S. production to support \"growing demand\" from its automotive customers in North America. \"As our success in acquiring e-mobility business here in the region continues, it's critical that we have local production capabilities to support our local customers,\" Mansuetti said in a statement. Fuel cells chemically convert the energy in hydrogen gas to electricity, emitting only water. While expensive to build, the devices are finding applications in large electric vehicles that would otherwise require excessively large and heavy battery packs, such as semitrucks, construction equipment and military vehicles. The fuel cells built by Bosch in South Carolina will be used to power electric heavy trucks, including forthcoming models from Arizona-based EV truck startup Nikola, the company said. Nikola has begun pilot testing of a fuel cell-powered version of its Tre electric semitruck, with about 500 miles of range. The company expects to begin production of the fuel cell-powered Tre by the end of next year, and to launch a second fuel cell truck with 900 miles of range in 2024."},

The sister of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was speaking at the Global Supertrends Conference 2022 on Wednesday. The Web3 is a hypothetical, future version of the internet based on blockchain technology \u2014 an \"ideal utopia,\" said Zuckerberg. \"But \u2026 that's not what's happening. What's happening in reality, is chaos.\" The founder and CEO of Zuckerberg Media, a production company and marketing consultancy, added, \"You're the only one watching your own back and your own assets, people are spending time protecting themselves by setting up so many different wallets and protecting their identity and that's not contributing to development in the area.\" Zuckerberg, who was an early employee at Meta \u2014 formerly known as Facebook \u2014 explained that various metaverses are now acting as \"their own walled garden,\" in which users are unable to use their assets across platforms. The metaverse can be loosely defined as a virtual world where people live, work and play. With cryptocurrency, users can buy and develop virtual land or dress their own avatars. \"Right now, I'm on Decentraland, my son is on Roblox, my other son is on Fortnite. That's great \u2014 we're all in the metaverse. [But] we have no interaction with one another,\" she said. \"In order to really unlock the potential [of Web3], we're going to need to figure out a system where there's interoperability. What you have goes with you wherever you are, [and] we're not there yet,\" Zuckerberg added. However, according to Zuckerberg, that's easier said than done because no company running a metaverse right now wants to give up control or \"share that ownership.\" \"That's why it's not we're not seeing that kind of consumer mainstream adoption yet because there needs to be a world where you leave the house with one wallet. And you need to see that same behavior online also.\" She added that Web3 needs experts who have been involved in the global banking system and Web2 \u2014 the internet that we know today \u2014 to lend a \"protective layer.\" The need for such experts is all the more important because it has been \"too easy\" for users to be scammed or lose all their assets in Web3, said Zuckerberg. \"There needs to be more protections for consumers \u2026 I think we will wind up [with] web 2.7, where there is some centralization, keeping people safe, but the ability to port your assets with you to any site.\" Another thing that needs to be improved in Web3 is user-friendliness, she added. \"It should not take 45 steps to set up a cryptocurrency wallet, buy a currency and enter the metaverse. It needs to [be] one-stop, beginner-friendly.\" The metaverse may still be in its infancy, but Zuckerberg pointed out that sectors like real estate will be \"extremely valuable.\" \"Wherever there's scarcity \u2026 there's value. I think the big question will just be, is there scarcity in the metaverse and if there is, there will be value in real estate there,\" she added. According to data from MetaMetrics Solutions, real estate sales in the metaverse surpassed $500 million in 2021 and could double in 2022. Zuckerberg said that education and training will be another \"huge area\" for opportunities and revenue. \"Especially in this new age where workers are remote, it is very difficult to upskill remote workers \u2026 I think training in the metaverse, education in an interactive way, is going to become crucial for every business that has a remote work,\" she added. \"We're really just scratching the surface of what we're going to see.\""},

Here\u2019s how to use them", "tag": "Tech", "author": "Sofia Pitt", "datetime": "2022-08-26 17:05:38", "paragraphs": " You use your iPhone every day, but you might only be scratching the surface of what you can do with it. For instance, the iPhone has a bunch of \"hidden\" menus that help you do things like search across apps, go back to the last screen, find widgets that show snapshots of certain information, or quickly turn your Wi-Fi off and on. They're hidden because they require you to make specific gestures that aren't necessarily easy to guess. But once you know where they are, they're quite useful. Apple adds more functions to the iPhone every year. The company announced Wednesday that it's hosting a fall event on Sept. 7 that's almost certainly for the iPhone 14. We'll also probably hear when its next update, iOS 16, will be released to everyone. And that'll bring even more features. Here's a quick overview to get you going. Many apps on the iPhone have hidden menus called Quick Actions. All you have to do is hold down the icon for the app you want to see the Quick Action menu for. Apps that come pre-installed on your iPhone, like the Camera, Mail, Notes, Settings, Messages and Phone apps have these menus. Accessing them can help you perform actions on apps quickly. Each Quick Actions menu has functions that make sense for that app. All you do is just press and hold down on the icon on your home screen. For example if you hold down the Notes icon, a Quick Actions menu will pop up that gives you shortcuts to draft a new note, create a new checklist, insert a new photo, or scan a document. Here's what it looks like: If you hold down the Phone app icon, a Quick Actions menu will pop up that gives you the option to view your most recent voicemail, create a new contact, search for a contact, or view your most recent call. Here's what the Phone Quick Actions menu looks like: If you have small hands like me, you may have noticed it's hard to access all of your iPhones functions one-handed. You can quickly access the icons at the top of the phone without stretching your fingers with an option called \"Reachability.\" This lowers the screen down so you don't have to fumble with two hands. Reachability is off by default, so do this to turn it on: Now that it's on, use it by quickly swiping down at the bottom edge of the screen. The key word here is quickly. Here's what the screen looks like once you've enabled Reachability. I find myself using Reachability when I'm cooking with one hand and trying to use my iPhone with the other and can't stretch my thumb all the way to the top of my screen. You probably already know how to swipe down from the top middle of your home screen. That's what brings up your recent notifications. But, if you're coming from an iPhone with a home button, you might not know that you can also swipe down from the top right corner of your screen (or up from the bottom if your iPhone has a home button.) This opens Control Center, which gives you quick access controls to common functions. You can use it to turn on your flashlight, to recognize a song with Shazam, control your smart lights, toggle Wi-Fi or Bluetooth on/off, launch the calculator and more. But you have to set it up so it has the right items in it. To manage what appears in Control Center, do this: You can place little mini apps, called widgets, on your home screen. But there's also a whole hidden section dedicated to widgets. This is to the left of your home screen, so you access it by swiping right across your screen. You can customize it with any app that has widgets. I have a photo gallery in mine and an icon that shows the battery life left on my iPhone and Apple Watch. I also use it for a quick glance at my Apple Fitness rings, CNBC Trending news stories, and stock quotes. There are two ways to get widgets on this screen. For the built-in Apple widgets, and a handful of others that have been custom-built, do this: If you don't see the widget you want to add, you might need to take an extra step. In this case: You can search through apps, the web, maps, dictionary, files and more all by using the iPhone's universal search menu. You can bring this up by swiping down from the middle of your home screen. You'll also see Siri suggestions for your most common actions. (Reminder: swiping from the middle-top will bring down notifications and swiping from the top-right will bring down Control Center.) You can quickly change apps or close them by swiping up from the bottom of the screen and then holding until you feel a gentle vibration. Swipe right to move through apps. Tap an app to switch to it, or swipe up to close it. Here's a little bonus trick: did you know you can switch between apps by also just swiping right or left across the bottom of the screen? Try it! Open an app and then swipe right across the bottom. It'll go to the last app you had open. Swipe left to go back or keep swiping right to move between apps Here's a second bonus: You can go back to the last screen in an app, like the previous webpage, by swiping right from the edge of the screen. The best way to try this is to open a website, go to another site, and then swipe right across the screen. You'll be back where you started. If you swipe left from the right side of your phone, you'll move forward again."},

Founded in 2009, Rivian is focusing on upscale electric trucks and SUVs with an emphasis on outdoor adventure. CNBC's John Rosevear calls them the \"Patagonia of electric vehicles.\" Rivian launched its first vehicle, the R1T electric truck, at the end of last year. It's been working to scale up production and is planning to ship its SUV \u2014 the R1S \u2014 built off of the same platform, later this year. It's been a long and arduous road to get to this point. But Rivian has received some major assistance, including $700 million from Amazon in 2019 and $500 million from Ford a few months later. Initially, Rivian and Ford sought to develop a joint vehicle together, but the companies ended up canceling those plans. However, the partnership with Amazon is still on track. Following its investment, Amazon said it would purchase 100,000 custom-built electric delivery vans, part of its move to electrify its last-mile fleet by 2040. When Rivian went public in November 2021, it had one of the largest IPOs in U.S. history. But the turbulent economy has cast a shadow over its rocketing success. As the market responded to inflation and fears of a recession, the stock took a big hit. But with the Amazon deal secured, some are confident the EV maker can weather the storm. \"When Amazon invested in them\u2026but more importantly, put a commitment to buy all of those vehicles from them, they changed the market dynamic around that company,\" said Mike Ramsey, an auto and smart mobility analyst at Gartner. Last month, Rivian and Amazon rolled out the first of the electric vans. They are starting to deliver packages in a handful of cities, including Seattle, Baltimore, Chicago and Phoenix.

The phone was locked when I handed it to him. Then, suddenly, he was staring at my home screen. He had placed his finger on the part of the display where the phone scans for fingerprints, and the phone unlocked. I gasped. My heartbeat accelerated. \"Pavlo!\" I said. \"That's not what's supposed to happen.\" He pushed the power button to lock the phone and tried unlocking it a second time. It worked. My eyes bulged. He did it again and again, surprising our friends nearby. Thankfully, no one else there could unlock my phone. I searched online and found that other people have experienced similar issues since the phone became available last month. Some people were able to unlock the Pixel 6a using fingers they hadn't registered in the device's settings. And two YouTube channels have demonstrated that people could unlock a Pixel 6a even when their fingerprints hadn't been saved in the phone. As a rule, both consumers and corporate workers want to keep what's on their devices private. People will expect that their devices will not inadvertently allow access to strangers or even friends or family members. That means this issue isn't the best thing to happen for Google's fast-growing Pixel line of smartphones that take on Apple's iPhones and myriad Android phones. Google shipped 800,000 smartphones in the U.S. in the second quarter, up some 230% year over, according to estimates published on Monday by technology industry research group Canalys. Apple, Samsung, Motorola and TCL all shipped more phones in North America than Google, Canalys said. The $449 Pixel 6a contains the same Google Tensor chip as the Pixel 6 from 2021, which Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet, told analysts in April is \"the fastest-selling Pixel ever.\" The A line of Pixel phones such as the Pixel 6a is meant to deliver similar technology as Google's flagship models at a lower price. People can set up the Pixel 6a without enabling the fingerprint unlock feature, but it's still a popular alternative to a passcode. \"The under-display fingerprint sensor in Pixel 6a was tested to meet the industry standard for security where the probability of an unverified fingerprint match is 1 in 50,000 attempts,\" a Google spokesperson told CNBC in an email. \"We continually make improvements to our fingerprint performance, stability, and reliability, and users should ensure they are running the latest version of Android 13.\" Apple says on its website that the probability of two separate fingerprints matching a single finger enrolled in its Touch ID technology is one in 50,000. The odds of correctly guessing a person's four-digit passcode to unlock a device, for the sake of comparison, is one in 10,000. Authentication issues have cropped up on phones from other manufacturers that have relied on face recognition. Family members who weren't exactly alike managed to unlock Apple's iPhone X in 2017, and in 2019 people discovered that it was possible to unlock Samsung's Galaxy S10 with a photo of the phone's owner. While it's rare, I still found it frightening that someone else's fingerprint unlocked my phone. If you're also worried about it, you might want to just rely on another authentication method instead.

First, its much-hyped effort with JPMorgan and Berkshire Hathaway to reform health care, Haven, ended its short life. Now, Amazon Care, its effort to tackle telemedicine and primary care for the employer market on a national basis \u2013 which Amazon itself trumpeted as gaining more and more clients \u2013 is being shut down.\nIs that all the proof we needed of what many people have said over the years: health care is just harder to disrupt than most industries? Maybe not, though maybe it is a signal of a change in the approach to how Amazon will attempt to gobble up more health industry market share. The shutdown of Amazon Care may come back to a simple choice that companies, especially those with a lot of cash, have to make when it comes to breaking into new markets: build or buy? For some health-care industry watchers, it's no surprise that Amazon Care is going away as a stand-alone entity. When Amazon made the decision in July to acquire primary care company One Medical, which does what Amazon Care was hoping to ultimately do on a national basis, it was the writing on the wall that something was going to change. And for a cash-rich company looking for opportunities to buy into a stock market that had pushed down the value of recently public health companies \u2013 One Medical had traded as high as $58 in 2021 and Amazon announced plans to buy it for $18 a share \u2013 Amazon may have been more opportunistic than anything else in plotting the next stage of its future in health. Buying into a market where it wants more share and where it requires a physical presence isn't new to Amazon, nor is being opportunistic in the timing. As Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods reaches the five-year mark, it's worth remembering that Amazon's shares went up in value as much on the day it announced the acquisition of Whole Foods as the purchase price for the then-troubled high-end grocer. \"It's not surprising they're shutting it down,\" said Sari Kaganoff, general manager of consulting at Rock Health, which invests as a VC in health start-ups and has a health advisory and research arm. \"Their vision always was to have a primary care integrated solution and now it will have a better solution than what they could build,\" Kaganoff said. It was a little surprising, maybe, that Amazon announced the shutdown before the One Medical deal even closed, but One Medical has many more markets, many more offices and many more companies that are clients than Amazon ever did (it had to boast about signing up Whole Foods, which it owns, as a client for Amazon Care). Maybe also surprising: it didn't wait to rebrand One Medical as part of Amazon Care. PillPack, its acquisition in the pharmacy space, still has a brand but is now folded within Amazon Pharmacy. By Amazon's own account, Amazon Care was a failure, at least in the terms conveyed in the internal memo provided to the press about the shuttering. There's no doubt it struggled with the problem of building up an in-person care component nationwide, staffing up in a sector where it has limited history, and getting corporate customers to sign on. While telemedicine is a nice have, it's not a full health-care solution, and Amazon would have had to ramp up investment considerably to build a true national hybrid health-care practice with sites and physicians and clinics. In the end, let's say Amazon Care was a test run for a business, and once Amazon learned enough to know what it wanted in the long-term, it bought the better company at a time when its value was depressed. \"I don't think they failed, because One Medical is great,\" Kaganoff said. Amazon learned a lesson that has influenced the fortunes of many health disruptors in recent years: it's hard to make a stand-alone startup work in the sector \u2014 even if you're one of the richest companies in the world \u2014 consolidation is increasingly the way to go. \"Amazon Care was no different than any other stand-alone health startup in terms of needing to be consolidated,\" Kaganoff said. \"They played around with it a bit,\" she added, enough to know their ambitions remain validated on the market, but just not the way there. \"One of the ways we've worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we've gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we've determined that Amazon Care isn't the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers,\" the internal memo said. While Amazon's health-care efforts in recent years have been associated with direct battles to unseat recent health disruptors (e.g., Amazon Care vs. Teladoc), Wall Street analysts have said the market should worry more about Amazon making a string of acquisitions that speak to broader aims. That's what seems to be happening. Amazon isn't done yet pushing its cash around in buying more in health-care, with recent headlines reporting it is among bidders for Signify Health, which has an overlap with the Iora Health business of One Medical, focused on a more complicated, Medicare-centric market than standard national care practices. It's clear Amazon still plans to be a formidable player in the health-care space. It can leverage its ability to personalize its offerings, connect to its pharmacy, and ultimately pose a threat to many other retail giants aiming to upend healthcare. Walmart acquired telehealth company MeMD in 2021; CVS, which already offers telemedicine through a deal with American Well, is another rumored bidder for Signify; and Walgreens has VillageMD and is opening up hundreds of offices in markets around the country. That retail disruption is only going to grow, for a bottom-line reason. When you look at the share of wallet, from consumers to employers, the health-care market is a big part of spending. Amazon is already in almost every chunk of the wallet, maybe not banking (though it does have credit cards). What's the biggest chunk of the market they are not in? \"It's healthcare, and they already have so many things consumer-health oriented, it just makes sense to go big in health care,\" Kaganoff said. When Haven \u2014 which disbanded after three years \u2014 debuted to much fanfare, people thought the combined might of Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan and Amazon could result in a significant driving down of costs throughout the health-care system that Warren Buffett has called a tapeworm on the national economy. And that's still part of the story. Anything Amazon does is partially about driving down cost and driving up efficiency. \"Better care at a lower cost,\" is what Cano Health CEO Marlow Hernandez told CNBC last week is the paradigm shift for all players in the space. Amazon's consumer internet business may be the ultimate in transactional disruptors, but the transactional system of health care is under threat and people don't want to treat it like just another form of retail. \"What patients have been demanding is that integrated platform where they can build relationships and no longer be a number,\" Hernandez said. That's referred to as value-based care \u2014 and maybe it is a sign of just how messed up the U.S. health-care system is that \"value\" for patient is a novel idea \u2014 and it is leading to a lot of consolidation. Hernandez projects the primary care market will grow from $1.8 trillion to $3.7 trillion by 2030. And that speaks to the underlying aim for any big company like Amazon and its rivals. \"I think it's just market share,\" Kaganoff said. The end of Amazon Care did seem abrupt. But as Amazon moves from primary care, into more complicated care, and potentially even chronic care \u2013 and combines pharmacy and over-the-counter medication with all its offerings \u2013 everyone from private health start-ups to Teladoc to retail competitors and health-care incumbents should continue to worry. Amazon Care's failure may have come at a cost and may have come as a surprise, even to some within Amazon, but what the company ultimately is buying and building off may still make it the stronger disruptor."},

In the second quarter of the year, e-commerce firm Alibaba posted its first ever flat year-on-year quarterly revenue growth and social media and gaming company Tencent reported its first sales decline on record. JD.com, China's second-largest e-commerce player, posted its slowest revenue growth in history, while electric vehicle maker Xpeng posted a wider-than-expected loss as well as weak guidance. Combined, these companies have a market capitalization of more than $770 billion. In the June quarter, China saw a resurgence of Covid cases. China has stuck to its so-called \"zero-Covid\" policy, a strict set of measures including lockdowns and mass testing to contain the virus. Major cities, including Shanghai, were locked down for several weeks. China's economy grew just 0.4% in the second quarter, and that impacted the strength of the consumer as well as spending from companies in areas like advertising and cloud computing. Those headwinds fed through to China's technology giants. \"Retail sales decreased year-over year in April and May due to the resurgence of Covid-19 in Shanghai and other major cities, and has slowly recovered in June,\" Daniel Zhang, CEO of Alibaba, said on the company's earnings call this month. Alibaba's logistics networks in China were also affected, and it said some of its cloud computing projects were delayed. Tencent, the owner of the WeChat messaging app and one of the world's biggest gaming firms, also felt the impact of the zero-Covid policy. Its fintech services revenue grew more slowly than in previous quarters as fewer people were going out and using its WeChat Pay mobile payments service. The company's online advertising revenue also fell sharply as companies tightened their budgets. JD.com fared well in the second quarter because it controls a lot of its logistics supply chain and inventory. However, it did see costs rise for fulfilment and logistics in the face of lockdowns. Electric carmaker XPeng said it expects to deliver between 29,000 and 31,000 vehicles in the third quarter. But that was weaker guidance than the market expected. As well as seasonal weakness, XPeng president Brian Gu said that \"traffic in the stores are less than what we've seen before because (of the) post-COVID situation.\" China's internet giants enjoyed a boom during the pandemic as people turned to online services such as shopping and gaming amid lockdowns. That has made year-on-year comparisons harder. Now, the Chinese economy is facing a number of headwinds this year that has made the macroeconomic environment even tougher. China's technology sector continues to contend with a much stricter regulatory environment. Over the past two years, China has introduced tougher policy in areas from gaming to data protection. With growth rates falling more sharply than in previous years, investors are cautious on their outlook. \"What I find interesting is how the narrative on the big tech companies ... has changed: early on in the pandemic, COVID was expected to benefit the big online platforms at the expense of 'offline' businesses, as much of the economy would be stuck at home with little other choice than to shop online and entertain themselves online,\" Tariq Dennison, wealth manager at GFM Asset Management, told CNBC via email. \"The recent revenue and earnings dip hitting these big tech names reflects zero COVID concerns short-term, but also has many long-term investors, including myself, revising our estimates of the long-term growth prospects of these names.\" Dennison said that Tencent, Alibaba and JD.com previously sustained more than 25% annual revenue growth and a long-term slowdown would be a concern. \"If this quarter is a sign of a permanent slowdown to single digit growth rates, rather than just a temporary dip, that of course would have a significant impact on long-term valuations of these shares,\" Dennison said."},

The three major U.S. indices were set for a slightly higher open Wednesday after three straight days of losses that stretch back to Friday, when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank would continue its aggressive fight against inflation. Still, some observers think we've seen the worst for stocks this year, given how they bounced back. The S&P 500 surged 17% from its June low to the peak in August, Charles Schwab's Randy Frederick pointed out. \"That's a pretty impressive rally,\" he said. \"It would be very rare to give all of that back because it just doesn't happen very often.\" Bed Bath & Beyond unveiled its new business plan Wednesday. It includes $500 million in new financing, as well as plans for layoffs and store closures. The announcement was heavily telegraphed. Multiple reports had already said that the troubled home-goods retailer was close to securing a loan to help pay suppliers and keep the lights on. The company also announced a share offering Wednesday morning, which sent shares falling. Bed Bath's disarray has stretched from its unpopular new merchandising strategy in stores to its executive offices (several top executives, including CEO Mark Tritton, left earlier this year) to markets, where activist investor and meme stock maven Ryan Cohen cashed out his stake this month. Price increases in the euro zone hit a new record this month, according to Europe's statistics authority. Inflation rose at a rate of 9.1%, slightly beating economists' projections of 9%. It marks the ninth straight month of record consumer price increases. The main culprit is energy prices, a consequence of Russia's war on Ukraine. Adding to that anxiety is a scheduled maintenance period, from Wednesday through Sunday, for the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, which runs from Russia to Germany. Russia has gradually choked off gas supply in recent weeks, which Germany considers a political move as European nations support Ukraine in the war and prepare for the coming winter. We're going to have to wait a little longer for NASA to launch its highly anticipated Artemis 1 mission to the moon. Originally set for Monday, the launch was bumped by officials Wednesday night to Saturday. But even that attempt might not happen if weather is bad, or if the engine issue is such a hangup that the rocket would need to be moved off the launchpad for more significant repairs. That could mean weeks or months more of waiting for the already much-delayed mission to take off, according to CNBC's space business reporter, Michael Sheetz. The Justice Department late Tuesday released its latest filing in its national security probe of former President Donald Trump's handling of sensitive government documents at his private Mar-a-Lago residence in South Florida. The filing said records were likely moved and hidden, and \"that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation.\" It added: \"That the FBI, in a matter of hours, recovered twice as many documents with classification markings as the 'diligent search' that the former President's counsel and other representatives had weeks to perform calls into serious question the representations made in the June 3 certification and casts doubt on the extent of cooperation in this matter.\" Trump has accused the FBI of being corrupt and has dismissed the investigation, one of several he's facing, as a witch hunt. \u2014 CNBC's Samantha Subin, Melissa Repko, Hannah Ward-Glenton, Sam Meredith, Michael Sheetz, Dan Mangan and Kevin Breuninger contributed to this report. \u2014 Sign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every stock move.

But as the world's two largest economies pour resources into the race for dominance in the field, there's also collaboration afoot. Indeed, some AI experts even say that cross-border cooperation is key to getting the most out of advancements in computing. Engineers from Microsoft and China's ByteDance, the parent of TikTok, are doing their part to advance that notion. Through a project called KubeRay, they're working together on software intended to help companies more efficiently run AI apps. At the Ray Summit this week in San Francisco, ByteDance software engineer Jiaxin Shan and Microsoft principal software engineer Ali Kanso discussed their progress with data scientists, machine learning experts and other developers interested in building large applications using open source software called Ray. Shan and Kanso explained the technical details behind KubeRay and pitched the software as helpful in powering AI apps that run on multiple computers, or distributed computing. \"Jiaxin and I have been working for like a year on an open source project and this is the beauty of a community gathering like this,\" said Kanso, who has a Ph.D. in computer science. \"We're not in the same company, but we meet every week, we collaborate every week.\" Shan, who previously worked as a software engineer at Amazon Web Services, is based in the Seattle area, near Microsoft's headquarters, according to his LinkedIn profile. Companies often partner and share engineering resources to contribute to open source projects, which have gained popularity in recent years and have seeded numerous startups. The Microsoft-ByteDance collaboration is notable because of the brewing rivalry between the U.S. and China with respect to AI and intellectual property, and concerns over how technological advancements could be used for surveillance and privacy intrusion. Microsoft has been investing heavily in AI along with competitors like Amazon, Google parent Alphabet, Facebook parent Meta and Apple. Like Google once did, Microsoft maintains an AI research lab in China, helping it tap into the country's academic talent. Meanwhile, as TikTok's usage has exploded in recent years, ByteDance has been diving into various AI open source projects. In 2020, for instance, ByteDance debuted its NeurST software tool kit for AI-powered speech translation. And last year the company debuted its CloudWeGo open source enterprise software. The Ray Summit was organized by software startup Anyscale, whose technology is built on Ray. Anyscale, which also contributed to KubeRay, was co-founded in 2019 by a group of engineers that included Ion Stoica, a computer science professor at the University of California at Berkeley. Stoica has a long history in open source software and co-founded Databricks, a data analytics company that was valued at $38 billion in a financing round last year. Databricks was built on top of Apache Spark, which was developed at Berkeley under Stoica's direction. Anyscale is trying to follow a similar path, and said this week that it's just raised a fresh $99 million. Tech giants like Microsoft and Meta often use open source projects as a way to propagate their own internal technological ideas to the wider community. Doing so helps lure potential recruits and serves as way to market the companies as technology leaders to developers. The Microsoft-ByteDance relationship has some history to it. In 2020, Microsoft sought to acquire TikTok from ByteDance at a time when then-President Donald Trump threatened to ban the social media app over unspecified security reasons. A year later, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella called the botched deal \"the strangest thing\" he's ever worked on. WATCH: Former TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer on ByteDance decision to scrap IPO plans"},

A few states quickly followed through. Idaho sold $300,000 of bonds in a Russian oil company in early March. A day before the invasion, the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System sold its shares in the Russian bank Sberbank. But those examples are outliers. Six months into a war that has killed thousands of Ukrainians and displaced over 12 million more, most of the pledges to drop Russian investments \u2014 some made with great fanfare during news conferences \u2014 have gone unfulfilled, according to an Associated Press review, state retirement administrators and firms that invest state funds. Swift global reaction has cut off much of Russia's economy from the rest of the world. That has made it nearly impossible for divestment by state pension funds, university endowments and other public-sector holdings \u2014 as well as private investments such as those in 401(k) accounts. \"These pension funds want to get out, but it's just not realistic to sell everything in the current environment,\" said Keith Brainard, research director at the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. Benjamin Smith, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island treasury, said the factors that make it hard to divest also show that a worldwide effort to isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin is working. \"This is good news because it means that pressure from investors across the world, including Rhode Island, is succeeding in exacting a toll on the Russian economy, making it more difficult for Putin to fund his military operation, state-owned companies, and corrupt network of oligarchs,\" he said in an email, noting that Rhode Island's pension plan exposure in Russia never exceeded 0.3% of its assets. Any pre-war investments in Russia are now worthless, or nearly so. That's raising questions from some officials and fund managers about whether divesting is even necessary. In Hawaii, one of a handful of states where top administration officials did not pledge to divest, Gov. David Ige said at a May 5 news conference that the state's employee pension system had \"very little to almost nothing\" invested in Russia. \"The few remaining investments are quite small, and so I didn't feel compelled to just make a statement for political reasons that we would be divesting,\" he said. Before Russia's invasion in late February, many government-controlled investments had only small holdings \u2014 a fraction of 1% in every reported case \u2014 in Russian investments. But even that could amount to millions of dollars. The largest U.S. public-sector retirement fund, California's CalPERS, said just 17 cents of every $100 of its portfolio was in Russian investments as the war broke out. Even so, that translated into $765 million worth of stocks, real estate and private equity. By the end of June, the value had shrunk to $194 million. The entire loss was because the holdings dropped in value; none had been sold. There is no way to know how much state government entities in the U.S. have invested in Russia or companies based there, but collectively they were worth billions of dollars before the war. Much of the money was invested in Russian government bonds, oil and coal companies as part of emerging-markets index funds. Quick to condemn the invasion, state officials said they could put pressure on Putin by dumping their Russian investments. \"Our moral imperative before these atrocities demand that you act to address Russia's aggressions and immediately restrict Russian access to California's capital and investments,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote in a letter on Feb. 28 to the boards overseeing the massive pension funds that serve teachers, state and local government workers and university employees. Across the country, governors and other top officials made similar statements. Just after the invasion began, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed an executive order calling for divestment \"to the extent possible,\" while Arizona's Board of Regents voted to exit any Russian investments. The treasurers for 36 states plus the District of Columbia and U.S. Virgin Islands signed a joint letter in March advocating divestment of publicly controlled funds from Russia. They noted a financial reason for doing so: \"The current crisis also constitutes a substantial risk for states' investments and our economic security.\" A major chunk of the government holdings in Russia is in the form of index funds that investors use to mimic overall stock market performance. Russian stocks were commonly part of funds specializing in emerging markets. MCSI and other firms that decide which stocks should be in the funds quickly dropped Russian securities. But the companies that sell investment products based on those indexes were left in the lurch, still leaving pieces of Russian stocks in their investors' portfolios. As part of the sanctions, stock markets in the U.S. and elsewhere stopped the trading of Russian stocks. And the Moscow Stock Exchange was closed for nearly a month, reopening with tight controls that keep U.S. investors from selling. The assets sank in value amid the invasion, though the precise value isn't always clear. Maryland said that as of the beginning of February, $197 million of its state retirement and pension system funds were invested in Russian assets. A month later, the state estimated the value had plunged and amounted to just $32 million. The state has been unable to unload its investments. For the handful of states in which top officials have not endorsed divestment, eroding values like that are the main reason. Shortly after the invasion, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said the number of state investments in Russia was \"minuscule\" and noted that the value was about to \"shrink to almost nothing as the Russian economy is being virtually shut off from the world.\" In Florida, Lamar Taylor, the interim executive director of the agency that oversees investments of pension funds, said during a cabinet meeting that some investment managers might seek to unload Russian assets as soon as they're able, while others could hold on in case they're worth more later. At the meeting, Gov. Ron DeSantis said the State Board of Administration has a legal responsibility to try to make money for the retirement system. \"That would violate your fiduciary duty, if you liquidated at massive losses for political reasons rather than for the best interests of the beneficiaries,\" he said. But DeSantis said there was a way to make it easier: Lawmakers passing a bill banning investment in Russia. \"If the Legislature could speak clearly, that would be something we'd welcome here, just to make sure we're not furthering investments in parts of the world that are not reflective of our interests or values,\" he said. Hank Kim, executive director of the National Conference on Public Employee Retirement Systems, said he has told member pension funds that taking steps to divest is important even if it can't be completed right away. \"The public has a right to know that it was debated in a serious manner,\" he said."},

Ron DeSantis learned who his Democratic challenger will be this fall. The impact of redistricting was on full display. Democrats sorted through rivalries amongst themselves. And abortion may give Democrats a lifeline in an otherwise rough November. The most intense stretch of the midterm primary season ended Tuesday with results that will set up fierce general election contests across the United States. Takeaways from Tuesday's contests in Florida and New York: Midterm elections are usually miserable for the party in power. But Democrats hope one of their biggest losses in memory may ultimately salvage 2022 for them. Ever since the conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court revoked the constitutional right for a woman to obtain an abortion, Democrats have seen a boost in donations, polling and performance in special elections for open congressional seats. The latest came Tuesday in a Hudson Valley swing district that, in a Republican wave year, should have been an easy GOP win. Instead, Democratic Ulster County executive Pat Ryan defeated his Republican counterpart from Duchess County, Marc Molinaro. The stakes, governing-wise, were small \u2014 the seat will disappear in the fall as a new congressional map goes into effect. But because the race became a referendum on abortion after the high court's ruling, the political implications are huge. It comes after a ballot measure to ban the procedure was crushed in solidly conservative Kansas. Republicans were anticipating a typical midterm landslide, with inflation high and President Joe Biden's approval rating low. It may still end up a solid GOP year, but Ryan's win is the latest indication that Democrats don't have to abandon hope. One Florida politician wasn't facing a primary challenge on Tuesday but made sure to dominate the news anyway \u2014 DeSantis. DeSantis is considered former President Donald Trump's top rival for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, partly due to the way he's leaned into political and cultural divides in the Sunshine State. On Tuesday he demonstrated why. The governor began the day with a Cabinet meeting, which included the only Democrat elected statewide in Florida, Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried. She was competing for her party's nomination to face DeSantis that evening. DeSantis shook Fried's hand as the meeting concluded and told her \"good luck\" before criticizing her campaign and predicting \u2014 accurately, it turned out \u2014 her loss in brief remarks to reporters. \"I think that you know she had an opportunity as being the only Democrat elected statewide to exercise some leadership and maybe get some things done and instead she's used her time to try and smear me on a daily basis, that's all she does,\" DeSantis said of Fried. After polls closed in the evening, DeSantis grabbed the spotlight again, speaking to a crowd in Miami. \"We're not going to let this state be overrun by woke ideology, we will fight the woke in the business, we will fight the woke in government agencies, we will fight the woke in our schools,\" DeSantis said. \"We will never, ever surrender to the woke agenda. Florida is the state where woke goes to die.\" Expect to hear a lot more like that from DeSantis in the months \u2014 and possibly years \u2014 ahead. Florida and New York, which held primary elections Tuesday, were two of the states whose legislative maps were most radically redrawn this year to favor one political party. It was part of a centuries-old political gambit known as gerrymandering. But Tuesday night showed two different sides of gerrymandering. The New York map that Democrats redrew to ruthlessly target vulnerable Republicans got tossed out by the state's highest court as an illegal partisan act. The map was redrawn to be more balanced, disregarding the political fortunes of some of New York's most prominent members of Congress and lumping several high-profile lawmakers in the same district in a push for equity. Ignoring scattered protests that its April ruling came too late in the process to change the map, the high court moved the state's congressional primary to Tuesday, two months after its June primary for state offices. That's why New York's Democratic primaries Tuesday were so fractious and chaotic. In contrast, Florida's Republican-appointed State Supreme Court declined to change the partisan map that DeSantis pushed the Republican-controlled Florida legislature to approve. Unlike the New York court, the Florida court declined to mess with the map close to the election. As a result, Florida's incumbent House members generally stayed put Tuesday night, not forced into any career-ending primary battles because of districts being moved. The great exception was Rep. Charlie Crist, who ran for \u2014 and won \u2014 the Democratic nomination for governor partly because DeSantis' map transformed his district into a solidly Republican one. The new map also effectively eliminated two seats, currently represented in Washington by Black Democrats, where African Americans comprise the largest share of voters. Nationally, both parties tried to gerrymander during the past redistricting cycle, but Democrats were reined in slightly more than Republicans \u2014 largely due to Florida and New York. Florida's top court may change that in the coming years when it rules on challenges to DeSantis' maps. Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court is considering multiple cases that could change the ability of courts to redistrict gerrymanders. That may help determine whether we see more congressional primaries like New York's, or more like Florida's. It's been muted by the spectacle of Trump's makeover of the GOP, but Democrats also spent the primary season torn over the direction of their party. Left-wing contenders continued to mount primary challenges to centrist Democrats. The left lost its most prominent bids to dislodge incumbent House members in south Texas and Cleveland. Two new losses came Tuesday, when a liberal state senator was crushed by Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney in a congressional primary north of New York City. And attorney Dan Goldman, who worked on Trump's first impeachment, narrowly beat a bevy of more progressive rivals in a primary for a congressional seat centered in Brooklyn. But the left has won some victories this primary season, nabbing a nomination for a House seat in Pennsylvania and seeing one of its favorite politicians, that state's Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman, win the party's nomination for Senate. Neither side has been crushed, so expect more left-on-center primaries next election cycle. Trump set out to demonstrate his dominance of the GOP this primary season, and he succeeded \u2014 to a point. His approval helped set the party's Senate field and was pivotal in a number of hotly contested primaries. He claimed his biggest prize last week, when his chosen candidate beat Rep. Liz Cheney in Wyoming's Republican primary. On Tuesday, Trump's chosen candidate, Air Force veteran and conservative activist Anna Luna, won her primary in an open GOP-leaning seat on Florida's Gulf Coast. But Trump had some huge humiliations \u2014 especially when he tried to intervene in governor's races in Idaho, Nebraska and especially Georgia, where Trump failed to oust Gov. Brian Kemp for refusing to overturn the 2020 election in his state and award it to Trump. Even more significantly, Trump elevated candidates who may not be able to win competitive races \u2014 or may even pose a threat to democracy itself. Last week, the GOP's Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, warned that his party may not win a Senate majority due to \"candidate quality\" among its nominees. They include Trump-backed candidates struggling in swing states, like Herschel Walker in Georgia, JD Vance in Ohio and Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania. Others, like the GOP's nominees for Pennsylvania governor, Doug Mastriano, and Arizona governor, Kari Lake, have denied that Trump lost the 2020 election, raising questions about whether they'd certify the actual winners of future elections if they take over their statehouses. Trump does not always have to intercede for extreme candidates who have mimicked his style to rise in Republican primaries. On Tuesday, Laura Loomer, a conservative provocateur who's been banned from several social media websites for posting anti-Muslim remarks, surprised many with a strong \u2014 albeit unsuccessful \u2014 showing in a primary challenge to 73-year-old Florida Rep. Daniel Webster. Still, Trump's effect on the GOP became immeasurable this primary season. ___ This story has been corrected to show Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney defeated a liberal state senator, not an assemblywoman; and deletes reference to a Democratic-appointed court as having redrawn the map; others were involved as well."},

The agency was slated to launch its Artemis I mission from the Kennedy Space Center during a two-hour launch window that opened at 8:33 a.m. ET, sending the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule on a more than monthlong journey around the moon. But NASA was unable to resolve a temperature problem identified with one of the four liquid-fueled engines, discovered with under two hours to go in the countdown. The uncrewed launch marks the debut of the most powerful rocket ever assembled and kicks off NASA's long-awaited return to the moon's surface. It's the first mission in NASA's Artemis lunar program, which is expected to land the agency's astronauts on the moon by its third mission in 2025. While Artemis I will not carry astronauts, nor land on the moon, the mission is critical to demonstrating that NASA's monster rocket and deep space capsule can deliver on their promised abilities. Artemis I has been delayed for years, with the program running billions over budget. NASA has backup launch dates scheduled for Sept. 2 and Sept. 5, but officials during a press conference on Monday afternoon couldn't say whether the engine issue will be fixed before either of those dates. \"There's a non-zero chance we'll have a launch on Friday,\" NASA's Artemis mission manager Mike Sarafin told reporters, before adding \"we really need time to look at all the information, all the data.\" NASA's team is expected to meet on Tuesday afternoon to identify the next steps for Artemis I. If a launch attempt in the next week isn't possible, the SLS rocket may need to be rolled off the launchpad for what would likely be a lengthy delay. The possibility of moving the rocket off the launchpad \"is getting ahead of our data reviews,\" Sarafin said. \"If we can resolve this operationally at the pad then there won't be any need for that.\" Sarafin also noted the engine temperature problem was a known risk, as the agency had not fully completed a fueling test known as a \"wet dress rehearsal\" after four attempts this year. The agency also found a hydrogen leak in the engines and a crack in the thermal protection system material that safeguards the core of the rocket during the countdown Monday \u2014 though those issues were resolved before the launch was called off for the day."},

The \"swatting\" call falsely claimed that a man had been shot multiple times in a bathtub at a residence in Rome, Georgia, the city's police department said in a report shared with CNBC. The Rome Police Department at 1:04 a.m. ET dispatched five officers, who learned en route that they were headed to Greene's house, the report said. They rang the doorbell and were met by the Republican congresswoman, who \"assured us there was no issue,\" the report said. A spokeswoman for the department told CNBC that the officers checked Greene's home. Afterward, the department received a second call from a suspect using a computer-generated voice who claimed responsibility for the incident. The suspect \"explained that they were upset about Ms. Greene's stance on 'trans-gender youth's rights', and stated that they were trying to 'SWAT' her,\" the police report said. The department said it is working with the U.S. Capitol Police on the investigation, which remains active. The Capitol Police declined CNBC's request for comment. Greene, a far-right lawmaker backed by former President Donald Trump, had introduced a bill in Congress last week that would make it a felony to provide gender-affirming care to transgender minors. The legislation came amid a growing right-wing movement against those treatments that recently targeted Boston Children's Hospital, which said last week that it is dealing with an influx of hostile calls and emails, including threats of violence. \"Right now, Congresswoman Greene's safety is our number one concern,\" Greene's spokesman, Nick Dyer, said in a statement to CNBC. Dyer called Greene the \"victim of a political attack on her family and home\" and also described it as a \"violent crime,\" though no violence is alleged to have occurred. Greene first revealed being swatted in a tweet. In an interview later Wednesday, Greene said she was startled by the police presence at her home, but decided not to carry a gun as she answered the door, \"which was very out of norm for me.\" The swatter endangered both her and the officers, Greene said in the interview with \"Real America's Voice,\" a conservative outlet. \"Whoever this person is, they deserve to be locked up,\" she said."},

She had been prescribed the antiviral drug Paxlovid, which has proven to be highly effective at preventing serious disease and death among those at highest risk from Covid-19, but a minority of those prescribed the drug have experienced a rebound case of the virus a few days after their initial recovery. The White House said the president was considered a close contact, and would wear a mask \"for 10 days when indoors and in close proximity to others\" in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance. The White House will also increase the frequency of his Covid-19 testing."},

Zinke and his chief of staff \"made statements to [Interior's Office of the Inspector General] with the overall intent to mislead them,\" the OIG's report said. \"We found that both Secretary Zinke and the [chief of staff] made statements that presented an inaccurate version of the circumstances in which the [Interior Department] made key decisions,\" the watchdog's report added. \"As a result, we concluded that Secretary Zinke and the [chief of staff] did not comply with their duty of candor when questioned.\" Zinke's alleged lies came in response to questions about his interactions with department lawyers and employees, a U.S. senator and lobbyists for MGM Resorts International. MGM, a casino operator, sought to block an application by two Native American tribes, the Mashantucket Pequots and the Mohegans, to jointly build and run a casino in northern Connecticut. Zinke disputed the report's findings. He unsuccessfully asked the Inspector General's office to delay publicly releasing the report until after the November midterms, when he will be seeking to represent the western area of Montana in its new second House seat. In a statement Wednesday, Zinke's lawyer called the report and the timing of the release a \"political smear.\" The watchdog's findings come six months after another Inspector General's office report found the House hopeful misused his position as secretary to promote a development project in his Whitefish, Montana, hometown. Wednesday's report said the Inspector General referred the casino issue to the Justice Department in 2018, when Trump and his attorney general were still in office. The Justice Department declined to prosecute in the casino lobbying episode last year. It also chose not to prosecute in 2021 after it received the report about the Montana development. The newly released report details how MGM Resorts International actively opposed the Connecticut tribes' application in a lobbying effort targeting Zinke. MGM operates a casino just over the border in Springfield, Massachusetts. MGM's lobbyists specifically pushed Zinke not to approve amendments to the tribes' existing gaming agreements with the state of Connecticut, the report said. Connecticut required those amendments in exchange for the state approving the casino, which would operate on nontribal lands. Zinke ultimately sent the amendments back to the tribes without taking action, effectively stalling their plan. He later told Inspector General investigators \"more than 10 times that he relied on the Associate Deputy Secretary [of Interior] and the [department's Office of the Solicitor's attorneys] in making his decision to return the Tribes' amendments without action,\" the report said. But those other people did not corroborate Zinke's claims, according to the report. An unidentified U.S. senator told investigators that he asked Zinke not to approve the tribes' amendments in a September 2017 phone call. Zinke told investigators he did not recall the senator asking him to \"take a particular stance,\" according to the report. \"Based on our analysis of Secretary Zinke's statements, we concluded that he provided a misleading portrayal of the basis for his decision to return the Tribes' amendments,\" the report said. Zinke \"repeatedly stated that he had not had conversations with anyone outside the agency \u2014including the U.S. Senator or industry lobbyists \u2014 who advised him to take a different course of action,\" the report said. \"Given the number and extent of communications with these outside personnel, combined with the absence of information that anyone \u2014 counsel or otherwise \u2014 within the agency advised this course of action, we find that Secretary Zinke's description of events was not accurate,\" it added. In a statement emailed to CNBC on Wednesday, Zinke's lawyer Danny Onorato said, \"More than four years ago, Secretary Zinke cooperated fully in a politically motivated investigation conducted by the Interior Department's Inspector General.\" \"Secretary Zinke repeatedly told the Inspector General that he was not subject to any influence in that matter because he lacked jurisdiction to act on the application,\" Onorato said. \"That should have ended the inquiry. Instead, on the eve of an election, the IG has released a misleading and inaccurate report that suggested Secretary Zinke lacked candor in his interview with IG agents.\" \"That is wrong,\" the lawyer said. \"The record here shows that it was the IG's draft report that initially concealed dispositive evidence and that a Federal Judge in Washington D.C. agreed that Secretary Zinke's position was legally sound. After Secretary Zinke objected to a draft report, the IG now acknowledges this critical fact in watered down fashion.\" \"Put simply, Secretary Zinke was completely candid in his interview and was legally vindicated by the Court's decision. The content of the IG report and the timing of its release will be seen for what it is, another political smear,\" Onorato said."},

The announcement of the upcoming military aid package, the 19th such installment, comes as Ukraine celebrates 31 years of its independence from the Soviet Union. \"The United States of America is committed to supporting the people of Ukraine as they continue the fight to defend their sovereignty,\" Biden said in a statement, acknowledging Ukraine's Independence Day. He added that that approximately $2.98 billion \"will allow Ukraine to acquire air defense systems, artillery systems and munitions, counter-unmanned aerial systems and radars to ensure it can continue to defend itself.\" The latest security assistance package is unlike presidential drawdown authorities which authorize the delivery of weapons directly from U.S. arsenals. Wednesday's package of nearly $3 billion is authorized through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, or USAI, which uses funds appropriated by Congress. The USAI finances America's defense industry to scale up arms production. \"This announcement represents the beginning of a contracting process to provide additional priority capabilities to Ukraine in the mid-and long-term to ensure Ukraine can continue to defend itself as an independent, sovereign and prosperous state,\" wrote Pentagon press secretary Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder in a statement. The package consists of six additional National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, or NASAMS, as well as munitions for those systems, 24 counter-artillery radars, 245,000 rounds of 155 mm artillery ammunition, 65,000 rounds of 120 mm mortar ammunition, laser-guided rocket systems, support equipment for the Scan Eagle drone as well as Puma drones. New to this security package is the counter-drone capability dubbed Vampire. It was not immediately clear how many the Pentagon would provide. Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl told reporters at the Pentagon that USAI packages can typically take months or years to deliver depending on the defense contracting process. \"This package of capabilities is really aimed at getting Ukraine what they're going to need in the medium to long term so it's not relevant to the fight today, tomorrow or next week,\" explained Kahl. \"It is relevant to the ability of Ukraine to defend itself and deter further aggression a year from now or two years from now,\" he added. Earlier this month, Biden announced a presidential drawdown authority of $9.8 billion for Ukraine, the biggest weapons installment to come directly from U.S. stockpiles. So far, the U.S. has committed more than $13.5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since January 2021. Kahl said that the U.S. is far from ceasing its financial support for Ukraine. \"This package will certainly not be our last,\" Kahl added."},

Nadler and Maloney were both first elected in 1992 and have since risen to prominence in the House: Nadler chairs the Judiciary Committee, and Maloney chairs the Oversight Committee. After he cast his ballot Tuesday morning on the Upper West Side, Nadler, 75, told NBC News he intends to keep his top spot on the Judiciary panel if he is reelected. \"Absolutely, I'll seek to remain the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, and I don't think there's much question that that'll happen,\" Nadler said. \"What I want to achieve is, I believe this country is really a democratic system \u2014 with a small d \u2014 is threatened.

A third candidate in the race was Suraj Patel, 38, a former staffer for President Barack Obama who ran on a platform of generational change against the two septuagenarians. Nadler's chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee put him in a position to oversee the proceedings for both impeachments of former President Donald Trump.

The defendants, Aimee Harris, 40, and Robert Kurlander, 58, conspired to steal items from Florida and transport them over state lines in September 2020, when Ashley's father was the Democratic nominee for the White House, according to a charging document. Kurlander as part of his plea in U.S. District Court in Manhattan agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors, who are continuing to investigate how the diary was obtained by Project Veritas, the right-wing group that specializes in provocative videos and investigations designed to embarrass media outlets and other targets. Neither Biden was identified by name in the charging document released Thursday. But the details of the case match with what has been previously reported about an investigation by federal prosecutors in New York into the theft of Ashley's diary, which occurred weeks before the 2020 presidential election. The charging document says the father of the theft's victim was a \"then-former government official who was a candidate for national office.\" President Biden is a former U.S. senator and vice president. Ashley's diary, which she had left in a Delray Beach, Florida, home she was renting, and other items were ultimately sold for $40,000 to Project Veritas, which has offices in Mamaroneck, New York. Harris, who is a resident of Palm Beach, later temporarily stayed at the same residence where Ashley had lived, and discovered items that included a journal with \"highly personal entries\" and a digital storage card that the victim left behind, according to the charging document. The charging document says Project Veritas purchased the stolen property from Harris and the Jupiter resident Kurlander paid each of them $20,000. The charging document says that Harris asked Kurlander for his assistance in selling certain items of the victim's property. The document said that Harris and Kurlander in September 2020 attended a campaign fundraiser in Florida for a person, identified as Candidate-2, who was running against the victim's father. That fundraiser is understood to be one held for then-President Donald Trump. Four days later, a representative from Trump's campaign told Harris and Kurlander that the campaign was not interested in buying the stolen property, the charging document says. Kurlander then texted Harris, saying, \"[Candidate-2] campaign can't use it. They want it to go to the FBI. There is NO WAY [Candidate-2] can use this. It has to be done a different way.\" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement Thursday, \"Harris and Kurlander stole personal property from an immediate family member of a candidate for national political office.\" \"They sold the property to an organization in New York for $40,000 and even returned to take more of the victim's property when asked to do so,\" Williams said. \"Harris and Kurlander sought to profit from their theft of another person's personal property, and they now stand convicted of a federal felony as a result,\" he said. Both defendants face a possible maximum sentence of five years in prison on the charge of conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property. They each agreed to forfeit $20,000 as part of their guilty pleas. FBI agents last November searched several locations that belonged to current and former members of Project Veritas as part of the probe of the Biden diary theft. Project Veritas CEO James O'Keefe, in a statement issued at that time, said that the organization had been approached by people offering it the Biden diary. But O'Keefe said the group decided not to publish the contents of the diary, and later turned it over to law enforcement when Ashley's lawyer refused to accept it. \"At the end of the day, we made the ethical decision that because, in part, we could not determine if the diary was real, if the diary in fact belonged to Ashley Biden, or if the contents of the diary occurred, we could not publish the diary and any part thereof,\" O'Keefe said at the time."},

The decision will affect flights by Xiamen, Air China, China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines from Sept. 5 to Sept. 28. The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) cited the recent cancellation of 26 American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines flights over Covid-19 cases. The suspensions include 19 China-bound flights from Los Angeles and 7 China Eastern flights from New York. The Chinese Embassy in Washington's spokesperson Liu Pengyu said the USDOT action was \"extremely irresponsible\" and \"groundlessly suspended Chinese airline flights.\" The embassy said China's Covid-19 \"circuit breaker\" measures were fair and transparent, applied both to Chinese and foreign airlines and were consistent with bilateral air transportation agreements. USDOT said as of Aug. 7 Chinese authorities had revised their policies so if the number of passengers on a flight to China testing positive for Covid-19 reached 4% of the total, one flight would be suspended. If it reached 8%, two flights would be suspended. USDOT said the U.S. has repeatedly raised objections with China, saying the rules place \"undue culpability on carriers\" when travelers test negative before boarding their flight from the United States only to \"test positive for Covid-19 after their arrival in China.\" Beijing and Washington have sparred over air services since the start of the pandemic. In January, the Transportation Department suspended 44 China-bound flights from the United States by the four Chinese carriers in response to China's decision suspend 44 flights by U.S. carriers. In August 2021, USDOT limited four flights from Chinese carriers to 40% passenger capacity for four weeks after Beijing imposed identical limits on four United Airlines flights. Three U.S. airlines and four Chinese carriers typically operate about 20 flights a week between the countries, well below the figure of more than 100 a week before the pandemic."},

The DOJ's suggestions had been requested by a magistrate judge in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, who is considering requests from media outlets and others to unseal the affidavit, which led to the Aug. 8 raid on Trump's home at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach. The DOJ's proposal, which itself will remain under seal for now by court order, was expected to suggest extensive blacking out of portions of the affidavit because of the department's concern that full public disclosure of the document could put FBI agents or witnesses at risk, or undermine an ongoing criminal investigation. The DOJ is probing the removal of hundreds of pages of documents from the White House when Trump left office in January 2021. Presidential documents by law are required to be turned over to the National Archives and Records Administration. Court documents have revealed the DOJ is investigating possible violations of laws related to espionage and obstruction of justice. Affidavits filed in support of search warrant applications routinely include details of why the FBI and prosecutors believe a crime has likely been committed, and what evidence they expect or hope to find at the location that is the target of the warrant. During the raid on Mar-a-Lago, FBI agents seized about a dozen boxes of material. Court records indicate that the documents seized included material that was marked top secret. \"The United States has filed a submission under seal per the Court's order of Aug. 22,\" DOJ spokesman Anthony Coley said in a statement Thursday. \"The Justice Department respectfully declines further comment as the Court considers the matter,\" he said. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart, who authorized the raid and is presiding over issues related to the warrant, has indicated he is likely to unseal at least portions of the affidavit. \"I cannot say at this point that partial redactions will be so extensive that they will result in a meaningless disclosure, but I may ultimately reach that conclusion after hearing further from the government,\" Reinhart wrote in an order Monday. Shortly after the proposal was filed, a group of media companies filed a motion asking the judge to unseal portions of the DOJ's legal brief arguing for the redactions. \"Like the search warrant affidavit itself, the Brief is a judicial record to which a presumption of public access applies,\" that motion by the media groups said. \"As this Court has already recognized, there is an 'intense public and historical interest in an unprecedented search of a former President's residence,' and the government bears the burden of demonstrating that 'a sufficiently important interest in secrecy\" justifies sealing,' \" the motion said. The media groups include NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC."},

Marjorie Taylor Greene early Thursday morning, the second \"swatting\" call targeting the Republican congresswoman in two days, authorities confirmed. Two officers showed up to Greene's home in Rome, Georgia, after receiving a call at 2:53 a.m. ET Thursday about \"a male possibly shooting his family members and then himself,\" according to a report from the Rome Police Department. The suspect, who called through an internet chat that appeared to be a suicide crisis line, falsely told police responders that a man \"came out as trans-gender and claimed they shot the family\" at Greene's address, the report said. \"If anyone tried to stop me from shooting myself, I will shoot them,\" said the caller, who gave officers the name Wayne Greene and warned that \"they would be waiting for us,\" according to the police report. The officers went to Greene's house and met her at her front door, where they explained the situation, the report said. They \"confirmed this was a second false report,\" the department said in a press statement. Officers could not see a location used in the suicide chat line \"due to the person(s) using a VPN,\" the report said. The department said it is working with the U.S. Capitol Police on the investigation, which remains active. Greene revealed in a tweet Thursday morning that she was \"swatted again last night.\" Her spokesman, Nick Dyer, told CNBC he could confirm the incident. \"Our number one concern is the safety of Congresswoman Greene and her family,\" read a statement from Greene's office, which described the calls as \"violent crimes\" even though no violence occurred. The far-right lawmaker, who represents Georgia's 14th Congressional District and is supported by former President Donald Trump, was targeted in the first swatting call around 1 a.m. ET on Wednesday by an alleged opponent of her stance on transgender rights, police said. That caller falsely claimed that a man had been shot multiple times in a bathtub at Greene's residence. Afterward, the department received a second call from that suspect, who was using a computer-generated voice as they claimed responsibility for the incident. The suspect \"explained that they were upset about Ms. Greene's stance on 'trans-gender youth's rights', and stated that they were trying to 'SWAT' her,\" the police report said. Greene had introduced a bill in Congress last week that would make it a felony to provide gender-affirming care to transgender minors. The legislation came amid a growing right-wing movement against those treatments that recently targeted Boston Children's Hospital, which said last week that it is dealing with an influx of hostile calls and emails, including threats of violence. Greene later Thursday morning railed against media outlets that have criticized her politics on transgender issues. \"Those media companies, they're responsible for trying to get me killed by those horrific headlines,\" she said in an interview with Steve Bannon, a right-wing media host and former top Trump advisor. \"The disgusting left, MSNBCs and the NBCs, putting headlines up there that I'm targeting trans kids, that is the biggest lie, and I should sue them for saying such things,\" Greene said.

Biden will cancel up to $20,000 for recipients of Pell Grants. \"Both of these targeted actions are for families who need it the most,\" the president said in remarks from the White House on Wednesday afternoon. The relief will be limited to Americans earning under $125,000 per year, or $250,000 for married couples or heads of households. The relief is also capped at the amount of a borrower's outstanding eligible debt, per the Education Department. The president will also extend the payment pause on most federal student loans \"one final time\" through Dec. 31, 2022, according to the tweet. In his remarks, Biden said that 95% of borrowers would benefit from the plan, or about 43 million people. Of those, over 60% are Pell Grant recipients. In all, nearly 45% of borrowers, or almost 20 million people, would have their debt fully canceled, Biden said. \"That's 20 million people who can start getting on with their lives,\" Biden said. \"All of this means people can start finally to crawl out from under that mountain of debt. To get on top of their rent and their utilities. To finally think about buying a home or starting a family or starting a business.\" Biden's decision to move ahead with $10,000 in student debt cancellation for borrowers who earn under $125,000 will cost the federal government around $244 billion, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. The $20,000 in relief for Pell Grant recipients may add around $120 billion to the government's costs. The unprecedented action by the White House of wiping out hundreds of billions of dollars in consumer debt follows years of advocacy pressure and recent months of heated debate among Biden administration officials. Those discussions centered on how student loan forgiveness might impact the high inflation hitting Americans' wallets, the amount of student debt that should be canceled and if the president even had the power to reduce people's balances without the legislative branch.

Advocates have said that forgiving student debt will galvanize younger voters, among whom Biden has been losing popularity, to the polls. Although the president had been pushed to cancel $50,000 or more per person, including by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and groups such as the NAACP, he had repeatedly expressed reluctance to wipe out that much debt for all borrowers. When the coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S. in March 2020 and crippled the economy, the Trump administration put federal student loan payments on pause. That pause has since been extended six times, and Biden's White House chief of staff, Ron Klain, said earlier this year that the president would make his decision on student loan forgiveness before payments resume in September. \"The student loan crisis\" has become a familiar term in the mouths of politicians and in households across the U.S. More than 40 million Americans are in debt for their education, owing a cumulative $1.7 trillion, a balance that far exceeds outstanding credit card or auto debt. Skyrocketing higher education costs coupled with stagnant wages have caused the amount of student debt people graduate with to soar. Today the average balance is over $30,000, up from $12,000 in 1980. Before the pandemic, when the U.S. economy was enjoying one of its healthiest periods in history, problems plagued the federal student loan system. Only about half of borrowers were in repayment in 2019, according to an estimate by Kantrowitz. A quarter \u2014 or more than 10 million people \u2014 were in delinquency or default, and the rest had applied for temporary relief for struggling borrowers, including deferments or forbearances. These grim figures led to comparisons to the 2008 mortgage crisis. \"The student loan system is broken,\" said Persis Yu, policy director for the Student Borrower Protection Center. Democrats and Republicans have pointed to major flaws in the federal student loan system. Problems come into play as soon as students take out loans, experts say, and more crop up in repayment. Among them: Research shows that student debt holds individuals back from starting businesses, saving for their retirement and buying homes. As a result, debt forgiveness is likely to change the life trajectory for tens of millions of Americans. Calls for broad student loan forgiveness date back to the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011, shortly before outstanding education debt surpassed $1 trillion. At the time, advocates began to question why corporations should get a bailout from the government on their debt but not everyday Americans who had sought an education. In the 2020 Democratic primary, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., rolled out a plan to forgive $50,000 for almost all borrowers on her first day in office as president. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., went further, promising to cancel all of the debt if he made it to the White House. On the campaign trail, Biden took a more conservative approach than his rivals to the left, coming out in support of $10,000 in student loan forgiveness. In office, however, the president has been under relentless pressure from Democrats and advocates to deliver deeper relief. Wisdom Cole, national director of the NAACP's youth and college division, had said that nixing just $10,000 would be \"a slap in the face\" for Black borrowers, who often have to borrow more than their white peers because of the racial wealth gap. The announcement is sure to aggravate many Americans, including those who never borrowed for their education or went to college. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee, recently called student loan forgiveness \" a giveaway to highly educated college grads.\" Some Republicans have said they will try to block an effort by the president to cancel the debt. Critics of student loan forgiveness have questioned the fairness of directing relief at those who have benefited from a college education, which usually leads to higher wages. \"Economists generally agree that widespread loan cancellation is regressive, delivering the biggest bailout to those who need it the least,\" said Beth Akers, a senior fellow at the center-right American Enterprise Institute. Forgiveness will only worsen the lending crisis, Akers added. \"The president is sending the wrong message to future borrowers who will likely expect their own bailout in the future,\" she said. \"Americans may borrow and pay more for college as a result.\" Yet advocates have said that framing student loan forgiveness as a handout to the well-off is a misinterpretation of the deep and historic inequities of the American economy. Mushrooming tuition prices coupled with stagnant household wages over the last 40 years, they argue, have forced more and more families to borrow to attend college, an increasingly necessary step to reach the middle class. \"All of these fat cats and people who never want to see help for working people and poor people come up with these myths,\" Schumer said in June, in one of his many pushes for $50,000 in student debt cancellation. \"This is not a problem that concerns the wealthy,\" Schumer said."},

Biden made one of the most influential policy decisions of his presidency Wednesday when he announced the cancellation of up to $10,000 in federal student loan debt for borrowers earning under $125,000 a year or $250,000 for married couples or heads of households. Pell Grant recipients can have up to $20,000 of debt canceled. The debt relief is capped at the amount of the borrower's outstanding debt, according to the Education Department. Some congressional Republicans immediately sought to undermine Biden's debt forgiveness plan. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., called it a \"radical agenda.\" \"Biden's debt transfer scam will make inflation even worse and does nothing to stop the runaway cost of college for most families,\" McCarthy posted on Twitter Wednesday. \"Americans cannot afford Democrats' radical agenda.\" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called the loan forgiveness policy \"unfair\" in an interview on conservative news network Newsmax TV. \"Taxpayers all over the country ... they shouldn't have to pay off the great, big student loan debt for some college student that piled up massive debt going to some Ivy League school,\" Greene said. The Georgia Republican added that Biden's debt forgiveness policy is a scheme to bring in Democratic votes during the November midterm elections. But public records show that Greene was the beneficiary of loan forgiveness in the early months of the pandemic. A Paycheck Protection Program loan of $182,200 given to Greene's company, Taylor Commercial Inc., in April 2020 was forgiven with accrued interest, according to records maintained by ProPublica. And wealthy Americans benefited from a nearly $2 trillion tax loophole after former President Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \u2014 passed by a Republican-controlled Congress \u2014 into law in 2017. Three-quarters of the benefit from the tax cuts outlined in the act would go to the top 1% of earners, per an analysis by the Tax Foundation. Biden's debt forgiveness policy is projected to cost the federal government around $244 billion, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. Forgiveness for Pell Grant recipients will cost an additional $120 billion. The debt forgiveness plan also extends the pause on student loan debt repayments to Dec. 31, 2022. Over 40 million Americans owe $1.7 trillion in student loan debt."},

The funds sent back to the SBA were obtained via the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program using both fabricated information and stolen identities. The suspects used Green Dot Bank, a fintech institution, to hold and move the fraudulent funds. More than 15,000 accounts were used in the conspiracy, by individuals in the U.S. as well as domestic and transnational organized crime rings, the agency said. Investigations are ongoing and further information about suspects was not immediately released. The investigation was initiated by the Secret Service field office in Orlando, Florida, and Green Dot bank worked with the agency to identify the fraudulent accounts. \"Fraudsters in general are always looking for ways and techniques to better do their crimes and modern conveniences are just one of those things they use. So currently, cryptocurrency is a big thing, fintechs, third-party payment systems. But there's not an institution, even our traditional financial institutions, that weren't targeted during the pandemic,\" Roy Dotson, lead investigator for the Secret Service, told CNBC in an interview. Initial investigations indicated the majority of the fraudulent accounts at Green Dot were established with synthetic and stolen identities, and involved using \"willing and unwilling money mules,\" Dotson said. The Secret Service and SBA Office of Inspector General put out advisories to 30,000 financial institutions in early 2020 to lay out fraud indicators and guide the banks to partner with federal agencies to recover fraudulent funds, Dotson said. He added these investigations will likely last years due to their size and scope. Green Dot said it has partnered with federal agencies including the Secret Service to identify fraud in the industry. \"Account protection and fraud prevention are top priorities for us, and we work around the clock and invest heavily to identify, block and address fraudulent activity. We're committed to protecting customers, and also to serving as [a] proactive ally to government agencies and industry peers as we work together to prevent fraud,\" Green Dot spokeswoman Alison Lubert said in a statement. OIG Inspector General Hannibal Ware said the partnership with the Secret Service has to date resulted in more than 400 indictments and nearly 300 convictions related to pandemic fraud. The U.S. government allocated more than $1 trillion to Main Street under both the Paycheck Protection Program and EIDL program. The PPP allowed small businesses to borrow loans that may be forgiven if the borrower used the majority of the capital on payroll, while the Covid-19 EIDL program allowed borrowers to access loans based on temporary losses of revenue due to the pandemic. An advance grant was also available under the EIDL. Reviews of the two programs by the SBA's Office of Inspector General warned that criminals would potentially exploit the system due to the fast-moving nature of the rollout and demand for aid. CNBC investigations revealed, in some cases, how easy it was for criminals to obtain fraudulent aid via stolen identities. The SBA OIG said it has identified $87 billion of potentially fraudulent EIDL loans. Over the past two years, the Secret Service said it has seized over $1.4 billion in fraudulently obtained funds and assisted in returning some $2.3 billion to state unemployment insurance programs. Nearly 4,000 pandemic-related fraud investigations and inquiries have been initiated by the Secret Service. More than 150 field offices and 40 cyber task forces are involved. \"This is not going to be a quick fix. As we talked about today, 15,325 accounts at one financial institution \u2014 this is one case, so you can just think of the potential number of suspects and how many investigations that could come out of those. And with all of our federal, state and local partners working this and having the same mission. It's going to be a long process,\" Dotson said at a news conference announcing the returned funds."},

The order Thursday came hours after the Department of Justice submitted a proposal in U.S District Court for the Southern District of Florida detailing how it wanted portions of that affidavit kept secret if the document were to be made public. That proposal itself is sealed, making it impossible to know what the DOJ wants to be kept hidden in the search warrant affidavit. But Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart in his order wrote that he agreed the DOJ \"has met its burden\" in showing there was a compelling reason to keep portions of the affidavit out of the public eye. Reinhart said the redactions were warranted because disclosure would reveal the identities of law enforcement agents, witnesses, and uncharged parties, as well as \"the investigation's strategy\" and direction, and \"grand jury information.\" FBI agents, carrying the warrant issued on the basis of the affidavit, on Aug. 8 raided Trump's residence at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach. They seized a dozen or so boxes of documents as part of a criminal investigation of the removal of presidential records from the White House when he left office in January 2021. Many of those documents were highly classified. The DOJ probe is eyeing possible obstruction of justice and violations of the U.S. espionage act and the law prohibiting the removal of official records. By law, presidential records must be given to the National Archives and Records Administration when a president leaves office. A group of media organizations had asked Reinhart to unseal the entire affidavit. That document, like other such affidavits submitted with search warrant applications, would detail why authorities believed there was probable cause that a crime had been committed. The affidavit also would describe what evidence authorities believed might be at the target location. But Reinhart, in his order Thursday, wrote, \"I further find that the Government has met its burden of showing that its proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to serve the Government's legitimate interest in the integrity of the ongoing investigation and are the least onerous alternative to sealing the entire Affidavit.\""},

Mark Kelly in November's election, according to people familiar with the matter. Masters has received urgent private calls in recent weeks from GOP leaders like Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, these people explained. The NRSC is the official campaign arm for the Senate GOP, and has spent over $6 million taking on Masters' rival Kelly, according to data from the nonpartisan OpenSecrets. Kelly's seat has long been considered a potential pickup opportunity for Republicans, as forecaster Cook Political Report labels the race a toss-up. Recent polling, however, suggests that Masters is falling behind. A Fox News poll taken in August shows Kelly leading Masters by 8 points, while an Arizona Republican pollster told NBC News that his own surveys showed Masters trailing Kelly by 10 points. Longtime GOP megadonors, who want to help Masters overtake Kelly but have not heard from him since he won the party's primary, have inundated the Republican candidate with calls, these people explained. A person familiar with one of the recent calls to Masters said a veteran GOP financier \"read him the riot act\" and told him, in part, that he must start raising money from more wealthy Republican donors and stop relying on billionaire tech executive Peter Thiel, his longtime colleague and friend, to help him like he did in the primary. These people declined to be named in order to speak freely about private conversations. Shortly after publication of this story, Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for the Masters campaign, denied that the candidate ever heard from a GOP megadonor who \"read him the riot act.\" Miller told CNBC in an email: \"It didn't happen.\" Kelly has massively outraised Masters, who won a Republican primary in Arizona this month. The incumbent's campaign has amassed more than $54 million during the 2022 election cycle, compared with just over $4 million for Masters' campaign, according to the latest Federal Election Commission data. Thiel contributed $15 million during the primary to a pro-Masters super PAC, Saving Arizona, and he donated $1.5 million to the committee as recently as July. Masters was the chief operating officer at Thiel Capital, an investment firm founded by Thiel. The calls to Masters come as even some Republican leaders seem to be questioning their Senate candidates. When asked about his predictions for the midterms, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said\"candidate quality\" has a lot to do with winning Senate elections. He added that he believes there will be an \"extremely close Senate\" after November's elections. The Senate is currently split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans. In a statement to CNBC, NRSC spokesman Chris Hartline did not deny that Scott called Masters to urge him to improve his fundraising operation. \"Mark Kelly votes with Joe Biden almost 100% of the time. While he claims to be a moderate, he's supported reckless Washington spending and done nothing to address the border crisis that's raging in Arizona. The NRSC will continue to remind Arizona voters of Mark Kelly's radical agenda and Blake Masters' plans to fight for Arizona families,\" Hartline said in response to questions about Scott's contact with Masters. Data from ad tracker AdImpact shows that the NRSC has booked just over $3.8 million in ads in Arizona for September, but nothing yet for October or November. The ad tracker also shows that Masters' campaign has not yet booked airtime for the fall while Kelly's team has reserved over $10 million in ad space from September through November. AdImpact says it has not yet seen data showing the Thiel-backed Saving Arizona reserve airtime for the fall. The last spending it saw from the super PAC was on Aug. 2, the day of the Arizona Senate Republican primary. The super PAC spent over $10 million during the primary, including almost $8.5 million backing Masters, according to OpenSecrets. Masters and his campaign did not return requests for comment. A spokesman for Saving Arizona did not return requests for comment. Thiel and his spokesman did not return requests for comment, including about whether the billionaire GOP donor plans to help Masters further. The candidates and outside groups from both sides of the aisle have combined to spend over $90 million in the general election Senate race in Arizona. Yet Democratic organizations appear to be outspending their Republican rivals in the Grand Canyon State on ads in the coming months. AdImpact's data shows Democratic outside groups are reserving nearly $28 million worth of ad time in Arizona over the next three months. Republican committees have so far spent just over $16 million on ad buys within the same time span trying to help Masters overtake Kelly, according to the data."},

The previously unreported photo, released by the War College to Reuters after a request under the Freedom of Information Act, showed Mastriano in a 2013-14 portrait for the Department of Military Strategy, Plans, and Operations, where he worked. Faculty at the time had been given the option of dressing as a historical figure, people familiar with the photo said. At least 15 of the 21 faculty in the photo opted to appear in regular attire. Although one man wears a trench coat and sunglasses and another carries an aviator's helmet, Mastriano is the only one wearing a Confederate uniform. Mastriano did not immediately respond to requests for comment made by email and phone. A Reuters reporter attended a Mastriano event on Wednesday to seek comment, but the candidate did not make himself available for questions. Displays of Confederate symbols can be seen as insensitive to those who view them as painful reminders of racial oppression and the Civil War that saw 11 rebelling Confederate states fight to keep Black people enslaved. The U.S. military issued a de facto ban on displaying the Confederate flag and has sought to remove segregationist symbols from bases and academic institutions following the murder in May 2020 of George Floyd, a Black man whose killing by a white police officer in Minneapolis triggered protests worldwide. After Reuters made its formal request for the photo, it was removed from the War College wall where it had hung alongside other annual portraits of faculty groups. The Army War College (AWC), a premier military higher education institution in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, told Reuters a team had reviewed all art, text, and other images displayed at Carlisle Barracks in 2020, but missed the faculty photo. \"The faculty photo did not get the team's attention; the photo has since been removed because it does not meet AWC values,\" the college said in a statement. Asked about the War College photo, a spokesperson at U.S. Army headquarters said: \"The Army supports commanders who remove symbols or images that do not comport with Army values.\" Confederate symbols and dress have been embraced by white supremacists in the United States, and monuments and flags honoring the Confederacy have been removed from many public areas in recent years. Pennsylvania plays an outsized role in U.S. politics as a so-called swing state in presidential elections, and Republican Mastriano, who has embraced Trump's stolen election lies, is trailing his Democratic opponent in the governor's race ahead of the November ballot. It is unclear how the photo might be viewed in Pennsylvania, which played a critical role in the Civil War. More than 33,000 soldiers from Pennsylvania died fighting for the Union, and the state was the site of the Battle of Gettysburg, the conflict's bloodiest battle, which ended with a Union victory and inspired President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. Mastriano's district, Pennsylvania's 33rd, includes Gettysburg. Many Americans continue to participate in Civil War battle re-enactments, wearing uniforms from both sides in an effort to preserve U.S. history."},

The FBI had probable cause to believe that records containing classified national defense information would be found at the Palm Beach, Florida, residence, according to an agent who wrote the 32-page affidavit. \"There is also probable cause to believe that evidence of obstruction will be found\" at Trump's home, read an unredacted portion of the affidavit. A federal judge had ordered the key document's release over the objections of the DOJ, which argued it contains highly sensitive facts about the ongoing criminal investigation into Trump. U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart accepted the DOJ's proposed redactions to the affidavit one day before it was made public. Click here or scroll down to read the heavily redacted affidavit. \"The government is conducting a criminal investigation concerning the improper removal and storage of classified information in unauthorized spaces, as well as the unlawful concealment and removal of government records,\" the FBI agent, whose name was blacked out, wrote in the affidavit's first line. The agent then wrote that the probe began because of a referral from the National Archives and Records Administration in February, after NARA received 15 boxes of records from Trump's residence in Florida. By law, presidential records must be turned over to the National Archives when a president departs office. The FBI found that in those boxes were documents that bore classification markings, and included records relating to national defense information, which had been stored at Mar-a-Lago in an unsecured location. The 15 boxes included 184 specific documents marked classified, 67 of which were marked \"confidential,\" 92 marked \"secret\" and 25 documents marked \"top secret,\" according to the affidavit. \"Based upon this investigation, I do not believe that any spaces within the PREMISES have been authorized for the storage of classified information at least since the end of FPOTUS 's Presidential Administration on January 20, 2021,\" the agent wrote in the affidavit. Of the 32 pages of the affidavit, 21 pages are almost totally or significantly blacked out. The search warrant itself was revealed voluntarily by the DOJ less than a week after the Aug. 8 raid. The warrant indicated that FBI agents were looking for materials showing violations of laws against obstruction of justice and the removal of official records, as well as the U.S. Espionage Act. The FBI took at least 20 boxes of items in the August raid, including numerous sets of highly classified documents, according to a property receipt that was also made public by the DOJ. In a social media post after the redacted affidavit was released, Trump accused the FBI and DOJ of \"public relations subterfuge\" by the fact that the word \"Nuclear\" did not appear in the document \u2014 though he also noted that it was \"heavily redacted!!!\" The affidavit did not detail the specific content of documents it expected to find. Trump also lashed out at Reinhart, arguing that he should have recused himself from this matter because he had previously removed himself from another case involving the former president. The reason for that recusal was not clear, news outlets reported, but Trump claimed it was \"based on his animosity and hatred of your favorite President, me.\" The government argued last week against releasing the affidavit, even in a redacted form. \"The redactions necessary to mitigate harms to the integrity of the investigation would be so extensive as to render the remaining unsealed text devoid of meaningful content,\" read a court filing from Jay Bratt, head of the counterintelligence and export control section of the DOJ's National Security Division. Bratt also argued that the affidavit \"would serve as a roadmap to the government's ongoing investigation\" if disclosed. Reinhart disagreed, and ordered the government to propose redactions to U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach, Florida, by Thursday. The judge accepted the DOJ's redactions later that day. The government said last week that the Mar-a-Lago raid is part of a probe that \"implicates national security\" and is still in its \"early stages.\" Trump, who first revealed the FBI's search of his Florida residence, has cast himself as the victim of a political attack by the Biden administration that was carried out against the presumptive Republican front-runner in the 2024 presidential race. The former president on Monday sued the government, asking a federal judge to block the DOJ from poring over the documents seized from Mar-a-Lago until a court-appointed third party reviews them. \"The political Hacks and Thugs had no right under the Presidential Records Act to storm Mar-a-Lago and steal everything in sight, including Passports and privileged documents,\" Trump said in a social media post earlier Friday morning.

The judge scheduled a Thursday hearing to discuss the matter further. A special master is often a former judge.

The Justice Department argued in a court filing that Trump lacks the legal standing to appoint a special master. Appointing that watchdog could harm national security, the agency warned. The department also said it has evidence that government records likely were concealed and removed from a storage room at Trump's home at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, \"and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation.\" Trump had sued to block the Justice Department from further investigating any materials taken in the raid until a court-appointed special master is able to analyze them. That step is typically taken when there is a chance that some evidence should be withheld from prosecutors because of various legal privileges. \"As an initial matter, the former President lacks standing to seek judicial relief or oversight as to Presidential records because those records do not belong to him,\" the DOJ wrote to Judge Aileen Cannon in U.S. District Court in southern Florida. Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, has set a hearing for Thursday at 1 p.m. ET in a West Palm Beach courthouse. Trump's legal team has until Wednesday night to reply to the DOJ's latest submission. The DOJ is conducting a criminal investigation of the removal of White House documents and their shipment to Trump's residence at Mar-a-Lago when he left office. By law, presidential records must be turned over to the National Archives and Records Administration when a president departs office. The National Archives and Records Administration retrieved 15 boxes of records from Mar-a-Lago in January. The next month, NARA sent a referral to the DOJ that the records contained \"highly classified documents intermingled with other records,\" according to the affidavit used to obtain the warrant for the Aug. 8 search of Trump's home. The DOJ said in Tuesday night's filing that the FBI had \"uncovered multiple sources of evidence indicating ... that classified documents remained\" at Mar-a-Lago. \"The government also developed evidence that government records were likely concealed and removed from the Storage Room and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation,\" the DOJ wrote. That evidence contradicted a sworn certification letter on June 3 from the custodian of Trump's records, claiming that \"any and all\" documents responsive to a grand jury subpoena had been handed over, the DOJ wrote. The August search \"cast serious doubt on the claim in the certification ... that there had been 'a diligent search' for records responsive to the grand jury subpoena,\" according to the DOJ's filing. Of the evidence taken in that raid, \"over one hundred unique documents with classification markings \u2014 that is, more than twice the amount produced on June 3, 2022, in response to the grand jury subpoena \u2014 were seized,\" the DOJ wrote. \"That the FBI, in a matter of hours, recovered twice as many documents with classification markings as the 'diligent search' that the former President's counsel and other representatives had weeks to perform calls into serious question the representations made in the June 3 certification and casts doubt on the extent of cooperation in this matter,\" the DOJ wrote. The prosecutors also argued against the appointment of a special master, saying it is \"unnecessary\" and that doing so \"would significantly harm important governmental interests, including national security interests.\" That harm could include impeding the intelligence community's \"ongoing review of the national security risk\" that may have been caused by \"improper storage of these highly sensitive materials,\" the DOJ argued. The prosecutors concluded that Cannon should reject Trump's requests \"and decline to require the return of seized items, enjoin further review of seized materials, or appoint a special master.\" Tuesday's filing came one day after the DOJ told Cannon that its review of the seized materials was complete. The DOJ told the court on Monday that a law enforcement team had identified a \"limited set\" of materials that may be protected by attorney-client privilege. That privilege often refers to the legal doctrine that protects the confidentiality of communications between an attorney and their client. The so-called privilege review team \u2014 which is separate from the investigation that led the FBI to search Trump's residence earlier this month \u2014 is following a process to \"address potential privilege disputes, if any,\" the DOJ wrote. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence \"is also leading an intelligence community assessment of the potential risk to national security that would result from the disclosure of these materials,\" according to the filing. Before the DOJ posted its late-night response, a group of former government officials asked the judge to let them file a brief as \"amici curiae\" \u2014 Latin for \"friends of the court\" \u2014 arguing against Trump's requests. The group included six former federal prosecutors who served in Republican administrations, as well as former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who governed as a Republican but backed President Joe Biden over Trump in 2020."},

Charlie Crist announced Wednesday he will resign from Congress as he campaigns to unseat Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in November. The move will shrink Democrats' already-slim majority in the House, potentially complicating efforts to pass more legislation before the midterm elections when Republicans are currently favored to take control. Serving in Congress \"has been an honor and a privilege,\" Crist said in a statement, which did not mention his campaign for governor. \"From the bottom of my heart, thank you for trusting me as your Representative in Washington.\" Crist will step down by the close of business Wednesday, he said in the statement. Congressional staff for Crist's district will provide casework and constituent services until the next representatives are sworn in in January, the statement said. Florida's 13th Congressional District, where Crist has served since 2017, is considered a likely pickup for Republicans this November, according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. The district's political makeup shifted toward the GOP after a new congressional map, proposed by DeSantis, re-shaped the area. Crist handily won the Democratic nomination for Florida's gubernatorial race. But polls show him trailing DeSantis, a dominant figure in the GOP who is widely rumored to be gearing up for a 2024 presidential run. DeSantis has also far outraised Crist: The powerful Republican incumbent governor's campaign has raised more than $165 million since 2019, OpenSecrets reported earlier this month. DeSantis' stature in the party is exceeded perhaps only by former President Donald Trump, who has regularly teased the possibility of launching another White House bid.

The former TV personality's vocal support for the energy business follows years of industry donations to his nonprofit and then his campaign, according to financial records reviewed by CNBC. Oz also has a personal stake in oil and gas through investments in two major energy companies, according to his financial disclosures. Pennsylvania's next senator will be a key vote for the energy industry, as it has a major presence in the Keystone State. Pennsylvania is the nation's second-largest natural gas producer after Texas and the third-largest coal producer, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Oz backed the energy industry this year as Americans felt the strain from spiking gas prices. In a recent interview, he ripped President Joe Biden after he called on companies that run gas stations to bring down prices at the pump. \"Now, they're blaming the energy companies for the gas prices. And I'm thinking, like most Americans, what are you talking about? I mean, you did things that make it, make it impossible for these companies to exist,\" Oz said in a July interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity. He called Biden's comments \"class warfare.\" As Oz champions oil and gas in his bid to represent Pennsylvania in the Senate, both his campaign and personal coffers have benefited from the industry and its executives. Oz, a veteran physician and television host, is running against Democrat John Fetterman for a Senate seat being vacated by Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. Oz is trailing Fetterman by just under 8 percentage points in an average of recent polls, according to RealClearPolitics. Fetterman's campaign has raised over $25 million, while Oz and his team have brought in just over $18 million, according to data from the nonpartisan OpenSecrets. Oz and his wife, Lisa, have a financial stake in the industry he has championed, as they own shares of oil and gas giants ConocoPhillips and Pioneer Natural Resources, according to their financial disclosure report. The filing notes they own shares of ConocoPhillips valued between $15,001 and $50,000 and Pioneer stock valued between $1,001 and $15,000. Oz's connections to the industry formed before he pursued politics. His nonprofit HealthCorps, which promotes itself as a group aiming to help teens with their health and wellness, has seen at least $210,000 in contributions from gas and oil producer Continental Resources since 2016, according to the group's annual financial reports. Continental's support has continued into Oz's Senate bid: The company's founder and chair, Harold Hamm, endorsed Oz for Senate in an April campaign video. The backing from energy industry leaders has led to contributions to Oz's campaign. Hamm is among a group of over a dozen oil and gas industry leaders who have combined to contribute over $200,000 to Oz's campaign since he announced his run for Senate late last year, according to a CNBC review of Federal Election Commission filings. Others with ties to the oil and gas business who have donated at least $2,900 to Oz's campaign include Jimmy Haslam, an owner of the Cleveland Browns and chair of Pilot Company, a business that owns fueling stations across the country. His father and Pilot founder, James Haslam II, also donated to the Oz campaign. Other top energy donors in recent months include Brad Cox, the chair of oil producer Cox Operating, and Janet Cafaro, the president of Silcor Oilfield Services, FEC records show. Jimmy Haslam and his wife, Susan \"Dee\" Haslam, combined to give $50,000 to the pro-Oz super PAC American Leadership Action. Jimmy and Dee Haslam told CNBC in a statement that they have \"tremendous respect for the long, successful career Dr. Oz has had in the private sector and appreciate that he now wants to serve his country by bringing his expertise and experience to the United States Senate.\" The Haslam family, as of 2015, had a net worth of $6 billion, according to Forbes. Representatives for Cox and Cafaro did not return requests for comment. Hamm told CNBC in a statement that he considers Oz a \"friend.\" He said the two have known each other for almost a decade, with the goal of bringing HealthCorps' services into Oklahoma schools. Hamm explained that he believes Oz will be a key advocate for the energy sector, which has enriched the oil billionaire. He and his family have a net worth of at least $21 billion, according to Forbes. \"Dr. Oz will champion American energy in the U.S. Senate much like he's championed health his entire career,\" Hamm said. The nonprofit's annual reports from 2016 through 2020 give a range of how much donors contributed to HealthCorps. Continental Resources regularly ranked among the Oz group's top backers. The company is often listed as donating between $50,000 and $99,999 during those years. A HealthCorps filing says it received a range of $10,000 to just under $25,000 from Continental in 2018. In its earlier filings before 2016, HealthCorps lists Continental as either a \"national\" or a \"community\" sponsor. The group's website notes that its national sponsors contribute $1 million and its community donors write checks for $250,000. The disclosures pre-2016 do not say or show a range of how much the company gave those years. Oz's support from the massive energy industry coincides with an apparent shift in his opinion on fracking, which allows companies to drill deep into the earth for oil and gas resources. Critics say that fracking hurts the environment by harming water supplies and polluting the air. Before Oz ran for Senate, he repeatedly wrote columns that took aim at fracking, noting its potential threat to public health, Vice reports. \"And in Pennsylvania, there are multiple reports of air and water contamination, possibly from hydraulic fracturing sites, causing folks breathing problems, rashes, headaches, nosebleeds, numbness, nausea and vomiting,\" Oz said in a 2014 column critical of fracking. Brittany Yanick, a spokeswoman for the Oz campaign, said the candidate has not changed his view on fracking and is a strong supporter of the drilling method. She also took aim at Fetterman's position on the issue. \"As a scientist, Dr. Oz understands that, like with COVID, the Biden administration is ignoring the science and the benefits of natural gas in order to satisfy the radical Left, the same liberal Democrats that are supporting radical environmental measures and funding John Fetterman's campaign,\" Yanick said in an emailed statement. \"John Fetterman has called fracking a 'stain' on Pennsylvania, he's called for a moratorium on fracking, and he would be a rubber stamp for the failing Biden Agenda.\" Fetterman has a mixed history with where he stands on fracking. Inside Climate News reported that Fetterman dropped his support for a fracking moratorium after his failed 2016 primary run for Senate. His position evolved after the state moved toward stricter regulations on fracking. Emilia Rowland, a spokeswoman for Fetterman's campaign, told CNBC that \"John does not support a ban on fracking in Pennsylvania and that includes a moratorium on new fracking sites.\" She said he hasn't taken any campaign money from the fossil fuel industry. \"John believes fully heartedly that we have to preserve the union way of life for the thousands of workers currently employed by the natural gas industry in Pennsylvania and the communities where they live. We can't just abandon these people, and tell them to go learn how to code,\" Rowland said in a statement. \"It's a total false choice that we have to choose between jobs and a clean environment. That's just not true. We can have both.\" Still, Oz appears more vocal than Fetterman in publicly supporting the oil and gas industry. In a recent op-ed, he said it's \"gross, and deeply unpatriotic\" for oil companies to charge high gas prices while their businesses are making massive profits. Fetterman namechecked Chevron, Exxon and Shell in the op-ed. Oz has rubbed elbows with industry officials during his campaign. He was invited to a June \"energy industry meet and greet\" by longtime lobbyist Missy Edwards. The invite says the meeting was set to take place at Edwards' offices in Washington. Her current clients include Southern Company and General Motors, OpenSecrets says. A spokeswoman for General Motors said she was \"not sure if GM had a representative in attendance.\" Edwards and a representative for Southern Company did not return requests for comment."},

The narrowly focused filing in U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach came one day after the Department of Justice argued that appointing a special master could harm the government's national security interests. The DOJ's filing also said that \"efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation\" into the records that had been shipped to Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence after the end of his presidency. And the DOJ revealed that the FBI seized more than 100 classified documents from the Palm Beach resort during its search of the premises earlier this month. The agency also shared a redacted FBI photo showing documents with classification markings that had been recovered from a container in Trump's \"45 Office.\" Trump's legal team in its Wednesday night reply accused the DOJ of twisting \"the framework of responding to a motion for a Special Master into an all-encompassing challenge to any judicial consideration, presently or in the future, of any aspect of its unprecedented behavior in this investigation.\" The government's \"extraordinary document\" suggests \"that the DOJ, and the DOJ alone, should be entrusted with the responsibility of evaluating its unjustified pursuit of criminalizing a former President's possession of personal and Presidential records in a secure setting,\" Trump's lawyers wrote. They also accused the DOJ of providing multiple \"misleading or incomplete statement[s] of purported 'fact,'\" but offered few specifics. Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, has set a hearing for Thursday at 1 p.m. ET in a West Palm Beach courthouse. Trump had sued to block the Justice Department from further investigating any materials taken in the Mar-a-Lago raid until a special master is able to analyze them. That step is typically taken when there is a chance that some evidence should be withheld from prosecutors because of various legal privileges. The DOJ told the judge on Monday that its review of the seized materials was complete, and that a law enforcement team had identified a \"limited set\" of materials that may be protected by attorney-client privilege. That privilege often refers to the legal doctrine that protects the confidentiality of communications between an attorney and their client. Trump's lawyers responded Wednesday that the so-called privilege review team was \"wholly deficient\" in identifying and separating all potentially privileged documents from the rest of the seized materials. Trump and his office have publicly claimed that he declassified all the documents that had been seized by the FBI. But Trump's legal team has not made that explicit argument in the civil lawsuit before Cannon. The DOJ in Tuesday's late-night filing said that when 15 boxes were retrieved from Mar-a-Lago by the National Archives in January, Trump \"never asserted executive privilege over any of the documents nor claimed that any of the documents in the boxes containing classification markings had been declassified.\" The government also said that no claims about declassification were made when FBI agents went to Mar-a-Lago on June 3, pursuant to a grand jury subpoena to collect any more records in Trump's possession that bore classification markings. The DOJ said it obtained that subpoena in May, after the FBI developed evidence that dozens of boxes with classified information \u2014 beyond the 15 boxes retrieved in January \u2014 were still at Trump's residence. \"When producing the documents, neither counsel nor the custodian asserted that the former President had declassified the documents or asserted any claim of executive privilege. Instead, counsel handled them in a manner that suggested counsel believed that the documents were classified: the production included a single Redweld envelope, double-wrapped in tape, containing the documents,\" the DOJ wrote. At the same time, Trump's custodian of records had also provided a sworn certification letter, claiming that \"any and all\" documents responsive to a grand jury subpoena had been handed over, the DOJ wrote. But the FBI later \"uncovered multiple sources of evidence\" indicating that more classified documents remained at Mar-a-Lago, according to the DOJ's filing. \"The government also developed evidence that government records were likely concealed and removed from the Storage Room and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation,\" the DOJ wrote. That and other information led the government to seek a warrant to search Mar-a-Lago, which was ultimately carried out Aug. 8. In their reply on Wednesday, Trump's lawyers wrote that the DOJ's account of the June 3 meeting \"has been significantly mischaracterized.\" \"If the Government provided the same untrue account in the affidavit in support of the search warrant, then they misled the Magistrate Judge,\" the former president's lawyers wrote. Trump, in a social media post earlier Wednesday evening, also accused the DOJ of being \"very deceiving\" by sharing a photo that appears to show numerous classified papers strewn about on a carpeted floor. Trump clarified that the FBI \"took them out of cartons and spread them around on the carpet, making it look like a big 'find' for them.\" \"They dropped them, not me - Very deceiving...And remember, we could have NO representative, including lawyers, present during the Raid. They were told to wait outside,\" Trump wrote."},

John Eastman also invoked protections under attorney-client privilege in refusing to answer at least some questions he was asked before the grand jury, which was convened as part of a criminal probe into the possibility of illegal interference in Georgia's presidential election contest, his attorneys said. Eastman is one of a group of Trump allies who were subpoenaed by that panel, which is hearing testimony in Atlanta. A second ally, Trump's former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, has been named a target in that investigation and recently testified before the same grand jury. Eastman wrote a series of memos after the 2020 election calling on then-Vice President Mike Pence to effectively undo President Joe Biden 's win by refusing to certify the Electoral College results. \"In his appearance before the Fulton County Special Grand Jury, we advised our client John Eastman to assert attorney-client privilege and the constitutional right to remain silent where appropriate,\" Eastman's lawyers, Charles Burnham and Harvey Silverglate, said in a statement. \"Out of respect for grand jury secrecy we will not disclose the substance of the questions or testimony. We wish to thank the grand jurors for their service,\" the attorneys said. The statement also blasted Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis for the probe itself. \"By all indications, the District Attorney's Office has set itself on an unprecedented path of criminalizing controversial or disfavored legal theories, possibly in hopes that the federal government will follow its lead,\" the lawyers said. \"Criminalization of unpopular legal theories is against every American tradition and would have ended the careers of John Adams, Ruth Ginsburg, Thurgood Marshall and many other now-celebrated American lawyers,\" the statement said. Adams was the second president of the United States, while Ginsburg and Marshall were Supreme Court justices who helped establish new legal precedents with their work during the civil rights movement. \"We ask all interested observers of any political persuasion to join us in decrying this troubling development,\" Burnham and Silverglate wrote. Eastman last month revealed that his cellphone was seized by federal agents who stopped him in New Mexico and forced him to unlock it. That seizure was done as part of an investigation by the Justice Department's internal watchdog, the Office of the Inspector General. The IG's office is probing the role of the Justice Department and its components in \"preparing for and responding to\" the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters, according to the office's website. That riot occurred as a joint session of Congress was convened to certify Biden's victory, with Pence presiding over the proceedings. A former Justice Department official, Jeffrey Clark, had electronics seized from his Virginia home on the same day that Eastman's phone was seized. Clark also backed Trump's effort to overturn the election. Trump considered installing Clark as attorney general in the days leading up to Jan. 6, 2021, but dropped the idea after a group of top Justice officials said they would resign in protest if that happened."},

But details of how many of those records the Mazars USA accounting firm will turn over were not included in a committee statement announcing the agreement Thursday. The deal does not cover a separate lawsuit involving the House Ways and Means Committee, which is seeking Trump's federal tax returns from 2015 through 2020. Last month, a federal appeals court said the Ways and Means Committee could get those returns. The agreement with the Oversight Committee came nearly two months after another panel of judges in the same appeals court in Washington, D.C., upheld a prior ruling that the Oversight Committee had the authority to subpoena certain of Trump's financial records from Mazars in furtherance of legislative purposes. However, the appeals court also told the committee to winnow the scope of the records it wanted to see. On Wednesday, Trump's lawyers told the court in a filing that in light of the settlement agreement with the Oversight Committee, he would drop a motion seeking a rehearing of the case, and a related one asking that the entire lineup of judges on the appeals court take up the issue. In a statement, committee Chairwoman Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said, \"After facing years of delay tactics, the Committee has now reached an agreement with the former President and his accounting firm, Mazars USA, to obtain critical documents.\" \"These documents will inform the Committee's efforts to get to the bottom of former President Trump's egregious conduct and ensure that future presidents do not abuse their position of power for personal gain,\" Maloney said. The committee said that under the agreement, \"Mazars USA has agreed to comply with the court's order and produce responsive documents to the Committee as expeditiously as possible.\" A lawyer for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The committee sought the documents in 2019 as part of its investigation into Trump's conflicts of interest involving his businesses while serving as president and his foreign financial ties. The panel issued its subpoena to Mazars for Trump's records after his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, testified to the Oversight Committee that Trump's financial statements had falsely represented his financial position. Trump then sued to block Mazars from surrendering the records. The case ended up before the Supreme Court, which in 2020 sent the lawsuit back to lower federal courts with the direction to apply a new standard for evaluating the merit of congressional subpoenas for a president's personal information."},

The wait time is a bit longer in North America, where it takes about eight days to get a new Mac, down from 18 days in June. Mac sales were short of consensus expectations in the company's third-quarter earnings report and fell 10% year over year. CEO Tim Cook attributed the drop to supply constraints, which means Apple couldn't make enough computers to meet demand. In April, Apple warned that parts shortages would hit revenue by between $4 billion and $8 billion, and Apple's website showed extended shipping times for many Mac models during the quarter. Cook said the hit ultimately came in under $4 billion. Apple also announced new MacBook Air models in June that began shipping to customers in July.

The Japanese gaming giant launched PlayStation Studios Mobile Division on Monday and said it will run independently of the console business. Sony also said on Monday it acquired Helsinki- and Berlin-based mobile game developer Savage Game Studios. The move comes after a tough second quarter for Sony's gaming division, and the company's downgrading of its full-year profit forecast for the business as the Covid-induced boom \u2014 during which people were stuck at home playing video games \u2014 begins to fade. Sony also continues to face supply chain issues and cannot meet the demand for its flagship PlayStation 5 console. Sony has dominated the console market for several years, thanks to the PlayStation. But the company is now looking to diversify. This year, the Japanese gaming giant said it plans to release around 50% of games on PC and mobile by 2025, up from about a quarter currently. \"For that to happen, Sony needs to make big bets on mobile gaming,\" Serkan Toto, CEO of Tokyo-based game industry consultancy Kantan Games, told CNBC. And the opportunity is big. Consoles account for about 27% of the $196.8 billion games market, whereas mobile makes up more than half of revenues, according to Newzoo. The purchase of Savage Game Studios continues Sony's recent acquisition drive as it looks to boost the development of titles across platforms. \"PlayStation Studios must continue to expand and diversify our offering beyond console, bringing incredible new games to more people than ever before,\" said Hermen Hulst, head of PlayStation studios. \"Acquiring the talented team at Savage Game Studios is another strategic step towards that goal.\" Sony said that Savage Game Studios is working on an \"unannounced new AAA mobile live service action game.\" A \"triple A\" game is an informal industry classification usually for a blockbuster type of title. A live service game is usually a title where developers continually update and add content to extend its lifetime and generate revenue over a longer period of time. The success of Call of Duty Mobile and Diablo Immortal on mobile, both of which were originally designed for console and PC, show there is demand for well-known titles on smaller screens \"if executed well,\" according to Daniel Ahmad, senior analyst at Niko Partners. Sony's mobile strategy is likely to lean on its massive library of intellectual property (IP) but also with a focus on developing specific games for smaller devices, Kantan Games' Toto said. \"Sony is very likely to not only bring existing PlayStation IPs to mobile but also encourage studios to develop new franchises for smart devices from scratch,\" Toto said. Sony is the latest console maker to make a big step into mobile gaming. Microsoft's Xbox gaming unit has also begun making early moves into mobile. Nintendo has, for the last three years, also been focusing a lot of effort on the smaller screen gaming format. Globally, Sony will compete with companies it hadn't really before, particularly Chinese giants Tencent and NetEase \u2014 two of the world's largest mobile gaming players. But Toto said Sony's chances of success are still high. \"The mobile gaming market is overcrowded. There are over 1 million games in app stores nowadays. But players such as Sony, even if they are new entrants, can still make it just because of their fire power,\" Toto told CNBC. \"There are not many companies like Sony out there, with such strong branding, a whole range of high-performing studios and a treasure trove of valuable IPs.\""},
{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/29/apple-iphone-14-event-preview-september-2022.html", "title": "Expect Apple to show four new iPhones and an updated Apple Watch next week", "tag": "Tech", "author": "Kif Leswing", "datetime": "2022-08-29 18:11:43", "paragraphs": " Apple is holding a launch event at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, on Sept. 7. The company is expected to announce new iPhone models, as it has every September since 2012. Apple has used prerecorded videos for its launch events since early 2020 thanks partly to Covid restrictions, and this will be the first iPhone launch with an in-person component since 2019. Apple is streaming the launch event online on its website and YouTube in addition to inviting some media to its campus. Apple's hype-filled fall launches are a signature event for Apple. They typically draw millions of simultaneous viewers on YouTube. They garner attention from around the world and set the stage for a holiday marketing blitz during the last three months of the year, which is when Apple's sales are the highest. This year's event has the tagline \"far out,\" which could refer to features such as night-sky photography. Last year, Apple released new iPhones and Apple Watches at an event in September, and then followed it up with an October launch featuring iPads and Macs. Here's what Apple is likely to launch next Wednesday, based on reports. Apple is expected to release four new iPhone models. If Apple's current naming convention holds up, they will be called the iPhone 14. This year Apple will likely discontinue the \"mini\" model with a 4.7-inch screen, according to reports. Instead, Apple could offer two sizes, one with a 6.1-inch screen and one with a 6.7-inch screen, each coming in a standard model and a pricier \"Pro\" model. The Pro models are expected to get more upgrades, according to reports from Bloomberg News, TFI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, and other analysts and Apple watchers. Since 2017, iPhones have included a space at the top of the phone's display with space for Apple's FaceID system, which includes several sensors and a camera. The Pro models could ditch Apple's \"notch\" where it houses the FaceID camera for a slimmer, more streamlined \"pill\" or \"cutout\" approach with a smaller space that has to remain blank, leaving room for an even larger display. The Pro models are also expected to get upgraded A16 processors and cameras. The camera bump is expected to get larger. Apple could release an always-on screen display for showing notifications, like some Android phones have sported for years. Beta iPhone software released over the summer suggested that Apple may be planning a similar feature because of new widgets that show weather and battery life. One of the biggest questions is how Apple will price its iPhones in a period of inflation around the world and macroeconomic uncertainty in some regions. Other consumer electronics, such as Sony's Playstation 5, have seen price cuts. Apple's least-expensive iPhone 13 model is the $699 iPhone 13 Mini, which is expected to be discontinued. That would make Apple's mainline device, which is currently the iPhone 13, the least-expensive new model at $829, if its price doesn't change. Some analysts also expect Apple to increase the price of its Pro models. Apple usually drops the price of older models when it releases new ones, giving more price-sensitive consumers an option. Apple is likely to show the eighth major new version of its watch next week. Last year, the Apple Watch Series 7 got a slightly larger screen, but the redesign did not significantly change the look and feel of the device, which has remained mostly the same since 2014. Expect more evolution this year, too. Apple is considering a body temperature sensor in the new devices, according to the Wall Street Journal, which could help with fertility and sleep tracking. Other sleep tracking features could include the ability to detect advanced sleep patterns or apnea. But the biggest Apple Watch Series 8 announcement could be a new \"Pro\" model with a bigger screen and more durable finish. Apple has previously released Apple Watches with pricey case materials such as gold, ceramic and titanium, and the new \"Pro\" model described by Bloomberg and Kuo could be one of the first high-end Apple Watches to gain additional features over its less-expensive siblings. Also likely: A new updated version of the Apple Watch SE, its $329 entry-level Watch model. IPhone owners who don't plan to buy any new gear this fall will still get an annual update to the iPhones software, iOS 16, which was announced in June and has been in testing over the summer. The software has several new features that users will immediately notice. The biggest banner feature is the ability to customize the iPhone's lock screen with widgets that can display weather forecasts, calendar appointments and other information at a glance. Users can also change the font for the lock screen clock for the first time, as well. IOS 16 also lets you unsend or edit iMessage text messages, as long as you catch them within a few minutes of sending. IOS 16 will also introduce short-term loans from Apple called Apple Pay Later. The feature will allow users to buy stuff online with Apple Pay but pay for the item in four installments without paying interest. One cool feature in iOS 16 is if a user has both an iPhone and a Mac laptop or desktop, they can use the iPhone as a very high-definition web camera. Apple is unlikely to release new iPads next week because their software isn't ready yet. Earlier this month, Apple told TechCrunch that iPadOS, the iPad software, will ship after iOS this fall, suggesting a staggered release. Apple's statement was terse, and the company dislikes talking about unannounced products. But in general, it likes to release new hardware together with new software, so the statement clearly suggested that new iPads would come at a later launch date than iPhones. IPadOS and iOS are very similar, but this year iPadOS is getting a feature called Stage Manager that could allow users to multitask more efficiently \u2014 but also got panned by early testers. Improved iPads could include more powerful processors that are closers to laptop processors, smoother displays and better integration with accessories. Apple also uncharacteristically teased a new \"Mac Pro\" in the spring. The Mac Pro is currently a $5,000 tower of power using an Intel processor. Apple wants to transition its entire Mac lineup away from Intel to its own M-series processors, but a pricey niche product doesn't fit as well with Apple's mass-market iPhones and Apple Watches. Instead, new Macs could be announced at a separate event later this year, as happened last year."},

The decision contradicts a 2019 ruling over dress code policies at Walmart that allowed the retail titan to limit (but not ban) employees from wearing pro-union insignia at work. Two members of the labor board dissented on the Tesla ruling, while three moved to overrule the prior Walmart decision. The majority wrote, \"when an employer interferes in any way with its employees' right to display union insignia, the employer must prove special circumstances that justify its interference.\" Tesla did not demonstrate special circumstances that justified its policy, the NLRB decided. Tesla had previously argued before the NLRB that its dress code was meant to prevent workers' clothing from \"causing mutilations\" to the cars or car seats they were building, and to help managers \"easily determine that employees are in their assigned work areas,\" of the company's factory. Former Tesla employees had testified before the NLRB that management at Tesla made them remove T-shirts with United Auto Workers union messages and logos on them, even though they posed no risk of damaging cars or car seats. The UAW and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday. Previously, the NLRB ruled that Tesla CEO Elon Musk violated labor laws when he suggested in a tweet that Tesla workers would need to give up their stock options if they unionized.

The \"limited set\" of potentially privileged information was identified by a team that is kept separate from the investigative squad that searched Trump's Palm Beach, Florida, residence earlier this month, DOJ officials said in a court filing in U.S. District Court in southern Florida on Monday morning. The so-called privilege review team \"completed its review of those materials\" and is following a process to \"address potential privilege disputes, if any,\" according to that filing. Attorney-client privilege often refers to the legal doctrine that protects the confidentiality of communications between an attorney and their client. The DOJ's filing provided no details about the potentially privileged materials. The agency disclosed the privilege team's review one week after Trump sued to block the DOJ from further investigating any materials taken in the raid until a court-appointed \"special master\" is able to analyze them. Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, gave notice Saturday of her \"preliminary intent to appoint a special master\" in the case. Cannon ordered the government to publicly respond to Trump by Tuesday. She also ordered the DOJ to submit a sealed filing that provides more details about the seized materials, and she set a hearing for Thursday at 1 p.m. ET in a West Palm Beach courthouse. In response, top DOJ counterintelligence official Jay Bratt assured the judge that the government will comply with those orders. But \"the government notes that, before the Court issued its Preliminary Order, and in accordance with the judicially authorized search warrant's provisions, the Privilege Review Team ... identified a limited set of materials that potentially contain attorney-client privileged information\" and \"completed its review of those materials,\" Bratt wrote. The DOJ and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, or ODNI, \"are currently facilitating a classification review of materials recovered\" from Trump's residence, Bratt added. The ODNI \"is also leading an intelligence community assessment of the potential risk to national security that would result from the disclosure of these materials,\" he wrote. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to answer reporters' specific questions about the DOJ probe later Monday, stressing that the agency is conducting its investigation independently and \"we have not been involved.\" She noted, however, neither President Joe Biden nor anyone else at the White House has been briefed on the matter, but declined to comment on any classified materials prepared for the president. Trump's civil lawsuit is being overseen by a different judge than the one who approved the search warrant for Mar-a-Lago. The affidavit for that search warrant \u2014 in which an FBI agent explained why the government had probable cause to believe the search would turn up evidence of illegality \u2014 was released Friday, albeit with heavy redactions. The National Archives and Records Administration retrieved 15 boxes of records from Mar-a-Lago in January. The next month, NARA sent a referral to the DOJ that the records contained \"highly classified documents intermingled with other records,\" according to the affidavit. By law, presidential records must be turned over to the National Archives when a president departs office. The FBI launched a criminal investigation and found that the 15 boxes included 184 specific documents marked classified, 67 of which were marked \"confidential,\" 92 marked \"secret\" and 25 marked \"top secret,\" according to the affidavit. The search warrant was revealed days after the FBI entered Mar-a-Lago in August. It indicated that FBI agents were looking for materials showing violations of laws against obstruction of justice and the removal of official records, as well as the U.S. Espionage Act. The FBI took at least 20 boxes of items in the August raid, including numerous sets of highly classified documents, according to a property receipt that was also made public by the DOJ."},

Schiff and Maloney said in a joint statement they were pleased the government was \"assessing the damage caused by the improper storage of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.\" Politico reported the letter earlier. The Justice Department on Friday disclosed that it was investigating Trump for removing White House records because it believed he illegally held documents including some involving intelligence-gathering and clandestine human sources \u2014 among America's most closely held secrets. Haines said DNI \"will also lead an Intelligence Community (IC) assessment of the potential risk to national security that would result from the disclosure of the relevant documents\" including those seized. The Justice Department on Friday released a heavily redacted affidavit that underpinned the FBI's extraordinary search of Mar-a-Lago in which agents seized 11 sets of classified records including some labeled \"top secret\" as documents that could gravely threaten national security if exposed. In the affidavit, an unidentified FBI agent said the agency reviewed and identified 184 documents \"bearing classification markings\" containing \"national defense information\" after Trump in January returned 15 boxes of government records sought by the U.S. National Archives. Other records in those boxes, according to the affidavit, bore handwritten notes by Trump. Schiff and Maloney said the Justice Department release Friday \"affirms our grave concern that among the documents stored at Mar-a-Lago were those that could endanger human sources. It is critical that the IC move swiftly to assess and, if necessary, to mitigate the damage done.\" The search was part of a federal investigation into whether Trump illegally removed and kept documents when he left office in January 2021 after losing the 2020 election to President Joe Biden and whether Trump tried to obstruct the probe. Trump, a Republican who is considering another presidential run in 2024, has described the court-approved search at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach as politically motivated, and on Friday again described it as a \"break-in.\""},

Axios first reported the Google statement. The restriction means that Android users, who make up 44% of smartphone users in the U.S., can't download the app. Google will not let the app go live until the content issues are addressed. Truth Social acknowledged Google's concerns and said it would work on addressing these issues, according to Axios. Trump Media and Technology Group CEO Devin Nunes told a different story. The former lawmaker, who was one of former President Donald Trump's staunchest allies in Congress, said the decision is up to Google and not dependent on Truth Social's policies. \"When are we going to be available on Android? Well, look, that's up to the Google Play store. We're waiting on them to approve us, I don't know what's taking so long,\" Nunes said on the \"Just the News Not Noise\" podcast. \"It sure would be nice if they would approve us.\" Google said that Nunes' statements misrepresent the ongoing dialogue between Trump Media and the Play store. Google reiterated that Truth Social's violations, and the steps to redress them, have been clearly communicated with the company. Trump Media pushed back, saying Truth Social was creating a \"vibrant, family-friendly environment.\" \"TMTG has no desire to litigate its business matters in the public sphere, but for the record, has promptly responded to all inquiries from Google,\" the company said in a press release Tuesday. \"It is our belief that all Americans should have access to Truth Social no matter what devices they use. We look forward to Google approving Truth Social at their earliest convenience.\" Trump Media and Technology Group made the app available for preorder on Android in early August. It is available on Apple's App Store. Google's YouTube has suspended Trump's channel. Android users can still access Truth Social through the platform's website. The restriction is one of several obstacles faced by the former president's app. Truth Social was created as a \"free-speech\" alternative to Twitter, after Trump was banned from the platform for his tweets relating to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Hundreds of the president's supporters stormed the building that day to try to block Congress from confirming Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election. Trump, who had about 88 million followers on Twitter, has about 4 million followers on Truth Social, where he continues to push false claims about the election. He is facing a criminal investigation over secret government records he took with him to his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida and is considering another run for the White House. Trump Media was set to go public through a merger with Digital World Acquisition Corporation, a special-purpose acquisition company. The deadline is Sept. 8, although DWAC is pushing for a delay of up to a year. DWAC warned shareholders that a decline in the former president's popularity could hurt the app and that, without a delay, the acquisition company may have to liquidate. DWAC scheduled a shareholder meeting for Sept. 6, two days before the current merger deadline. Shares of the company were down more than 2% Tuesday at $24.65, far from their peak of about $97 in March."},

Twitter shares were down more than 1% in premarket trade. The latest filings come after Twitter's former head of security, Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, earlier this month alleged\"extreme, egregious deficiencies\" by the social media company related to privacy, security and content moderation. On July 8, Musk 's legal team initially filed a notice with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to terminate the Twitter acquisition. Musk's team alleged that \"Twitter has not complied with its contractual obligations.\" The follow-up notice, disclosed to the SEC, cites allegations made by Zatko as additional reasons to terminate the deal. \"Allegations regarding certain facts, known to Twitter prior to and as of July 8, 2022, but undisclosed to the Musk Parties prior to and at that time, have since come to light that provide additional and distinct bases to terminate the Merger Agreement,\" Mike Ringler, Musk's legal representative from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, wrote in a letter to Twitter's legal chief, Vijaya Gadde. Ringler said in the letter that the latest termination notice is \"not legally necessary\" to end the merger deal, but is being delivered in case the July 8 filing is \"determined to be invalid for any reason.\" The letter on behalf of Musk said the Zatko complaint \"alleges far-reaching misconduct at Twitter\u2014all of which was disclosed to Twitter's directors and senior executives, including (CEO) Parag Agrawal\u2014that is likely to have severe consequences for Twitter's business.\" Musk's lawyer said Zatko alleges that Twitter is in \"material noncompliance\" with its obligations under its 2011 agreement with the Federal Trade Commission. The letter laid out some of Zatko's other allegations including claims that Twitter is \"uniquely vulnerable to systemic disruption resulting from data center failures or malicious actors,\" something senior management knew about but \"ignored and sought to obfuscate.\" \"These allegations, if true, demonstrate that Twitter has breached the following provisions of the Merger Agreement, thereby giving the Musk Parties the right to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms,\" the letter said. Twitter's legal team responded on Tuesday by sending a letter to Musk's legal representatives. Twitter said Musk's termination case is \"invalid and wrongful under\" the acquisition agreement. \"It is based solely on statements made by a third party that, as Twitter has previously stated, are riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lack important context,\" the letter written by William Savitt of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz law firm said. \"Contrary to the assertions in your letter, Twitter has breached none of its representations or obligations under the Agreement, and Twitter has not suffered and is not likely to suffer a Company Material Adverse Effect.\" Twitter said it intends to enforce the acquisition agreement and \"close the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon\" with Musk. Twitter's legal team said Musk's latest notice to terminate the deal is \"invalid for the independent reason that Mr. Musk and the other Musk Parties continue to knowingly, intentionally, willfully, and materially breach\" the acquisition agreement. The social media giant has previously responded to Zatko. In a memo to staff posted to Twitter on Aug. 23 by CNN correspondent Donie O'Sullivan, Agrawal described Zatko as \"a former Twitter executive who was terminated in January 2022 for ineffective leadership and poor performance.\" Zatko's attorneys issued a statement on Monday in response to that characterization, saying he \"put his career on the line because of his concerns about Twitter users, the public, and the company's shareholders.\" Twitter and Musk will go on trial on Oct. 17 in Delaware to resolve Musk's attempt to cancel his acquisition of the company unless they reach a settlement first. Since proposing the Twitter takeover, Musk has complained that the number of fake or spam accounts on the social media platform is higher than is being disclosed. In the July 8 letter, Musk's legal team claimed the company had \"failed or refused to provide\" information on these accounts to the Tesla CEO. Ahead of the October trial, Musk's legal team has subpoenaed Zatko, seeking information on the company's spam accounts and its alleged security vulnerabilities. \u2014 CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report."},

In the forthcoming book, \"Like, Comment, Subscribe: Inside YouTube\u2019s Chaotic Rise to World Domination,\" author Mark Bergen writes that the executive, known for being loyal to Google cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, talked about becoming Tesla's Chief Operating Officer before becoming YouTube CEO in 2014. At the time, Wojcicki had been senior vice president of ads and commerce at Google and had been looking for a higher-level role, the book said, citing those close to her. \u201cBy then, Page had begun plotting his own exit \u2014 a plan to hand Google off to a trusted deputy, Sundar Pichai,\" Bergen reports. In a conversation, Laszlo Bock, Google's HR chief at the time, said he \"suggested Page could more easily clear the way for his chosen successor by moving Wojcicki to YouTube.\u201d The announcement of Wojcicki's appointment came as a shock to many Googlers, the book says. Wojcicki had one of the earliest connections to Google -- in 1998, she famously let Page and Brin, who still hold majority shareholder voting power of Google parent company Alphabet, work from her garage when they were starting the company. Her sister, 23andMe founder Anne Wojcicki was married and had kids with Brin. In the book, Bock compared Google to a family enterprise, and the book says Wojcicki often was able to get Page's attention. \u201cWhen people couldn\u2019t get him to see reason, she always could,\u201d said former Google director and early Silicon Valley workplace influencer Kim Scott, who referred to her in the book as \u201ca Larry whisperer.\u201d One example is how Google used search data. \"Wojcicki wanted to use search queries to inform ads people saw on all those banner ads Google ran across the web; if advertisers could target consumers based on searches and on websites, they might spend gobs more with Google,\" the book says. Page had long wanted to keep search data from everything else but Wojcicki \"felt this wasn\u2019t keeping up with trends in the ad industry, which sought ever more data.\u201d \u201cThe founders trust Susan maybe more than anybody on the planet,\" Patrick Keane, an early Google sales director, said in the book. \u201cYou could never get Susan rattled, no matter how challenging the moment was.\u201d YouTube was also discussed as a potential spinout, the book reports. The year after Wojcicki\u2019s appointment, in 2015, Larry Page, announced the creation of Alphabet, a new holding company, that would separate several businesses, including self-driving car Waymo and health sciences unit Verily, from Google. \u201cYouTube seemed like a natural splinter; it already operated with a different name and office,\" the book states. \"Leaders there considered plans to become a separate Alphabet unit, detached from Google. Wojcicki wanted to keep reporting to Page, who had appointed himself Alphabet CEO, rather than his successor at Google, Sundar Pichai. But ultimately it was decided YouTube was too intertwined with Google\u2019s business and machinery to leave. So it stayed at Google.\" Under Wojcicki's watch, YouTube grew to reach more than 81% of U.S. adults and generate nearly $29 billion in revenue in 2021."},

The agency claims Kochava violated a section of the FTC Act that prohibits unfair deceptive practices in commerce. Using data Kochava collected on mobile devices and combining it with public map programs, the FTC found it was possible to infer the identity of the device owner by linking those devices to sensitive locations and tracing them back to single-family homes. The agency claimed that until at least June of this year, Kochava would grant users access to a sample data set of time-stamped location information from 61 million unique mobile devices, with relatively little effort required by the user seeking access to the data. The FTC claims Kochava was aware of this potential use, marketing its services on the Amazon Web Services Marketplace with the suggestion of using its information \"to map individual devices to households.\" The agency argues in its complaint filed in federal court in Idaho that identification via Kochava's location data \"is likely to injure consumers through exposure to stigma, discrimination, physical violence, emotional distress, and other harms.\" It added that Kochava could have installed reasonable safeguards to protect consumer information, like by blacklisting information associated with sensitive locations so that it would not appear in data sets, such as addiction recovery centers, shelters or medical facilities. \"This lawsuit shows the unfortunate reality that the FTC has a fundamental misunderstanding of Kochava's data marketplace business and other data businesses,\" Kochava Collective General Manager Brian Cox said in a statement. \"Kochava operates consistently and proactively in compliance with all rules and laws, including those specific to privacy.\" Cox said the company announced a new ability to block location data from sensitive locations prior to the FTC's lawsuit. He said the company engaged with the FTC for weeks explaining the data collection process and hoped to come up with \"effective solutions\" with the agency. \"Unfortunately the only outcome the FTC desired was a settlement that had no clear terms or resolutions and redefined the problem into a moving target,\" Cox said. \"Real progress to improve data privacy for consumers will not be reached through flamboyant press releases and frivolous litigation. It's disappointing that the agency continues to circumvent the lawmaking process and perpetuate misinformation surrounding data privacy.\" The FTC voted 4-1 to bring the lawsuit, with Republican Commissioner Noah Joshua Phillips voting against filing the complaint. The commission's other Republican, Christine Wilson, voted with the Democratic majority. The lawsuit builds on the agency's focus on privacy, after announcing earlier this month it is exploring new rules to crack down on commercial surveillance and lax data security.

In a series of letters sent Tuesday morning, the committee asked four agencies, including the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Trade Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as five digital asset exchanges \u2014 Coinbase, FTX, Binance.US, Kraken, and KuCoin \u2014 for information and documents about what they are doing, if anything, to safeguard consumers against scams and combat cryptocurrency-related fraud. More than $1 billion in crypto has been lost to fraud since the start of 2021, according to research from the FTC. \"As stories of skyrocketing prices and overnight riches have attracted both professional and amateur investors to cryptocurrencies, scammers have cashed in,\" wrote Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D.-Ill., Chair of the Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy. \"The lack of a central authority to flag suspicious transactions in many situations, the irreversibility of transactions, and the limited understanding many consumers and investors have of the underlying technology make cryptocurrency a preferred transaction method for scammers.\" The letters ask that the federal agencies and crypto exchanges respond by Sept. 12 with information about what they are doing to protect consumers. The committee says that these responses could be used to craft legislative solutions. In particular, the letters ask that the exchanges produce documents dating back through Jan. 1, 2009, which display efforts to combat crypto scams and fraud, as well as show attempts made to \"identify, investigate, and remove or flag potentially fraudulent digital assets or accounts,\" as well as highlight discussions around \"whether to adopt more stringent policies.\" In one letter, addressed to Sam Bankman-Fried, the CEO and founder of FTX, the committee notes that \"while some exchanges review cryptocurrencies before listing them, others allow digital assets to be listed with little or no vetting.\" Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis found that 37% of crypto scam revenue last year went to \"rug pulls,\" a type of scheme that involves developers listing a token on an exchange, pumping it up, and then vanishing with the funds. Binance.US, which also received an inquiry from the committee on Tuesday, has been accused in a class action lawsuit of misleading consumers about the safety of investing in the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin known as terraUSD (or UST, for short) and its sister token, luna. At their height, luna and UST had a combined market value of almost $60 billion. Now, they're essentially worthless. Concern over the safety of crypto funds parked on centralized platforms has also been gaining traction following the recent collapse of Voyager Digital and Celsius, both popular apps among retail traders because of the double-digit annual percentage yield once offered by the two companies. The subsequent bankruptcies of these two platforms have highlighted the question of who owns cryptocurrency assets when a custodial business goes belly up. In the bankruptcy proceedings of both Voyager and Celsius, customers are considered unsecured creditors, rather than federally-insured bank depositors, meaning there is no guarantee they will get any of their money back. As for the relationship between investor and crypto exchange, the terms and conditions vary. In a financial filing released in May, Coinbase said its users would be treated as \"general unsecured creditors\" in the event of bankruptcy. Krishnamoorthi also noted that the agencies often seem to be acting at cross-purposes and giving inconsistent guidance to private-sector players. \"Without clear definitions and guidance, agencies will continue their infighting and will be unable effectively to implement consumer and investor protections related to cryptocurrencies and the exchanges on which they are traded.\""},

The social media companies blamed some of their problems on businesses cutting back on digital advertising because of the weak economy.

First Solar also said Tuesday that it will spend $185 million upgrading and expanding its existing facilities in Ohio. CEO Mark Widmar pointed to the IRA as the key catalyst that made the company decide to build another factory in the U.S. rather than looking elsewhere. The funding packages create, for the first time, a \"long-term view and understanding of the industry, and policies aligned to that industry,\" he told CNBC. \"With that level of clarity, we stepped back and evaluated the alternatives or the options of where we could go with our next factory and when we looked at it comprehensively the U.S. was a very attractive option,\" he said. Widmar added that this is the first time the entire supply chain has been incentivized, from the manufacturer to the generating asset and finally to the end customer. \"With that type of alignment, you can create partnerships and opportunities to grow together collectively and more of a win-win type of structure than maybe we had before the implementation of the IRA,\" he said. First Solar said the new factory will manufacture 3.5 gigawatts of solar modules annually by 2025, with the company's Ohio facilities posting cumulative annual production capacity of over 7 GW by 2025. By comparison, the U.S. added 3.9 GW of solar capacity during the first quarter of 2022, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. The country's total solar industry now stands at 126.1 GW, which is enough to power 22 million homes, according to SEIA. Shares of First Solar have surged 65% since the end of July when Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V. announced their surprise agreement on the climate, health care and tax bill. The legislation, which swiftly passed the House and Senate and was signed into law by President Joe Biden, benefits First Solar in several ways, including through the production tax credit for domestic manufacturers. First Solar is the largest U.S.-based developer of solar panels, with a focus on utility-scale panels. The factory announcement comes as First Solar struggles to keep pace with booming demand. During its second quarter earnings call, First Solar said it's sold out through 2025, with a backlog of 44 GW. Widmar said First Solar wants to move quickly when building out its new factory. One of the company's considerations is a site that's as close to shovel-ready as possible. Other factors include the type and availability of workers in the area. First Solar is aiming to have identified the site by the end of the current quarter. \"I think the industry is in the best position it ever has been\u2026for growth beyond any expectations that anyone would have envisioned,\" Widmar said."},

The lawsuit also names MicroStrategy as a defendant. Racine alleges the company conspired to help Saylor evade the taxes. The AG's office said it's seeking to recover a total sum of over $100 million in unpaid taxes and penalties. Shares of MicroStrategy were down more than 6% Wednesday afternoon on the news. Saylor, who oversaw the company's push into bitcoin, stepped down as CEO earlier this month. Under his leadership, MicroStrategy spent close to $4 billion acquiring bitcoin at an average price of $30,700, and he has said he considers the company's stock a sort of bitcoin ETF. Saylor allegedly claimed to reside in Virginia or Florida, which have lower or no personal income tax rates, while actually living in several different homes around D.C., including a penthouse apartment in the Georgetown neighborhood or on his yacht on the Georgetown waterfront or Potomac River when the apartment was undergoing renovations, according to the lawsuit. The suit includes several screenshots of posts that appear to be from Saylor's Facebook page dating back several years and referencing the view from his \"Georgetown balcony\" and discussing his \"home\" while tagging Washington, D.C. MicroStrategy allegedly \"had detailed information confirming that Saylor was in fact a DC resident,\" according to a press release, but it chose to withhold that information. In a statement, MicroStrategy said, \"The case is a personal tax matter involving Mr. Saylor. The Company was not responsible for his day-to-day affairs and did not oversee his individual tax responsibilities. Nor did the Company conspire with Mr. Saylor in the discharge of his personal tax responsibilities. The District of Columbia's claims against the Company are false and we will defend aggressively against this overreach.\" Around 2014, the AG's office claims in the lawsuit, MicroStrategy's then-chief financial officer confronted Saylor about his alleged tax evasion being a potential liability for the company. Saylor and MicroStrategy ended up reaching an agreement where Saylor's salary would be reduced to a nominal $1, the lawsuit claims, in order to reduce the risk authorities would discover the alleged scheme. Still, the AG alleges, Saylor continued to benefit from \"fringe benefits\" with a \"high cash value,\" such as use of the company plane. \"A decade ago, I bought an historic house in Miami Beach and moved my home there from Virginia,\" Saylor said in a statement. \"Although MicroStrategy is based in Virginia, Florida is where I live, vote, and have reported for jury duty, and it is at the center of my personal and family life. I respectfully disagree with the position of the District of Columbia, and look forward to a fair resolution in the courts.\" The suit is the first to be brought under a recently passed law called the False Claims Act, according to Racine's office. The district law incentivizes whistleblowers to report tax fraud and allows the court to impose penalties up to three times the amount of the evaded taxes, according to the AG's office. The district suit follows a separate complaint filed by whistleblowers against Saylor in April 2021, accusing him of failing to pay income taxes from 2014 through 2020. The complaint was filed under seal but made public on Wednesday. The AG's office said it independently investigated the whistleblower case and found MicroStrategy had filed inaccurate W-2s with his Florida-based address and had failed to withhold taxes allegedly owed to the district. The new lawsuit alleges Saylor failed to pay income tax he owed to the district starting in 2005. \u2014 MacKenzie Sigalos contributed to this story.

The Swedish payments firm generated revenues of 9.1 billion Swedish krona ($950 million) in the period spanning January to the end of June 2022. That was up 24% from a year ago. But the company also racked up hefty losses. Klarna's pre-tax loss soared more than threefold year-on-year to nearly 6.2 billion krona. In the first half of 2021, Klarna lost around 1.8 billion Swedish krona. The company, which allows users to spread the cost of purchases over interest-free installments, saw a jump in operating expenses and defaults. Operating expenses before credit losses came in at 10.8 billion Swedish krona, up from 6.3 billion krona year-over-year, driven by administrative costs related to its rapid international expansion in countries like the U.S. Credit losses, meanwhile, rose more than 50% to 2.9 billion Swedish krona. Klarna had previously been profitable for most of its existence \u2014 that is up until 2019, when the firm dipped into the red for the first time after a hike in investments aimed at growing the business globally. The company's ballooning losses highlight the price of its rapid expansion after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Klarna has entered 11 new markets since the start of 2020, and took a number of costly gambits to extend its foothold in the U.S. and Britain. In the U.S., Klarna has spent heavily on marketing and user acquisition in an effort to chip away at Affirm, its main rival stateside. In the U.K., meanwhile, the firm acquired PriceRunner, a price comparison site, in April. It has also engaged in a charm offensive with British politicians and regulators ahead of incoming regulations. More recently, Klarna has been forced to cut back. In May, the company slashed about 10% of its global workforce in a swift round of job cuts. The company subsequently raised raised funds at a $6.7 billion valuation \u2014 an 85% drop from its previous valuation \u2014 in an $800 million investment deal that defined the capitulation from high-growth tech firms as investors grew wary of a possible recession. The sharp discount reflected grim sentiment among investors in fintech in both the public and private markets, with publicly-listed fintech Affirm having lost about three quarters of its market value since the start of 2022. \"We've had to make some tough decisions, ensuring we have the right people, in the right place, focused on business priorities that will accelerate us back to profitability while supporting consumers and retailers through a more difficult economic period,\" said Sebastian Siemiatkowski, CEO and co-founder of Klarna. \"We needed to take immediate and pre-emptive action, which I think was misunderstood at the time, but now sadly we have seen many other companies follow suit.\" Klarna said it plans to tighten its approach to lending, particularly with new customers, to factor in the worsening cost-of-living situation. However, Siemiatkowski said, \"You won't see the impact of this on our financials in this report yet.\" \"We have a very agile balance sheet, especially in comparison to traditional banks due to the short-term nature of our products, but even for Klarna it takes a little while for the impact of decisions to flow through.\" Fintech companies are cutting expenses and delaying listing plans amid a worsening macroeconomic backdrop. Meanwhile, consumer-oriented services are losing their appeal among investors while so-called \"business-to-business\" fintechs attract the limelight. Klarna says it is now used by over 150 million people, while the company counts 450,000 merchants on its network. Klarna mainly generates income from retailers, not users, taking a small slice of each transaction processed through its platform. \"Ultimately they've proven there can be a profitable business there but have doubled down on growing in the U.S. market which is expensive,\" Simon Taylor, head of strategy at fintech startup Sardine.ai, told CNBC. \"Market share there will be meaningful for long-term revenue. But it takes time and the funding taps aren't what they used to be.\" But the company faces stiff competition, with titans in the realms of both tech and finance seeking to capitalize on growth in the buy now, pay later industry. Apple is set to launch its own BNPL product, Apple Pay Later, this fall, which will allow users to split the cost of their purchases over four equal monthly payments. Meanwhile, proposals are afoot to bring the BNPL market under regulatory supervision. In the U.K., the government has announced plans to enforce tighter affordability checks and a crackdown on misleading advertisements. Stateside, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau opened a market-monitoring probe into BNPL companies."},

Speaking to CNBC's \" Street Signs Asia\" on Wednesday, Sanjay Kapoor, who is now an independent analyst, said Indian mobile operator Reliance Jio's $25 billion plan to launch 5G network across the country indicates that India is \"very serious\" about 5G. 5G refers to the fifth generation of high-speed mobile internet which offers super-fast download speeds and more bandwidth that's capable of supporting technologies like driverless cars and virtual reality applications, including the metaverse. According to Reuters, Reliance is making a push to roll out its network within two months. It is also developing an affordable 5G smartphone with Google, according to the report. \"But when you look at what's happening \u2026 [in] China, for example, a single operator puts in more than $15 [billion], $16 billion every year, and they've been doing it for the last couple of years,\" said Kapoor. \"From an international perspective, [$25 billion] seems pretty okay. But in India, it looks really colossal.\" In July, India kicked off its 5G auction ahead of a planned 2023 rollout. Bidders include three of the country's major mobile operators in India \u2014 Reliance Jio, the market leader, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea \u2014 as well as Indian billionaire Gautam Adani's Adani Enterprises. Kapoor said the battle for the 72 gigahertz of 5G spectrum will be a \"two-horse race\" between Reliance and Bharti Airtel. \"They will be neck-to-neck [and] the strategies might differ,\" he added. Reliance Industries' Jio deposited 140 billion rupees of earnest money with the Indian government in July \u2014 it was the largest sum among the contenders. The amount of earnest money deposited is an indication of the amount of spectrum a company wishes to buy. Bharti Airtel deposited 55 billion rupees, while Vodafone Idea put in an earnest money deposit of 22 billion rupees. Reliance may have had a first-mover's advantage with its recent announcement, but Bharti Airtel's postpaid customer base could give it an edge over its rival, Kapoor said. However, what customers really value is their experience with a service provider, he pointed out. \"Therefore, each one of them will have to strive for supremacy in the market to make sure that they have a positive customer experience and are able to be competitive and world-class.\" But India's 5G infrastructure still has some way to go before that can happen, according to Kapoor. \"To give a sizable rollout in a country as large as India, it's not going to be very easy,\" he said. \"Do we have completely fiberized sites? China, for example, has a million sites already \u2026 and we [have] roughly, to each operator, about 250,000 sites.\" He added that India is going to need \"a lot more\" fiberized sites before it can give coverage to every nook and corner. Fibre infrastructure is the backbone of ultra-fast 5G networks, where a large availability of fiber-optic cables are required. \"To the time when we really can boast about giving a great customer experience, I think we are two, three years away,\" Kapoor said."},

In a filing with the SEC, Nvidia said the U.S. government told the company on Aug. 26, about a new license requirement for future exports to China, including Hong Kong, to reduce the risk that the products may be used by the Chinese military. Nvidia said the restriction would affect the A100 and H100 products, which are graphics processing units sold to businesses. \"The license requirement also includes any future Nvidia integrated circuit achieving both peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance equal to or greater than thresholds that are roughly equivalent to the A100, as well as any system that includes those circuits,\" the filing said. The company expects that it could lose $400 million in potential sales in China in the current quarter after previously forecasting revenue of $5.9 billion. The new rule also applies to sales to Russia, but Nvidia said it doesn't have paying customers there. In recent years, the U.S. government has applied increasing export restrictions to chips made with U.S. technology because of fears that Chinese companies could use them for military purposes or steal trade secrets. Nvidia said it was applying for a license to continue some Chinese exports but doesn't know whether the U.S. government will grant an exemption. \"We are working with our customers in China to satisfy their planned or future purchases with alternative products and may seek licenses where replacements aren't sufficient,\" an Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC. \"The only current products that the new licensing requirement applies to are A100, H100 and systems such as DGX that include them.\" An AMD representative confirmed to CNBC that it had also received new licensing requirements from the U.S. Department of Commerce which it believed applied to its MI250 circuit, which is intended for artificial intellegence. AMD said it did not believe the new requirements would cause a material impact to its business.

CEO Evan Spiegel announced the moves in a memo Tuesday, and told employees the company needs to restructure its business to deal with its financial challenges. He said the company's current year-over-year revenue growth rate for the quarter of 8% \"is well below what we were expecting earlier this year.\" \"While we have built substantial capital reserves, and have made extensive efforts to avoid reductions in the size of our team by reducing spend in other areas, we must now face the consequences of our lower revenue growth and adapt to the market environment,\" Spiegel said. \"We are restructuring our business to increase focus on our three strategic priorities: community growth, revenue growth, and augmented reality.\" Other projects the company nuked include its Snap Minis third-party apps and Snap Games. Spiegel said Snap is also starting the \"process of winding down\" its Zenly map product and Voisey music feature, which were both inherited through acquisitions. Snap has also promoted Jerry Hunter from senior vice president of engineering to chief operating officer. Hunter will continue leading Snap's engineering unit, Spiegel said. The company said it hired Ronan Harris, Google's vice president and managing director of U.K. and Ireland, to be its president of the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, a new position. Harris will join Snap's executive team. Spiegel said Snap is currently searching for presidents of the company's Asia-Pacific and Americas regions, also two new roles. \"Changes of this magnitude are never easy, and we must act decisively to meet this moment as a team,\" Spiegel said. \"I am proud of the strength and resilience of our team as we have navigated the myriad challenges of growing our business in a highly competitive industry during uncertain and unprecedented times.\" In July, Snap shares cratered more than 25% after the company reported second-quarter results that missed on both the top and bottom lines and said it would not provide guidance for its current quarter. The company said at the time that it planned to \"substantially\" slow its hiring rate and operating expense growth rate. Like other social media companies, including Facebook parent Meta, Pinterest and Twitter, Snap said a confluence of factors has simultaneously hurt the company's business. They include a weakening macroeconomic environment and Apple 's 2021 iOS update, which made it more difficult for social media companies to track users on behalf of third-party advertisers. The rise of TikTok's short-video service has also posed a significant challenge for Snap and its competitors. Snap said it was scrapping development of its Pixy drone after reports surfaced that the company was pausing its work on the device. The drone was supposed to be a fun way for users to take photos of themselves from multiple angles. Snap has been trying to build a consumer hardware business and announced the $230 drone in April."},

It's also working with dairy farmers to help them reduce emissions produced on their farms. While electricity and transportation tend to get most of the attention when it comes to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, agriculture is a massive contributor. Breakthrough Energy Ventures has segmented global emissions into five categories, and agriculture is the third worst offender, responsible for 19% of total greenhouse gas emissions, behind manufacturing (31%) and electricity (27%), but ahead of transportation (16%) and buildings (7%). Neutral Foods milk is in about 2,000 grocery stores and has already received funding from a diverse roster of celebrity investors, including Mark Cuban, NBA stars LeBron James and Kevin Love, Tobias Harris, and musicians John Legend and Questlove. The company is planning to expand into butter, and eventually meat. \"It's clear that consumers are hungry for sustainable, climate-forward options and they're reflecting that in their purchasing decisions, especially when it comes to buying food and beverages,\" Carmichael Roberts, one half of the investing committee at Bill Gates' investment fund, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, told CNBC. Neutral Foods measures the carbon emissions of the entire lifecycle of its products and purchases carbon offsets for the measured emissions, Ann Radil, the Head of Carbon Reduction at Neutral Foods, told CNBC. Carbon credits are permits that businesses buy to certify greenhouse gasses have been removed from the atmosphere. While not all carbon credits are reliably policed, Neutral Foods says it uses only offsets verified by Climate Action Reserve (CAR), which it says are quite strict. CAR offsets are \"real, additional, permanent, verifiable, and enforceable,\" said Lauren Brown, senior manager of carbon reduction data and analytics for Neutral Foods. Long-term, the company's plan is to work with farms to reduce their greenhouse emissions directly. Currently, Neutral Foods has eight distinct projects underway at farms it works with and 30 projects in some phase of development, Radil told CNBC. Those projects include changing what cows eat and changing how cow manure is managed. Separating and composting manure \"alone can reduce manure-related GHG emissions like methane and nitrous oxide by 19 to 50 percent,\" Radil told CNBC. Also, Neutral Foods is working with farms to change the way they plant things on the farm to improve the amount of carbon that gets absorbed by the soil. The start-up both guides farmers to help them make changes in the operations on their farms to reduce emissions and then also provides the financing to make those changes, explains CEO Marcus Lovell Smith. Helping farmers lower the emissions on their farms requires approaching farmers with respect. \"You don't go onto a farm and tell a farmer what to do,\" said Smith, who runs his own dairy farm in New Hampshire. \"Farmers are one of the most independent minded groups of people in the country. So I learned that pretty quickly.\" One partner is Groeneveld Farms, a dairy farm with 240 cows, located in Snohomish County, Washington. The farm grows 90% of its feed, and Neutral Foods has helped it figure out how to plant two different crops -- corn and grass -- at the same time.This process, sometimes known as \"co-cropping\" or \"relay cropping\" means the farm only has to till the ground once, which decreases the amount of fossil fuels used on the farm. \"We can do this in a way that works really well for where we are located here in Washington,\" Groeneveld told CNBC. \"Neutral found this appealing and it's something that works within both of our collective budgets to try out.\" Neutral Foods started its product line with milk, which it currently sells at Amazon -owned Whole Foods, Target stores on the West Coast, Sprouts, and various other grocers. The price of Neutral Foods is \"pretty much in the middle of the pack for organic milk,\" CEO Smith said. Results so far are positive. \"We are pleased with how customers are reacting and purchasing the Neutral Foods products. Based on that, we are looking at other opportunities to expand with them into other items,\" said Sprouts spokesperson Steve Nieto. Starting in August, Neutral Foods will start selling carbon neutral pasture-raised butter, and it's planning to expand its product repertoire to include beef as well. Carman Ranch, located in the Wallowa Valley in northeast Oregon, raises cows and hogs. Owner Cory Carman, reached out to Neutral Foods to see they were working on any carbon emissions tracking programs for beef. \"We know that there are so many innovations in agriculture that can make a huge difference in greenhouse gas emissions or carbon sequestration, but discovering how those innovations play out in specific regions, or testing new ones is incredibly hard for individual ranchers,\" Carman told CNBC. Carman Ranch is what is called a \"century farm\" because the same family has worked the farm for over a hundred years. Cory herself grew up on the ranch and has worked at the ranch for the last two decades. \"Neutral has helped bring us technology, resources, and information that I would never had access to and that I am now sharing across my network.\" Carman Ranch has learned about feed supplements for cattle that lower the methane that cows belch out when they digest their food, Carman told CNBC. Currently, Carman Ranch is running trials with Neutral Foods to plant feed for their cows to graze on that contain condensed tannins. \"They are nutritious to our animals, promote soil health and can lower methane emissions,\" Carman told CNBC. Carman Ranch is also running a trial with Neutral Foods to put a seaweed supplement into the feed for 50 cattle. For this pilot program, Neutral Foods and the company making the seaweed supplement, Symbrosia, \"will bring leading researchers, partners, equipment, and procedures to measure methane emissions and weight gain, conduct a full life cycle analysis, and generate verified carbon credits,\" Carman said. It will take time for the projects Neutral Foods is doing with farms to be fully implemented and measurably reduce the emissions of their products, Radil told CNBC. But for now, Gates' investment fund is encouraged by the steps Neutral Foods is making. \"It sends a critical price signal to farmers that climate-forward practices have value. As they continue to improve upon those decarbonization techniques, there's an opportunity for scale at the farm level that can mirror the brand's growth and retail expansion,\" Roberts told CNBC. Fellow investor Marc Cuban, who put money into the company last October, agrees. \"I think consumers are becoming increasingly concerned about the impact of the products they consume on the environment,\" Cuban told CNBC. \"I think Neutral is well positioned to meet that demand.\""},

While there may be limited options to hedge inflation in a 401(k) plan, investors may have more choices in other accounts, said certified financial planner Bill Brancaccio, co-owner of Rightirement Wealth Partners in Harrison, New York. His firm began shifting client portfolios last summer, expecting higher inflation with the possibility of rising interest rates. \"You have to make changes before the train leaves the station,\" he said. A \"broad basket of commodities,\" including energy, materials and metals, typically 3% to 10% of the overall portfolio, has been a good addition, he said. \"If we're going to have persistent inflation, commodities are a really good hedge against that,\" he added, noting the assets may also perform well as interest rates rise. While many advisors built portfolios to withstand volatility, do-it-yourself investors may still have room for improvement, said CFP Anthony Watson, founder and president of Thrive Retirement Specialists in Dearborn, Michigan. For example, you'll want to consider your bonds' so-called duration, which measures sensitivity to interest rate changes. Expressed in years, duration factors in the coupon, time to maturity and yield paid through the term. \"You want to make sure that your bonds are lower in duration,\" because when interest rates are rising, you can reinvest the proceeds sooner to earn more, Watson said. And you'll want to make sure there's \"high-quality bond exposure,\" including so-called investment-grade bonds, he said, which are generally lower risk because the issuer is less likely to default. While market interest rates and bond prices move in opposite directions \u2014 higher rates make values fall \u2014 these assets still play a key role to diversify the portfolio during prolonged downturns, Brancaccio said."},

One of the enduring lessons of the iPhone era is that Steve Jobs led with what the consumer didn't know they wanted until he showed it to them. Robotics pioneer Rodney Brooks has operated from a similar idea \u2014 with varying degrees of success. His robot vacuum cleaner Roomba, and its parent company iRobot, which more or less made the category of robotic vacuums an inexpensive, must-have for many consumers, was recently sold to Amazon for $1.7 billion. \"iRobot found a product-market fit. It had a feature set and a cost that lots and lots of people were willing to pay for, that puck-shaped thing that cleans the floor pretty well,\" said Matt Beane, an assistant professor in the technology management program at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and a robotics expert. But another of Brooks' big, early ideas, hasn't worked out the way he or the world imagined. Rethink Robotics was founded in 2008 with the idea that a cobot \u2014 a robot working alongside humans in ways that traditional automation couldn't (i.e. with much less danger to the human), and without the fencing that most industrial robots remained inside \u2014 was a market waiting to be made among industrial customers. But for all the novel ideas that Brooks and his Rethink colleagues brought to the table, its first cobot never caught on. It caught on in the press, for sure, and if you were following tech news at the beginning of the last decade you likely saw Baxter and \"his eyes\" staring out from the screen between his arms at some point in a photo or video footage. At CNBC, we learned firsthand the limitations of working with novel industrial robots when we invited Baxter on-air for a live segment as part of Rethink being named to the inaugural Disruptor 50 list in 2013. For technical reasons, it would have been a lot more difficult than we imagined to get Baxter onto the television studio set. While he may not be a part of the robotic future anymore, there is no history of the cobot that can be written without Baxter. \"There is no such thing as the cobot without Rod Brooks,\" Beane said. \"Rethink started the industry.\" After a lot of early fanfare, reality set in for Rethink. By 2018, it was struggling to scale its operations and find enough buyers for Baxter, with its two-armed design proving to be a novel idea, but a mistake. \"No one needs a two-armed robot,\" Beane said, describing that design decision as \"humans projecting onto a robot their own physical form.\" Rethink pivoted, in what turned out to be a move made too late, to a one-armed robot named Sawyer. But the technology had other problems. Rethink bet on an approach that used elastic actuators \u2014 a technology one of Brooks co-founders was an expert on \u2014 which allowed the robot to perform \"force sensing,\" an approach the company backed because it would make the robots safer around human coworkers. Rethink's design would also make the robots low cost, getting rid of standard industry reliance on motors and related parts. Paul Maeder, a mechanical engineer who invested early in Rethink through his VC firm, told the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in a post-mortem on Rethink that goes deep into the technical shortcomings, that cheaper parts plus force sensing seemed like the way to bring down pricing in the robotics market and appeal to customers. And it did bring down pricing. \"The reality is that they had a very low price point, shockingly low,\" Beane said. \"They had done an amazingly good job at materials sourcing and design, and they were headed to one-third or one-quarter of the price for other robots.\" But Rethink never achieved the market penetration or scale it needed to maintain its operations. As the financials worsened, Rethink became the acquisition target of a Chinese firm, a deal Beane says would have had a good shot at getting the firm to scale. But that deal was scuttled \"at the last moment,\" according to the company, and a 2018 bankruptcy followed. Rethink was bought out of bankruptcy by German automation company Hahn Group, which is still trying to make the technology a success today. In a statement provided to TechCrunch at the time of its demise, Rethink said, \"We were early to market with a very innovative product that was ahead of its time, and unfortunately, we did not achieve the commercial success we had expected.\" It's true Rethink had no shortage of interesting, innovative ideas, even if they weren't the right ones for the market. According to Beane, one of the most intriguing was the ability for the cobot to be programmed by the worker. \"People don't make much of this feature anymore, but that was a graphic user interface system which didn't require code and you could teach it, train it to do a job as the worker,\" Beane said. \"But no manager would turn those features on,\" he added. That's an idea that Brooks is still working on today, through his latest robotics startup Robust.ai, co-founded with cognitive scientist Gary Marcus, which is making a warehouse cobot, Carter, that is like a mobile shopping cart providing transport within fulfillment centers. \"It can drive in any direction and is worker programmable and can physically collaborate,\" Beane said. \"A lot of the same DNA is there.\" Once Sawyer became the lead cobot, Rethink invested in a technology that integrated the cobot with preexisting industrial automation, an interesting approach, but ultimately, another bottleneck that was costly in engineering time to connect and to get to communicate with machinery like conveyors. \"Just to alter the speed of a conveyor is extremely expensive,\" Beane said. The DNA that has become standard in the cobot market that Baxter, and later Sawyer, hoped to dominate, is from Rethink rival and Denmark-based Universal Robots. While its cobots may be \"very boring looking\" in Beane's view, they were what the market ultimately wanted. \"In the end, the series elastic actuators were probably not the best idea in the world,\" Maeder told ASME. \"What customers really want is a low-cost, simple, fast, repeatable robot. They want to put something in this exact location again, and again and again. In the end, that was a lot more complicated for us to achieve than for some of our competitors because they weren't trying to do force sensing.\" Even the two arms that Baxter had could always be purchased by a buyer if they really wanted that approach, by purchasing two single-arm robots, and that's what Universal Robots \u2014 which was acquired by industrial automation company Teradyne in 2015 \u2014 excels at, with its UR3, UR5 and UR7 cobots leading to increased sales, and successive generations of its cobot line continuing to hit the market. The opportunity for robotics technology remains significant, though it is still trailing other automation approaches in market penetration. Robot sales in the North American market have been growing, and the Teradyne unit led by Universal Robots is seeing steady, if not explosive, sales growth, too. Revenue was $300 million in 2019, and then increased to $376 million last year after a Covid dip. According to Wall Street estimates, sales could reach $440 million this year, or about 18% growth. That growth rate is higher than the percentage of overall revenue it represents, which is still under 15%. \"A lot more will occur,\" Beane said. \"Progress often looks slow up close ... but the utility of a robotic system that can accomplish general tasks at a reasonable cost is extraordinary, billions, maybe trillions worth of value,\" he added. And costs keep going down, from batteries to sensors and software, meaning the price performance for robots keeps going up steadily. But where the cobot finds its greatest utility remains an open question. While the industrial world use has been in the first decades often as much a marketing ploy or, at best, an experiment rather than proof of widespread adoption, there is reason to forecast multiple roles for cobots based on an aging demographic. \"Anyone who says not in my lifetime, you better hope it is in your lifetime, because you will need help,\" Beane said. He anticipates that jobs outside of the manufacturing sector with which cobots have been associated \u2014 from warehousing to retail, medical (think cobots bringing supplies to nurses) and retirement communities \u2014 are areas poised for growing use. \"Manufacturing is about high throughput and high consistency and you can automate the heck out of it without a cobot,\" Beane said. \"We're only just getting started on this capability being useful and used at scale.\" Rodney Brooks is among the robotics experts who has spoken about a world that is getting older and a working population that is not as strong. He wrote in a blog post covering his annual predictions that \"soon the houses of the elderly will be cluttered with too many robots.\" Wall Street analysts are focused on the opportunity presented by a chronic labor shortage, and related changes taking place in a global outsourcing paradigm which economies including the U.S. have been relying on for decades. With \"near shoring\" and onshoring of more manufacturing activity, there is increasing demand for labor in a tight labor market. One answer is automation, and technology like Universal Robots is relatively easy to program and implement. But one big issue the cobots have not yet solved is the same one that started Brooks down the Rethink path: figuring out what everyone wants from this technology, the \"killer app,\" so to speak, for the cobot. Universal Robots has many different applications for its technology, but not a single one that drives strong demand within one very high volume market. That's a solvable problem, but still a work in progress. Robots running popcorn stations in a movie theatre or robot cafe baristas aren't the career opportunity that takes the cobots to center stage in the economy. But there is a shortage of people and automation has to be one of the solutions, even if it doesn't happen by tomorrow. We have not reached a world of genuine physical collaboration between human worker and cobot, Beane says, \"the kind of stuff where humans reach over to grab the next thing and the robot sees I am reaching and hands it to me and we might even brush up against each other,\" but, \"We are getting there,\" he added. The automated systems that are most widely deployed remain the ones that are more dangerous and kept at a distance. But Beane thinks that Rethink came closer to solving the problem than it is given credit for, and has yet to prove in its new life under Hahn. Hahn did not respond to a request for comment by press time. \"Another eight months and maybe they might have gotten product-market fit. It was inexpensive and reliable. I really do believe we could have seen an iPhone moment,\" Beane said. In his personal blog, Brooks summed up the Rethink story this way: \"Baxter and Sawyer were the first safe robots that did not require a cage to keep humans away from them for the humans' protection. And Sawyer was the first modern industrial robot which finally got away from having a computer-like language to control it, as all robots had since the idea was first developed at the Stanford AI Lab back in the very early seventies. There is still a lot remaining to be done.\""},

Bloomberg, that is. That's what many Americans apparently aspire to today. Some 44% of U.S. adults believe they have the available tools to become billionaires, largely fueled by speculative investments such as cryptocurrencies, according to the Harris Poll's recent Americans and Billionaires Survey. \"It's not just investing in an IRA [individual retirement account],\" said Freddie Rappina, owner of Opta Financial in Tampa, Florida. More from Personal Finance:\nWorkers have the \u2018upper hand\u2019 right now\nTips for paying down your credit card balance\nNearly half of all Americans are falling deeper in debt \"People want to achieve a higher wealth status, and the way to do that is to use investments to build assets and generate income,\" Rappina added. \"Investments don't make you rich; income makes you rich.\" At the same time, most Americans have a love-hate relationship with extreme wealth. \"There is a mounting disconnect,\" the Harris report found: Six in 10 adults want to become a billionaire one day. Meanwhile, 40% said they despise billionaires. Many also said that billionaires have the responsibility to better society but aren't doing enough. As the rich get richer, 66% of adults see wealth inequality as a serious national issue, and nearly half of Americans, or 47%, believe that there should be a limit to wealth accumulation, the report also found. Of those polled, 24% said personal wealth should be capped at less than $1 billion, while 20% said it should be capped somewhere between $1 billion and $10 billion. There are roughly 200 people in the U.S. who are currently worth more than $10 billion, according to Forbes' annual ranking of the richest people. Among the top five, Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates and Elon Musk are all worth more than $100 billion. Meanwhile, extreme wealth inequality was exacerbated by the Covid pandemic, other reports also show. The richest Americans have continued to benefit from owning equities and real estate, particularly last year when both the stock market and home values soared. As of the end of 2021, the top 1% owned a record 32.3% of the nation's wealth. On the flipside, the share of wealth held by the bottom 90% of Americans fell since before the pandemic, to 30.2% from 30.5%. In the Harris poll, 58% of Americans were resentful of wealth accumulation over this period, when others suffered from the financial fallout brought on by the sudden economic downturn. The widening divide between the haves and have-nots highlights the need for more taxes on the wealthiest, according to a report released in May by Oxfam, the global charity focused on eliminating poverty. President Joe Biden has his own plan to make the wealthy pay more as part of his 2023 federal budget. \"Right now, the average billionaire \u2014 there are about 790 of them or so in America \u2014 has a federal tax rate of 8%,\" Biden tweeted. The Billionaire Minimum Income Tax would assess a 20% minimum tax rate on U.S. households worth more than $100 million. Over half the revenue could come from those worth more than $1 billion. But despite growing public support for higher taxes on the ultra-wealthy, billionaire tax proposals have failed to gain traction. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube."},

When the market gets challenging, investors should look to capitalize by building positions \"in companies with exposure to powerful long-term themes, like the rise of LNG,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"I think this will be one of the best stories of the next decade, regardless of what the Fed's doing right now or [Russian president Vladimir Putin] is doing for that matter.\" Cheniere, a pioneer in the LNG industry, is \"on track to make $8.62 per share this year, [with] that number expected to grow to $16 in 2023,\" Cramer said. \"Of course, the stock's had a huge run, up 59% year-to-date, but if you believe Cheniere can hit the estimates, then the stock remains pretty darn cheap, trading at just 10 times next year's numbers. But some of that's because this is temporary and the analysts expect the earnings to pull back to around $12 in following years, although it's still fairly cheap on that number, too.\" Tellurian is \"not expected to begin shipping liquefied natural gas until 2026, but they finally started building their first facility in Louisiana earlier this year,\" Cramer said. \"This makes Tellurian inherently speculative, though, and they'll probably have to do more than one round of fundraising between now and 2026 to keep everything on track,\" Cramer said. However, he added, the longer Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues and disrupts European gas supply, the \"more realistic\" Tellurian's vision becomes. Cramer noted in April he encouraged viewers to wait for a pullback in Tellurian shares. At the time, it traded around $6 per share. Now, it's at $4 per share, and Cramer said he thinks it's worth buying here. He also noted Cheniere co-founder Charif Souki is also co-founder and executive chair of Tellurian. While Cheniere and Tellurian represent more pure-play LNG companies, Sempra Energy is \"more of a diversified utility with a liquefied natural gas export kicker,\" Cramer said. \"We've got Sempra in the bullpen for the Charitable Trust. ... We're just waiting for a pullback to buy this one because they reported a great quarter. This is the right time to own a utility,\" Cramer said. Excelerate Energy went public in mid-April, Cramer noted, calling the company \"the rare recent IPO I can get behind.\" The company \"owns a fleet of ships that work as floating LNG import facilities. If you want to start importing this stuff, Excelerate's the cheapest and fastest way to do it,\" Cramer explained. \"Now, the stock had been on a nice roll, but in recent weeks it's been clobbered, including a nasty 8% decline just yesterday, possibly because European regulators started talking about imposing price controls on natural gas,\" Cramer said. \"Still, Excelerate's started making deals with European countries that desperately need energy. Even before that, they had 223% revenue growth in the second quarter, but now you're basically getting that quarter for free.\" Cramer did caution, however, that Excelerate is slightly more speculative, so it might be better for younger investors who can take on more risk. \"While this company's basically a toll road operator for energy, they've also got a number of irons in the fire for liquefied natural gas,\" Cramer said. Just over a month ago, Enbridge announced a partnership with Pacific Energy to build an LNG export terminal in British Columbia. Plus, their pipeline network transports a great deal of the gas that goes to other people's export terminals. The rise of this sub-sector is terrific for their core business. It may take a long time to kick in, but Enbridge is paying you to wait with that 6.3% yield.\" Sign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market. Disclaimer"},

The retailer is taking a minority stake in Sustainable Beef, which plans to open a processing facility in North Platte, a small town in west-central Nebraska that is home to the former ranch of storied Western showman Buffalo Bill Cody. It expects to break ground next month and create 800 jobs. Walmart declined to disclose the specific amount of its investment. As part of the deal, however, the retailer will get the majority of beef produced at the facility, which is expected to open by late 2024, said Tyler Lehr, senior vice president of merchandising for deli services, meat and seafood for Walmart U.S. It will also get representation on the company's board. For the retailer, the deal means a larger, more consistent supply of beef, including better cuts. For shoppers, it will show up in the form of ground beef and steaks \u2014 including ribeye, sirloin and New York strip \u2014 in its meat department. Walmart will source Angus from the company, a type of beef that comes from a cattle breed often associated with more flavor because of its marbling. The beef will hit store shelves in the central part of the country starting in late 2024, Lehr said. Walmart, the country's largest grocer by revenue, is making investments in agriculture and food production as consumers eat differently and crave more information about the items they toss in their shopping carts. The company invested earlier this year in Plenty, a California-based startup that grows leafy greens indoors and closer to urban centers. The agriculture method of vertical farming uses less water, eliminates the need for pesticides and requires less transportation to get to the store shelf. Two years ago, Walmart opened a beef-processing facility for Angus beef in Thomasville, Ga., and in 2018, it opened a high-tech dairy plant in Fort Wayne, Ind. The Sustainable Beef investment also feeds Walmart's environmental and social commitments. By 2030, the retailer, along with the company's foundation, has pledged to protect, restore or more sustainably manage at least 50 million acres of land and 1 million square miles of ocean by 2030. And two years ago, it said it would work toward sourcing more sustainable fresh beef by working with ranchers on grazing management, grain sourcing and more. Groceries drive almost 60% of Walmart's U.S. sales, according to its most recent annual report. Fresh groceries like fruits, vegetables and meats are especially a growth driver and influence where people choose to shop, Lehr said. \"Customers continue to tell us one of the biggest points of differentiation is they want to know where it comes from,\" Lehr said. \"They like to know and learn a little bit more about it rather than just seeing it on the meat counter. There's a greater drive and desire for them to know what the backstory is on the products that they're purchasing in store.\" During the past months of rising inflation, Walmart's reputation for low prices has attracted middle- and high-income shoppers looking to save on groceries and essentials, including some who may seek premium cuts of meat. In the most recent quarter ended July 31, Walmart said about three-quarters of the company's market share gains in food came from customers with annual household incomes of $100,000 or more. The discounter cut its full-year profit guidance last month, but increased its projections for sales growth, citing gains in its grocery category. Grocery shoppers, especially younger generations, expect more from their food \u2014 even as they watch their budget, said Rob Dongoski, food and agribusiness leader for consulting firm EY. Along with seeking tasty and affordable items, they consider other attributes, such as whether an animal was treated humanely or if produce was grown in a more sustainable way. They may look for labels associated with health or wellness, too, such as \"organic,\" \"grass-fed\" or \"antibiotic free.\" And, Dongoski said, some of those consumers are willing to pay more for them. \"There's a renewed interest in food,\" he said. \"Boomers and Gen Xers affiliated status with their car and their house and food was a necessity and needs-based purchase. If you look at Gen Zers and millennials, cars and houses are more needs-based and food is more status. We've seen a real difference in that attitude.\" Those evolving preferences have changed the look of Walmart's meat department, too. On a store tour earlier this summer with Walmart's Chief Merchandising Officer Charles Redfield near the big-box retailer's Arkansas headquarters, he pointed to fridges full of beef. Inside of the chilled area, there is now a larger number of steaks on black trays versus white ones. The black trays are for choice beef, a higher-quality cut that's juicier and more flavorful, and the white trays are for select beef, a lower standard of meat that's less marbled and tender. Three or four years ago about 70% of steaks at stores were in the white trays, he said; now, the mix has flipped."},

U.S. equities markets were primed for another selloff Thursday morning after closing out August on a losing streak. Things had looked promising for stocks this summer after a terrible first half of the year. Inflation eased, but only a bit \u2013 and that has the Federal Reserve ready to hike rates even more. Right now the Fed's benchmark rate is in the 2.25% to 2.5% range, but Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said Wednesday she sees rates rising significantly higher to over 4%. Nor does she expect the central bank to cut rates next year. The Fed is expected to hike rates by another three quarters of a point later this month. Shares of Nvidia fell in off-hours trading after the chip maker said the U.S. government is restricting sales to China out of concerns the Chinese military would use the company's products. Nvidia said it expects to lose about $400 million in revenue from China during the current quarter. The United States has in recent years sought to crack down on China from exploiting U.S.-made technology. Last month, President Joe Biden signed a bipartisan bill that was intended to boost America's chip-making sector in a bid to strengthen the country's competitive power in its economic struggle with China. Even Sam's Club, Walmart 's warehouse chain, isn't immune to inflation. The company said Wednesday that it was raising its entry-level membership fee for Sam's Club for the first time in nine years. Starting Oct. 17, members will pay $50 a year, up from $45. Warehouse stores have done well of late, as inflation-weary shoppers buy in bulk to save on essential items. Walmart's decision could put pressure on Sam's Club rival Costco, which charges $60 a year for its basic membership. In July, Costco's CEO, Craig Jelinek, told CNBC that he didn't think it was the \"right time\" to hike the club fee \u2014 or the price it charges for its famously inexpensive hot dogs. The FDA has approved a new round of Covid booster shots that target the highly contagious omicron BA.5 subvariant. The decision came as kids head back to school and many companies push their employees to return to the office in earnest. Experts expect Covid cases to rise this fall and winter, although with reduced death rates. Officials also have said that the new boosters \u2013 Pfizer 's are authorized for people 12 and older; Moderna 's for those 18 and up \u2013 should provide more lasting protection while keeping hospitalization rates down. UN inspectors delayed their inspection of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant amid nearby fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces. Ukraine's state nuclear power company said the plant's fifth reactor was also shut down due to the nearby shelling. The facility is occupied by the Russians, and Ukrainian officials have accused them of attempting to spoil the inspectors' visit. Ukraine President Volodomyr Zelenskyy, who welcomed the UN team Wednesday, has warned that the plant is vulnerable to a nuclear catastrophe as his forces seek to beat back Russian President Vladimir Putin's invading forces.

Reps. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva, D-Ariz., chair of the Natural Resources committee, and Kathy Castor, D-Fla., chair of the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, wrote a letter to the U.S. comptroller general on Tuesday arguing that climate offset programs are often fraudulent and mislead consumers without taking meaningful action. Carbon offset projects allow businesses, governments and people to balance out their own carbon emissions by supporting various climate initiatives that reduce or sequester an equal amount of carbon pollution. But some officials and climate advocates argue that these programs are often scams or forms of greenwashing because they don't result in additional emissions reductions. Offset projects often conserve habitats able to store carbon, including forests, grasslands, wetlands and blue carbon ecosystems (like mangroves and tidal salt marshes). In some cases, though, the habitats would have been preserved anyway, and long-term enforcement is seen by some as lax to nonexistent. What's more, there's currently no way to prevent double counting where the same credit is used by multiple parties. The representatives noted that the metrics to gauge the efficacy of such offsets \u2014 including measuring, reporting and verification \u2014 vary depending on the program. The difference in metrics makes it difficult for people to understand their purchase and for policymakers to quantify their impact, they said. The members requested that the Government Accountability Office conduct a study on federal efforts to quantify carbon reductions from offsets, and recommended actions agencies can take to increase transparency in private voluntary carbon offset markets and prevent fraud and abuse. \"Markets thrive with transparency, while a lack of transparency carries inherent market risk,\" the representatives wrote in the letter. \"Consumers of voluntary climate offsets require transparency and well-defined standards in the natural carbon offsets market given the wide variety and possibility for fraud.\" Some climate advocates have also argued that purchasing offset credits should count as climate philanthropy rather than as a way for organizations to balance out their emissions, and have urged emissions reductions through other methods, such as investing in permanent carbon removal. \"Because standards are nonexistent, it's easy to mislead consumers with the promise of carbon offsets,\" Huffman wrote in a tweet on Tuesday. \"We must ensure transparency so that when folks sign up to help the environment, it actually happens.\""},

Like many other business, the bakery uses a contactless and digital payment method, which prompts you to leave a tip when you pay. There are predetermined options ranging from 15% to 25% for each transaction. \"We encourage people to tip but it's not mandatory, obviously,\" Sirotkina said. Although the average transaction at Sweetly is less than $20, which means a gratuity would be a few dollars at most, fewer people leave anything at all. \"Only around 1 in 5 people tip,\" Sirotkina estimated.

Tipping 20% at a sit-down restaurant is still the standard, etiquette experts say. But there's less consensus when it comes to a carry-out coffee or take-away snack. Overall, tipping has remained largely flat at quick-service restaurants, according to Toast 's most recent restaurant trends report. Tips average 17%, nearly unchanged from a year ago. But when it comes to takeout, customers are tipping less \u2014 now down to 14.5%, on average, after climbing earlier in the pandemic, the restaurant software vendor found. Other payment software providers have also reported that these types of tips have fallen over the last year. For example, Toast's rival, Square, found that the average tip at quick-service restaurants, which includes cafes and coffee shops, fell from 17.2% to 15.2% from March 2021 to the end of February, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. \"Part of it is tip fatigue,\" said Eric Plam, founder and CEO of San Francisco-based startup Uptip, which aims to facilitate cashless tipping. \"During Covid, everyone was shell-shocked and feeling generous,\" Plam said. Now, \"you are starting to see people pull back a little bit,\" he noted, particularly when it comes to point-of-sale tipping, which prompts customers to tip even before they've received the product or service. \"This point-of-sale tipping is what people resist the most,\" he said, \"compelling you to tip right there on the spot.\" However, transactions are increasingly cashless and workers in the service industry are earning minimum or less than minimum wage so having a method to tip is critical, Plam added. In fact, the average wage for fast-food and counter workers is $14.34 an hour for full-time staff and $12.14 for part-time employees \u2014 including tips \u2014 according to the most recent data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. A landmark bill in California aims to raise the minimum wage to up to $22 an hour for fast-food and quick-service workers at chains with more than 100 locations nationally. California's current wage floor is $15.50 an hour. President Joe Biden and many Democratic lawmakers have pushed for a $15 hourly wage floor across the U.S. The current federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour and has remained unchanged since 2009. \"We are sympathetic but it doesn't feel good,\" Plam said of point-of-sale tipping. \"Now that the pandemic is essentially over, its starting to shake out now,\" he added. \"The good news is we're rethinking it.\" Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube."},
{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/01/small-businesses-desperate-for-workers-even-as-companies-slow-hiring.html", "title": "Small businesses are still desperate for workers even as other companies slow hiring", "tag": "Small Business Playbook", "author": "Ian Thomas", "datetime": "2022-09-01 12:30:01", "paragraphs": " While some companies have slowed the pace of hiring due to concerns about an economic slowdown, the demand from small businesses for new workers has not yet shown signs of declining, Paychex CEO Marty Mucci said. \"We're still not really seeing any strong recessionary measures here for small business,\" Mucci said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Tuesday. Hiring at U.S. small businesses with fewer than 50 employees has slowed for five straight months, according to data from Paychex and IHS Markit, but Mucci said that has more to do with a lack of applicants than a reflection of small businesses pulling back. \"For small businesses, the toughest thing is they have the demand, and they have the need for workers \u2014 they just have a little bit harder time finding it,\" he said. That is counter to what is happening at some larger companies. In August, private payrolls grew by 132,000, a drop from the 268,000 gain seen in July, according to ADP's monthly payroll report. ADP chief economist Nela Richardson told CNBC that the data \"suggests a shift toward a more conservative pace of hiring, possibly as companies try to decipher the economy's conflicting signals.\" \"We could be at an inflection point, from super-charged job gains to something more normal,\" she added. But the ADP data showed that while companies with 500 or more employees grew by 54,000 and medium-sized businesses added 53,000, those with fewer than 50 employees saw a 25,000 gain. Mucci said that there are small businesses that are feeling the \"inflationary pressure of wages.\" Hourly earnings on average were $30.71 in August, up $1.51 from the same month last year, according to Paychex. Hourly earnings were up 5.18 % in the month, matching a record set in May dating back to 2011. The difficulty of both finding workers and having to pay higher wages could lead to a continued slowing of hiring activity, Mucci said, adding that \"both of these things are going to slow [hiring] down a bit.\" Fifty percent of small business owners said it was harder to hire in the third quarter of 2022 than it was a year ago, according to a recent CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey, while 28% say they have open roles they haven't been able to fill for at least three months. While those figures are relatively unchanged from previous quarters, it highlights the difficulty around hiring that many small business owners are facing. There were 11.24 million job openings in July, with openings outnumbering available workers by nearly a 2-to-1 margin, according to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. Friday's August nonfarm payrolls release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics is expected to further the view that hiring demand remains high. That labor crunch has forced many small businesses to reduce hours or close on certain days, Mucci said. However, he noted there are record numbers of workers with at least two jobs, according to federal labor data. In July, there were 433,000 workers with two full-time jobs, compared to 401,000 in July 2021, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"A lot of people are looking for a second job, and hopefully small businesses will be the positive recipient of that,\" he said."},

On a call with investors, the New Jersey-based retailer laid out details of its latest turnaround push. It said it has started closing about 150 of its \"lower producing\" namesake stores. It will also slash costs by shrinking head count by about 20% across its corporate and supply chain workforce. To strengthen its balance sheet, the company said it secured more than $500 million in new financing, including a loan. The moves are urgently needed for the troubled retailer, which also disclosed Wednesday that slowing sales have carried into the most recent quarter. Same-store sales plummeted 26% for the three-month period ended Aug. 27 \u2014 an even steeper drop than the declines of recent quarters. Bed Bath's shares closed down 21% at $9.53 Wednesday. Its business had already taken many blows. The company said it lost hundreds of millions of dollars in sales because it didn't have items in stock. It was publicly criticized by activist investor Ryan Cohen, who later sold off his entire stake in the company. Former CEO Mark Tritton, who was chosen to carve out a successful strategy, was ousted by the board in June. Yet the company said its new approach can win back shoppers who have strayed to competitors. \"There is still an incredible degree of love for Bed Bath & Beyond,\" said Mara Sirhal, the newly named brand president of Bed Bath & Beyond. \"We must get back to our rightful place as the home category destination, and our goal is to achieve this by leading with the product and brands our customers want.\" For its baby goods chain, Buybuy Baby, the company also named Patty Wu as brand president. One of Bed Bath's crucial moves was finding a way to pay the bills and stabilize relationships with suppliers leery of working with a faltering company. It counts on those vendors to stock shelves and warehouses \u2014 especially during important seasons like back to college and the Christmas season. Bed Bath has burned through cash, ending May with about $100 million compared with $1.1 billion a year earlier. It said Wednesday it has a plan to cut costs and gain additional cash. It secured a $375 million loan through Sixth Street Partners, a lender that has provided financing to other retailers including J.C. Penney and Designer Brands. It has expanded $1.13 billion asset-backed revolving credit facility, too. Earlier in the day, it said in a filing that it will sell an undisclosed amount of shares. Along with the additional financing, it is slashing costs. Its store footprint will get about 16% smaller with the closures. As of late May, the company had 955 stores. That includes 769 namesake stores, 135 Buybuy Baby stores and 51 stores under its Harmon or Face Values brands. Bed Bath also said it is eliminating the jobs of chief operating officer and chief stores officer. To try to stand out from competitors, Bed Bath previously made an aggressive push into private-label products and launched nine exclusive brands since the spring of 2021. Yet instead of drumming up more sales, some shoppers felt disoriented by the unfamiliar names showcased prominently in store displays and had trouble finding the national brands they wanted. Now, Bed Bath will backpedal from that approach and bring back more of the name brands that people recognize, such as Calphalon, Cuisinart and Oxo, Sirhal said. It will discontinue three of its private-label brands \u2212 Haven, Wild Sage and Studio 3B \u2212 and significantly reduce the inventory of the others, she said. She said it will also work with national brands to develop exclusive products and add more direct-to-consumer brands. On the Buybuy Baby side, Wu said the baby goods chain wants to build on its brand and differentiate by becoming the go-to retailer and advisor for parents and families. \"If you think about how parents used to rely on volumes of heavy books to learn about what to expect, we're here to help new parents who are digitally savvy and native and who rely on their smartphones for everyday living,\" she said. In stores and online, Wu said it will demonstrate products, provide recommendations and build a community that parents can turn to for advice from pregnancy to early preschool years. Buybuy Baby is also seeking new standout products and automatically enrolling parents with a baby registry in its loyalty program, she said. Bed Bath's shares have been on a meme stock-fueled roller-coaster ride for months, rocketing up to $30.06 and falling to a low of $4.38 in the past year. As of Tuesday's close of $12.11, the shares are down about 17% year to date. Read the company's news release here."},

The remarks by Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald's U.S., come after the California state Senate earlier this week passed a bill that would give a 10-person council the authority to raise the industry's minimum wage to up to $22 an hour for chains with more than 100 locations nationally. California's current wage floor is $15.50 an hour. The council would also have the authority to establish safety conditions. Proponents of the bill say it will empower fast-food workers and help solve industry problems such as unsafe working conditions and wage theft, which can include not paying employees for overtime. But the FAST Act faces strong opposition from the restaurant industry, which fears the impact on California restaurants and the example it sets for other states. \"It imposes higher costs on one type of restaurant, while sparing another. That's true even if those two restaurants have the same revenues and the same number of employees,\" Erlinger wrote in a letter posted to the company's site Wednesday. For example, Erlinger said a McDonald's franchisee with two locations would be subject to the bill, since it's part of a large national chain. But he said the owner of 20 restaurants that aren't part of a chain would be exempt. \"Aggressive wage increases are not bad. ... But if it's essential to increase restaurant workers' wages and protect their welfare \u2013 and it is \u2013 shouldn't all restaurant workers benefit?\" Erlinger wrote. It's rare for McDonald's to speak out publicly against state legislation, although the chain was reportedly pushing its franchisees to lobby against the California bill. Nearly 10% of McDonald's U.S. restaurants are located in California, according to Citi Research. \"The legislative process has run its course over the past eight months on this bill, and I have had an open door policy to work with the administration, corporations, workers, and franchisees because I acknowledge the importance of working together,\" Assemblymember Chris Holden, a sponsor of the bill, said in a statement to CNBC. McDonald's only operates about 5% of its more than 13,000 U.S. locations. Its franchisees own the rest, but the chain often lobbies on their behalf. I n 2019, McDonald's told the National Restaurant Association it would no longer oppose federal, state or local minimum wage hikes. Other restaurant companies have been fighting the bill as well. State records show that Chipotle Mexican Grill, Chick-fil-A, Yum Brands and Restaurant Brands International are among the chains that have been spending money to lobby California lawmakers to oppose the legislation. The National Restaurant Association, an industry group, has also spent at least $140,000 to fight the bill, according to California records. The organization's president, Michelle Korsmo, said in a statement that 45% of California restaurant operators report that business conditions are worse today than they were three months ago. \"The FAST Act isn't going to achieve its objective of providing a better environment for the workforce, it's going to force the outcomes our communities don't want to see,\" she said. A stricter version of the FAST Act that would make franchisors like McDonald's liable for their franchisees' labor violations passed the California state Assembly. But the number of changes made to the Senate version mean the bill will have be voted on again in the Assembly or reconciled before it can make its way to Gov. Gavin Newsom's desk. Newsom hasn't indicated whether he'll sign or veto the bill, although his Department of Finance opposed the initial version of the legislation."},

Rival pet retailer Petco made similar remarks last week, though both noted a pullback in spending on products such as leashes and toys. The comments are in line with the trend of pet owners increasingly spoiling their cats and dogs with foods that are more like the dishes they'd feed themselves or other family members. To capitalize on the ongoing shift, Petco recently partnered with snack bar maker Clif to sell a version for pets. It also launched a line of frozen, human-grade meals for dogs. \"Pet parents are driving one of the biggest trends the pet industry has seen as they increasingly seek out fresh, human-grade food for all members of the family,\" Petco CEO Ron Coughlin said in a release. Coughlin said the growing \"humanization\" of animal companions is being led by Gen Z and Millennial consumers who are \"hyper focused\" on their pets' health and wellness. In addition to more premium foods, Chewy and Petco see their health products and services as a way to better compete with the low-price offerings from retailers such as Amazon and Walmart. Earlier this month, Chewy expanded its health offerings with CarePlus, a line of pet wellness and insurance offerings. For its second quarter, Chewy said net sales rose 12.8% from a year ago to $2.43 billion as shoppers shifted toward more fresh and premium food products. Petco said its sales rose 3.2% to $1.48 billion and reported a similar shift. Still, the pet category isn't shielded from the soaring inflation that's pressuring consumers. Both Petco and Chewy reported softening demand in products such as crates, beds, leashes and toys over the summer months. Chewy noted that such items don't have to be replaced as often as some other items, and that shoppers are opting to skip on them as prices rise. Chewy said the downturn in such products is temporary and that it expects demand will recover. Brian LaRose, Petco's chief financial officer, also said orders for the products \"are delayed, not canceled.\" Still, both companies tightened their full-year guidance, in part because of the softened demand. Both companies lowered their revenue guidance for the year. Petco said it now expects adjusted earnings per share of 77 to 81 cents. It previously forecast 97 cents to $1. Petco's shares are down down around 24% year to date, while Chewy's stock is down around 41%."},

The move sees the former NASA chief throw his experience and reputation behind a startup with a unique propellant technology. Bridenstine has joined up with larger, established organizations since leaving the space agency. Bridenstine served at NASA during former President Donald Trump's administration, and now holds a variety of roles within the space industry \u2013 including as senior advisor to private equity group Acorn Growth, and on the boards of Viasat and The Aerospace Corp. El Segundo, California-based Phase Four builds next-generation electric thrusters for small satellites, with six operating in orbit so far. The company has raised about $30 million in funding since its founding in 2015. Bridenstine told CNBC that Phase Four's approach of using radio frequency to utilize a wide variety of propellant types \u2013 including xenon, krypton, iodine and water \u2013 is \"going to be an absolute game changer for these proliferated [low Earth orbit satellite] constellations.\" Phase Four's propellant flexibility gives the company stability in the face of a geopolitical threat, Bridenstine said. Noble gases xenon and krypton \u2014 often used as spacecraft propellants \u2014 are \"not widely available\" and largely produced in Russia, Ukraine and China. \"The idea that we can get away from those traditional fuels and get into things like iodine and water, I think [should] significantly drop costs and create an environment where you don't have as many opportunities for disruption,\" Bridenstine said. That supply chain threat is also a focus of the Pentagon's work in space. \"I think the Space Force is very interested in making sure that that we do have consistent supply chains that are not at risk, and we don't have to be spending money with countries that aren't friendly with us,\" Bridenstine added. Phase Four has contracts to develop and produce thrusters from the Air Force and DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, as well as commercial orders from companies like Capella Space. The company has 32 employees and is expanding into a 23,000-square-foot facility in Hawthorne, California. It plans to raise another funding round in 2023 and to grow to about 50 people over the next 12 months. CEO Beau Jarvis told CNBC that his relationship with Bridenstine dates back to when Jarvis was a vice president at satellite imagery company Planet and the latter was a congressman. At the time, Bridenstine was \"trying to make it easier for small space companies to be able to work with the Department of Defense, or more broadly, the U.S. government,\" Jarvis said. \"Seeing some of what Jim has talked about more recently, in terms of having more sustainable space operations, and the potential for debris issues in space ... there's a lot of overlap [between] Jim's vision and our vision,\" Jarvis said."},

Here are the August delivery numbers for the three companies: Nio was the only company to grow on a monthly basis in August but U.S.-listed shares of the EV start-up fell more than 8%. Li Auto shares fell around 4% while Xpeng was down more than 6%. The Chinese economy is facing a number of challenges including a resurgence of Covid-19 that has seen major cities like Shanghai locked down. In the last few days Shenzhen, China's tech hub has enacted Covid restrictions and on Thursday, the mega city of Chengdu went into lockdown. While some cities may have opened up again, consumer sentiment remains fragile and uncertainty prevails as a result of China's \"zero-Covid\" policy. The world's second-largest economy is also facing a power crunch which is impacting electric vehicle charging stations. Last month, Tesla and Nio suspended some of their charging services. These issues are filtering through to EV sales. Bill Russo, CEO at Shanghai-based Automobility, told CNBC, the numbers are \"reflective of lingering supply chain issues as well as the fact that they're on the premium end of the price range and with the weakening economy, people are looking toward affordability and that's squeezing some of the higher priced models.\" Last month, Xpeng said it expects to deliver between 29,000 and 31,000 electric vehicles in the third quarter of the year. This guidance disappointed investors. Xpeng President Brian Gu said the guidance reflects the fact that the industry is entering a \"relatively slow season\" and that traffic in stores is less due to the Covid situation. Yanan Shen, president of Li Auto, said in an earnings call last month that the Covid outbreak \"severely affected\" the company's supply chains and that there are remaining \"disruptions and difficulties.\" Shen also said there had been a slowdown in order intake for its flagship Li ONE sports utility vehicle. Li Auto began to deliver its new L9 car to customers at the end of August. And the company said it is planning to launch and deliver a large SUV called the Li L8 in early November. That could be affecting sales of its Li ONE, according to Russo. \"Li has major new product launches with the L9 and L8 which is also impacting consumer demand for Li ONE. When new products come out, demand for the older model often suffers,\" Russo said. To spur demand, China said last month it would extend its tax exemption for new energy vehicle purchases until the end of 2023. Competition continues to heat up in China's electric vehicle market. Alongside Li Auto's new cars, Xpeng plans to begin deliveries of its new G9 SUV in October and launch two new vehicles next year."},

Fees will increase to $50 from $45 for club members and to $110 from $100 for members of its higher-tier level, \"Plus,\" which includes some additional perks. The changes take effect Oct. 17. It marks the first fee hike in nine years for the entry-level membership. Sam's Club has not raised the price of the \"Plus\" membership since it debuted in 1999. That brings Sam's closer in price to rival Costco, which charges $60 a year for its basic membership and $120 for its higher-tier \"Gold\" membership. Sam's Club is hiking annual fees as warehouse clubs benefit from budget-conscious customers. Shoppers turned to Costco, BJ's Wholesale Club and Sam's Club during the early months of the Covid pandemic to stock up on huge packs of toilet paper, household cleaners and cans of soup. In recent months, those shoppers have sought relief from inflation by seeking out cheaper gas and high volume discounts. At the same time, inflation may make the increase sting. In a note to members Wednesday afternoon, Sam's Club CEO Kath McLay said the company is \"mindful of the financial pressure on wallets right now.\" With that in mind, she said, Sam's Club will pick up the tab this year by reimbursing the fee increase in Sam's Cash that can be used at its stores. Investors have speculated about a potential hike in Costco's fees, too. The club last raised its fee in June 2017 and has historically bumped it up every 5\u00bd years, which would put it on track for this year. Costco CEO Craig Jelinek shook off talk of an increase on CNBC's \" Squawk on the Street\" in July. \"I can tell you that we think about it every year, but right now, in terms of the membership fee it's not on the table right at the moment,\" he said. \"I've made it very clear. I don't think it's the right time.\" Sam's Club has almost 600 stores across the U.S. and in Puerto Rico. It does not disclose its membership count, but said in the most recent quarter that it is at an all-time high. Membership income increased 8.9% in the quarter that ended July 31. Its sales growth is outpacing other parts of Walmart's business. Same-store sales at Sam's Club grew 9.5% in the most recently reported quarter versus 6.5% at Walmart U.S. Chief Member and Marketing Officer Ciara Anfield said Sam's Club decided to make the move because of investments in recent years, from elevating the quality of merchandise on its shelves to adding new and convenient ways to shop. In recent years, it has added curbside pickup at stores, offered same-day home delivery, refreshed its Member's Mark private brand and launched Scan & Go, a smartphone app that people can use to ring up items as they walk through aisle. It has started carrying brands such as Eddie Bauer, La Mer and Banana Republic. And even some of its bakery treats have gotten a gourmet spin, such as cinnamon rolls made with a French baking technique. She compared the rollout of those new perks to building a house or spending money on renovation projects. \"There's an expectation that after you invest in this home, it will be worth more,\" Anfield said. \"We've made investments and we believe our proposition, our membership is now worth more.\""},

Here are their stories. Job: Emmy-award winning TV host of \" Samantha Brown's Places to Love\"\nStarted in: Comedy \" I went to Syracuse University for musical theater because I so desperately wanted to move to New York City and become a thespian. I wanted to do Shakespeare and be on Broadway. That didn't pan out. I waited on tables for a good eight years. But I loved improv, and I was a part of an improv comedy troupe. So I just kept auditioning for jobs. A writer recommended me to a production company that was \u2026 looking for a host. But my audition for it had to be totally improvised. That's how I got the job. When you are a travel host, there's no script. Yet it is still up to you to define the scene, to understand the trajectory of a story and how to end it. Also in improv, the golden rule is to never say no, it's always yes \u2014 to keep things going. Waiting on tables in New York City for eight years, you start to be really humbled, [but] those were the tools that I had that got me a job that I never in my wildest dreams thought I would ever have.\" Job: Creator of \" Strictly Dumpling\" and other YouTube channels (total: about 8 million subscribers)\nStarted in: Accounting and wedding videography \"I moved to the U.S. from China when I was 8 years old. My parents started working in restaurants, and eventually started their own very Americanized Chinese restaurant. So I grew up on a steady diet of General Tso's chicken and crab rangoon. There wasn't a lot of diversity where I'm from, but it helped that my parents sent me back to China when I was 13. Most people get grounded and sent to their room as a punishment \u2014 I got sent to China for two years. That's when I was like: Wow, it's so amazing \u2014 the people, the history \u2014 I want to know more. After college, I went to New York and worked on Wall Street for a year. Then I became a wedding videographer because I wanted to be flexible. I was living in a small basement apartment in Brooklyn with no air conditioning, making about $400 \u2014 on a good week. But this was the first time I was eating something that wasn't Red Lobster and Olive Garden. I got a taste of diverse ethnic food in Chinatown, and I started to discover a lot of my heritage that I never really saw as important before. I started recording food videos on YouTube as a food diary for myself. I remember having a conversation with a friend that food content will never amount to anything. There wasn't anybody online doing it. I had like 10 subscribers. Somehow it grew to this, which was never expected. I never really had much money growing up \u2014 or throughout most of my adulthood. So I was always looking for things that were inexpensive but also really filling and delicious. And that's pretty much what I do around the world now.\" Job: Television host of \" Family Travel with Colleen Kelly\"\nStarted in: Sales \"I tried out for the broadcast school at the University of Texas. The school gave you one chance to be accepted into the program. I had never sat at an anchor desk with a camera pointed at me. I failed miserably. Several years later, I graduated and got my first job in sales, eventually moving to Chicago and working in the pharmaceutical industry. The money was amazing, and I had a company car. But I wasn't living my dream, and this started to really bother me. In my early 30s, I got married and eventually quit my job to be a stay-at-home mom. One day, when my two little girls were in school, I went to our town hall's cable TV station and asked if, in exchange for teaching me how to edit, I could host the local entertainment show about our village \u2014 something like \"Access Hollywood\" for our 50,000-resident town. Because they had no other offers, they said yes. I acted confident, but I was as green as they come. I was shaking in my boots every time I did an interview and read voice-over, but I was gaining experience and knowledge. I confided in another mom that my dream was to host a national travel show, and, surprisingly, she agreed to produce it with me. We wrote a script, found a local camera guy for a few dollars and made a pilot. I took meetings with two major companies \u2014 both said no. I was told by one network that women don't watch travel shows, so the concept of family travel didn't appeal to them. I then sent thousands of emails to television stations. Nothing worked. Finally, my mother suggested I call the local PBS station. I googled the head of programming, called him (no emails) and got a meeting. After more meetings, we learned PBS was picking two shows to go national, and \"Family Travel with Colleen Kelly\" was one of them. We scraped by for a year, producing 13 episodes that first season. Now, the show has been on for more than 10 years. And, the best part is that I can bring my family with me. It's been a long and arduous journey, but I hope this story inspires others to believe in themselves, ignore the naysayers, and never give up on their dream.\" Editor's note: These interviews have been edited for length and clarity."},
{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/01/gatorade-adds-caffeine-to-its-lineup-with-energy-drink-fast-twitch.html", "title": "Gatorade adds caffeine to its lineup with energy drink Fast Twitch", "tag": "Food & Beverage", "author": "Amelia Lucas", "datetime": "2022-09-01 13:00:02", "paragraphs": " Gatorade is entering the energy drink category with a caffeinated spin-off called Fast Twitch. It represents yet another example of beverage companies blurring the lines between drink categories, seeking to leverage existing brand loyalty while entering fast-growing categories. Gatorade's parent company, PepsiCo, has already expanded Mountain Dew into alcoholic and energy drinks. The company says Fast Twitch is designed to give athletes an extra boost before their workouts. The market for preworkout powders is growing, fueled by industry leaders such as Cellucor C4 and RSP Nutrition. But few preworkout drinks exist, and many consumers instead turn to carbonated, sugary energy drinks. Anuj Bhasin, general manager of Gatorade, said roughly 32 million consumers reject the energy drink category for the negative health effects. Fast Twitch aims to attract those consumers, offering plenty of caffeine but no sugar or carbonation. The new drink is slated to launch in February, but NFL players will be drinking it on sidelines during the upcoming season as part of an exclusive deal with the league. Bhasin said Gatorade worked with the NFL and its sports performance experts to develop the specific formula. The finished product comes in a petite 12-ounce bottle with brightly colored packaging. While smaller, it tastes pretty similar to traditional Gatorade. A bottle of Fast Twitch contains electrolytes, B-vitamins and 200 milligrams of caffeine. For comparison, a 12-ounce can of Red Bull has nearly half as much caffeine but 37 grams of sugar. Bolt24, another recent offshoot of Gatorade, has just 75 milligrams of caffeine in its Energize line, which is being phased out. \"Two hundred milligrams is the right amount to help athletes seeking benefits for exercise performance,\" said Matthew Pahnke, senior principal scientist at the Gatorade Sports Science Institute. Since its creation nearly six decades ago, Gatorade has built its brand on hydration, spreading the word about the benefits of electrolytes and carbohydrates. But caffeine is a natural diuretic, removing salt and water from the body. As a result, Fast Twitch is meant to precede drinking a more hydrating beverage during an actual workout, the company says. \"We know athletes will mix and match things,\" Pahnke said. Fast Twitch will target consumers who are 18 years old or older due to the high caffeine content, according to Bhasin. Fast Twitch follows a broader push by Pepsi into energy drinks. Over the last three years, the company bought Rockstar Energy for $3.85 billion, launched Mtn Dew Rise Energy with the endorsement of NBA superstar Lebron James and acquired a minority stake in up-and-coming energy drink maker Celsius for $550 million. Celsius is a potential competitor for Fast Twitch. The upstart markets its beverages as \"fitness drinks,\" and its marketing shows models swinging kettle bells and stretching. Another challenger also has ties to Gatorade's parent company. Bang Energy, which recently ended an acrimonious distribution deal with Pepsi, markets itself as a preworkout or recovery drink. Beyond being highly caffeinated, it touts \"super creatine,\" which claims to boost muscle performance, but no sugar. But Pepsi is already the dominant leader in the U.S. sports drink category, holding 73.2% market share with Gatorade and G Zero, according to Euromonitor International data. Bodyarmor jumped to second place in 2021 with 11.7% market share, overtaking Coca-Cola 's Powerade. Coke purchased full control of Bodyarmor in November for $5.6 billion in a play to increase its market share. Changing consumer tastes led to slowing sales growth for the sports drink market, even as U.S. adults exercise more. Years of backlash from lawmakers and pediatricians about sports drinks' high sugar and calorie counts didn't help either. But Gatorade staged a comeback, focusing on options with more electrolytes and less sugar, such as recent spin-offs G Fit, Gatorlyte and Bolt24. In the second quarter, Pepsi reported double-digit revenue growth for the Gatorade brand. However, not all of Gatorade's innovations have paid off. An organic version of the drink released in 2016 failed to take off and was discontinued several years later. Energy represents an opportunity in a fast-growing segment, but it lacks trust from consumers who exercise. Gatorade, on the other hand, has earned plenty of trust from that customer base. \"We found this to be the sweet spot of bringing a new brand to market, with the distinction of being from the makers of Gatorade, much like Propel,\" Bhasin said."},
{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/23/monkeypox-scientists-worry-virus-could-infect-animals-.html", "title": "A dog in France has monkeypox, worrying scientists that we won't be able to eradicate the virus if it spreads to more animals", "tag": "Health and Science", "author": "Spencer Kimball", "datetime": "2022-08-23 12:19:58", "paragraphs": " In 2003, 47 people across six Midwestern states caught monkeypox from pet prairie dogs that were infected after they were housed with rodents imported from Ghana, Africa. Today's outbreak, which has already infected more than 14,100 people in the U.S. and more than 41,000 across the globe, is spreading mostly through close human contact among gay and bisexual men. But scientists reported the first presumed human-to-pet transmission in a dog in France this month, prompting U.S. and global health officials to step up warnings to ensure the virus doesn't spread to other pets and animals. The recommendation stems from concerns that monkeypox could spill into wildlife or rodent populations as the human outbreak grows, allowing the virus to pass back-and-forth between humans and animals and giving the virus a permanent foothold in countries where it hasn't historically circulated. Prior to the global outbreak this year, monkeypox spread primarily in remote parts of West and Central Africa where people caught the virus after exposure to infected animals. The 2003 outbreak, which was contained, was the first documented case of humans catching the virus outside Africa. The current global outbreak differs dramatically from past patterns of transmission. Monkeypox is now spreading almost entirely through close physical contact between people in major urban areas in the U.S., European nations and Brazil. But the first presumed case of people infecting an animal in the current outbreak was reported in France this month. A pet dog tested positive for the virus after a couple in Paris fell ill with monkeypox and shared their bed with the animal. WHO officials have said a single incident of a pet catching the virus is not surprising or a cause for major concern, but there is a risk that monkeypox could start circulating in animals if people don't know they can infect other species. If monkeypox becomes established in animal populations outside Africa, the virus would have more opportunities to mutate, which carries the risk of higher transmissibility and severity. Animals could then potentially give the virus to people, increasing the risk of future outbreaks. \"What we don't want to see happen is disease moving from one species to the next and then remaining in that species,\" said Dr. Mike Ryan, director of the WHO's health emergencies program, said during a press conference in Geneva last week. \"It's through that process of one animal affecting the next and the next and the next that you see rapid evolution of the virus.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not received any reports of pets infected with monkeypox in the U.S., said Kristen Nordlund, an agency spokesperson. But the virus can spread from people to animals or from animals to people, according to the CDC. \"While we are still learning which species of animals can get monkeypox, we should assume any mammal can be infected with monkeypox virus,\" Nordlund said. \"We do not know if reptiles, amphibians, or birds can get monkeypox, but it is unlikely since these animals have not been found to be infected with viruses in the same family as monkeypox.\" Dr. Rosamund Lewis, the WHO's lead monkeypox expert, said it's important to dispose of potentially contaminated waste properly to avoid the risk of rodents and other animals becoming infected when they rummage through garbage. \"While these have been hypothetical risks all along, we believe that they are important enough that people should have information on how to protect their pets, as well as how to manage their waste, so that animals in general are not exposed to the monkeypox virus,\" Lewis said. Ryan said that while vigilance is important, animals and pets do not represent a risk to people at the current time. \"It's important that we don't allow these viruses to establish themselves in other animal populations,\" Ryan said. \"Single exposures or single infections in particular animals is not unexpected.\" Although scientists have done some research on monkeypox in Africa, where it's historically circulated, their work was limited due to a lack of funding. So scientists don't know how many different species of animals can carry the virus and transmit it to humans. Scientists have only isolated monkeypox from wild animals a handful of times in Africa over the past 40 years. They included rope squirrels, target rats and giant pouched rats in the Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as two types of monkeys in Cote d'Ivoire. Rodents, not monkeys, are thought to be the host animal population in Africa, though the precise animal reservoir is unknown. Public health officials don't know whether the types of animals in close proximity to people in urban settings in the U.S. -- racoons, mice and rats -- can pick up and transmit the virus. Some types of mice and rats can get monkeypox but not all species are susceptible, according to the CDC. \"We know this is a virus that's transmitted from rodents in West Africa,\" said Dr. Peter Hotez, an infectious disease expert at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas. \"Could rats or other rodents in urban environments mean that it gains a foothold there and it also becomes more of a permanent fixture \u2014 we don't want that to happen,\" he said. The CDC recommends that people who have monkeypox avoid contact with animals \u2014 pets, livestock, domestic animas and wildlife. If a pet becomes sick within 21 days of contact with someone who has monkeypox, the animal should be evaluated by a veterinarian. Waste contaminated with monkeypox should go into in a lined, dedicated trash can and shouldn't be left outside because wildlife could potentially become exposed the virus, according to CDC. In the 2003 outbreak, the CDC was able to quickly administer vaccines and quarantine patients before the virus could spread farther. There were no cases of monkeypox spreading between people. The CDC then banned the importation of rodents from Africa. Containing the 2003 outbreak took 10,000 hours of work to trace the virus back to Gambian rats and other rodents imported from Ghana to an animal distributor in Texas, according to Marguerite Pappaioanou, a former CDC official who worked on the outbreak. The Food and Drug Administration banned the importation of all African rodents in the wake of the 2003 outbreak. The agency also prohibited the interstate distribution of prairie dogs and their release into the wild over concerns monkeypox could become established in wildlife populations. The U.S. Georgical Survey and Department of Agriculture subsequently trapped 200 wild animals in Wisconsin at sites close to where humans contracted monkeypox from pet prairie dogs. They did not find any evidence that the virus had spread into wild animals, and the FDA lifted the ban on distributing prairie dogs between states. It's still illegal to import rodents from Africa. Scientists in California detected monkeypox DNA in sewage samples this summer. New York is also conducting wastewater surveillance for the virus, according to the state health department, though results have not been publicly released yet. The wastewater findings in California have raised concern among some health experts that the virus could infect rodents through the sewage. \"There is the risk because of the widespread nature of infections and the fact that it's sewage and wastewater,\" said Dr. James Lawler, an infectious disease expert at Global Center for Health Security at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. \"That's a concern, about getting into an animal population and having a zoonotic risk reservoir and honestly, if that's the case that I think it's game over for us.\" But it's not clear if live virus is present in wastewater. The study measured monkeypox DNA in sewage samples, not whether the virus was still infectious, according to Marlene Wolfe, a scientist at Emory University who is working on the project. Wastewater is treated in most urban areas so the probability of the virus surviving and replicating in such an environment is low, according to Amira Roess, a former official with the CDC's Epidemiological Intelligence Service. Roess said garbage that contains contaminated materials such as bedsheets or towels likely poses a higher risk than wastewater. \"There are wildlife species that rummage in your garbage and then they're more likely to pick up virus that is able to replicate. \"There's a lot of ifs, but it happens,\" said Roess, who is now a professor of epidemiology at George Mason University. Several steps would have to take place for the monkeypox virus to spill over from humans into animals and then spill back into people causing another outbreak, according to Richard Reithinger, an epidemiologist at RTI International. The virus would have to circulate in an animal population with a wide geographic distribution, but not cause so much mortality in the species that the train of transmission is snuffed out, Reithinger said. Humans would also need to have some level of regular contact with animals. \"Each step has a certain probability. Once once you kind of add up all the probabilities of these steps, the probability actually becomes quite low,\" Reithinger said. It's also possible that monkeypox might be transmitting more efficiently among people in the current outbreak due to some sort of viral mutation, Roess said. If the virus has adapted to humans, it could be more difficult for people to give the disease to animals, she added. It also depends on what kind animal comes into contact with the virus, according to Pappaioanou. \"All animals are not susceptible. We don't even know which ones are,\" said Pappaioanou, who is now an affiliate professor at the University of Washington. Although the risk of the virus becoming entrenched in a U.S. animal population and causing future human outbreaks is low, the U.S. needs a more robust surveillance system to prepare for such a possibility, according to Pappaioanou and Roess. There are major gaps in the ability of public health agencies to monitor animal populations for infectious diseases, the former CDC officials said. \"It's a very big gap. We don't have a good surveillance system for humans,\" Roess said. \"For wildlife, it depends on who is interested in what pathogen and if they're able to convince someone to fund surveillance. A lot of our surveillance is just really sporadic\" Livestock such as cows, sheep and poultry are monitored by the Department of Agriculture, Pappaioanou said. But wildlife surveillance is underfunded and it takes a tremendous amount of work to monitor these animals for infectious disease, she said There's no government agency that overseas the health of dogs and cats, she said.

Senate Bill 1137 would prohibit the California Geologic Energy Management Division from approving a new oil well within 3,200 feet of residential neighborhoods, but would not ban existing wells within those areas. The legislation is a part of a broader climate package that Gov. Gavin Newsom endorsed in recent weeks. The decision comes after similar efforts to ban fracking and instate a buffer zone failed last year in a state committee vote. California is the seventh-largest oil-producing state in the U.S. but hasn't had regulations on how far active oil wells should be from populated areas. More than 2 million people live within 2,500 feet of an operational oil and gas well and an additional 5 million, or 14% of the California's population, live within 1 mile, according to an analysis by the non-profit FracTracker Alliance. Research shows that residents who live near drilling sites are at greater risk of preterm births, asthma, respiratory disease and cancer. Oil drilling has disproportionately harmed Black and Latino residents in major oil fields such as Los Angeles County and Kern County. \"Passage of this monumental bill is a tribute to the tireless frontline communities who have fought for their lives against fossil fuel polluters for years,\" Hollin Kretzmann, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity's Climate Law Institute, said in a statement. \"California has more work to do on climate and environmental justice, but these protections are a huge step toward a healthier, safer, more sustainable future,\" Kretzmann said. Other oil producing states like Colorado, Pennsylvania and Texas have already implemented various forms of buffer zones between communities and oil wells. California's new restrictions would likely take a couple years to go into effect. The buffer zone bill was part of a broader suite of climate measures approved by the California legislature this week. State lawmakers approved legislation to establish a target for 90% clean electricity by 2035 and achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. Lawmakers also approved measures to expedite permits for carbon capture and storage, and voted to extend the operations of Diablo Canyon, the state's last remaining operating nuclear power plant."},

The employees, who spoke with CNBC on the condition of anonymity, said since they have been asked to return to offices, infections notifications pop up in their email inboxes regularly. Employees are reacting with frustration and memes. The company began requiring most employees to return to physical offices at least three days a week in April. Since then, staffers have pushed back on the mandate after they worked efficiently for so long at home while the company enjoyed some of its fastest revenue growth in 15 years. Google has offered full-time employees the option to request permanent remote work, but it's unclear how many workers have been approved. Google\u2019s Covid-19 outbreak in Los Angeles is currently the largest of any employer in LA., according to the city\u2019s public health dashboard. Deadline.com first reported that the tech giant\u2019s trendy Silicon Beach campus in Venice, Calif., recorded 145 infections while 135 cases were recorded at the company\u2019s large Playa Vista campus. A spokesperson for Google told CNBC, \"There has not been a significant increase of onsite COVID-19 transmission on our campuses. The numbers that have been reported in Playa Vista and Venice reflect total cases over the last few months, not current or active cases.\" Staffers have been filling Memegen, an internal company image-sharing site, with memes about the increased number of exposure notifications they're receiving. One meme, which was upvoted 2,840 times, showed a photo of an inbox with the email subject from a San Francisco-based facilities manager stating \u201cWe\u2019re so excited to see you back in the office!\u201d and a subsequent email subject line stating \u201cNotification of Confirmed COVID-19 Case.\u201d Another meme with hundreds of upvotes said \u201cHow it started\u201d with an image of a rainbow arch followed by \u201cHow it\u2019s going\u201d and a wall of text saying \u201cNotification of confirmed Covid-19 case.\u201d Another featured an illustration of a happy Pokemon touring a Bay Area campus next to another photo of a worried Pokemon after getting a Covid-19 notification followed by an alarmed Pokemon with 29 exposure notifications. Another meme shows a picture of Star Wars character Rey, whose caption says \u201cI didn\u2019t know there was this much \u2018Notification of Confirmed COVID-19 Cases\u2019 in the whole galaxy.\u201d Some employees said they received a spike in notifications from the Mountain View, Calif. headquarters and in San Francisco offices after the company held a return-to-office celebration, where Grammy award-winning artist Lizzo performed for thousands of employees at the Shoreline Amphitheater, near Google's main campus. The spokesperson for Google also noted that the company follows methodology laid out by state and local laws in determining the definition of a Covid outbreak, and when to send exposure emails. Last December, Google told employees that they must comply with vaccine policies or they'd face losing pay and then losing their job. Then in February, ahead of asking employees to come back, it relaxed rules around vaccines being a requirement for employment, as well as other rules around testing, social distancing and masks. But it continued to require Covid-19 vaccination to enter physical offices. Now, some Google employees are asking the company to drop the vaccine mandate, arguing Covid-19 outbreaks keep happening anyway in the offices where employees are fully vaccinated. While it still provides a level of protection, the vaccines aren't as strong against the highly transmissible BA.5 variant, the fastest-spreading variant of Covid-19 to date, the group argues in a manifesto called \u201cNo Vaccine Mandate,\" which was posted this month and viewed by CNBC. (The vaccines are still providing good protection against severe disease and death, including with the BA.5 variant, but are not providing substantial protection against infection or mild illness.) The anonymous manifesto says the group, which calls itself Googlers for No Vaccine Mandate, is frustrated that non-vaccinated employees and those who decline to declare their vaccination status are still banned from offices and other gatherings including off-sites, summits and team events. It also claims that some Google employees still haven't met their teams since March 2020 and some were never notified of the vaccination policy during their hiring process. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen waves of Covid-particularly since December 2021 with Omicron and its sub variants spread through Google offices with little regard for vaccination status. We\u2019ve seen many fully vaccinated and boosted colleagues call out sick for multiple days with Covid. We\u2019ve seen both panics and good natured responses to the flood of exposure notifications received by officegoers.\" Other companies that once mandated Covid vaccination requirements have since dropped them, including Boeing, Intel, and United Airlines, citing a federal court\u2019s decision to prohibit enforcement of the federal contractor executive order that required vaccination of large employers that are also government contractors. The group's manifesto says it is hoping Google leadership does the same thing. The group is largely anonymous, although some members' identities are known to CNBC. It claims to include hundreds of employees with tenures of up to 10 years, in roles such as engineering, program management, UX design, education, sales, marketing and finance. It also includes Googlers who are fully vaccinated and \u201cbelieve the company\u2019s vaccine policy is an invasion of privacy and is insensitive to individual circumstances and risk factors.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re writing to ask for your help for a group of Googlers who still aren\u2019t allowed back to our offices,\" the memo states. \u201cWe are reaching out to you as colleagues and peers because our direct appeals to Google leadership have been ignored. When planning an in-person meeting, summit or offsite, think about how Googlers who are barred from full participation by the vaccine policy can be acknowledged and included.\""},

Although monkeypox cases are still increasing nationally, the speed of the outbreak appears to be slowing, Walensky said. The U.S. has reported nearly 17,000 monkeypox cases since May, more than any other country in the world, according to CDC data. In New York City, which has reported more infections than any other jurisdiction, new monkeypox cases have dropped from more than 70 per day on average to nine as of Thursday, according to data from the city health department. Dr. Aswhin Vasan, the city health commissioner, said earlier this week the outbreak has slowed due to increased vaccination and community outreach efforts. New York City has reported a total of 2,888 monkeypox cases. In Chicago, another major epicenter of the outbreak, new cases have dropped from 141 during the week ended July 30 to 74 for the week ended Aug. 20, according to that city's health department. Chicago has reported a total of 807 cases. \"We're not seeing the potentially exponential growth that we were seeing early on so that is reassuring,\" said Dr. Allison Arwady, Chicago's public health commissioner, during a Facebook live event earlier this week. \"Too early to say things look really good, but definitely some signs of slowing of cases.\" The U.S. is nearing the point where the entire community of gay and bisexual men who currently face the greatest health risk from monkeypox rwill have access to two doses of the monkeypox vaccine, according to Dawn O'Connell, head of the office responsible for the national stockpile at the Health and Human Services Department. The CDC previously estimated that up to 1.7 million gay and bisexual men who are HIV-positive or are eligible for medicine to reduce their chance of contracting HIV face the greatest health risk from monkeypox. The U.S. has distributed 1.5 million doses of the monkeypox vaccine so far and more than 3 million doses should be available by when the latest distribution round is complete, according to O'Connell. To date, the outbreak is disproportionately affecting Black and Hispanic men. About 30% of monkeypox patients are white, 32% are Hispanic and 33% are Black, according to CDC data. Whites make up about 59% of the U.S. population while Hispanics and Blacks account for 19% and 13%, respectively. The monkeypox vaccine, called Jynneos in the U.S., is administered in two doses 28 days apart. The patients will not have full protection from the vaccine until two weeks after the second dose is administered, according to the CDC. Data from 19 jurisdictions show that nearly 97% of the shots administered so far were first doses, according to Walensky. About 94% of monkeypox cases are associated with sexual contact and nearly all of the people who have contracted the virus are men who have sex with men, according to Demetre Daskalakis, the deputy head of the White House monkeypox response team. A CDC survey of 824 gay and bisexual men found that 48% respondents have reduced their number of sexual partners and 50% have reduced one-time sexual encounters during the current outbreak. A separate CDC study found that a 40% decrease in one-time sexual encounters would reduce the final percentage of gay and bisexual men infected with monkeypox by up to 31%. \"We're actually seeing vaccine get out, behaviors change, harm-reduction messages being heard and implemented,\" Walensky said. \"And all of that working together to bend the curve.\" Correction: 33% of confirmed monkeypox cases are among Black Americans. A previous version of this story misstated the figure."},

The country is also set to remove indoor mask requirements from Aug. 29, as it seeks to take another step toward living with Covid. While the further easing of safety and border measures is a \"significant milestone,\" the country must still \"be mentally prepared for any sudden change because we don't know how this virus will mutate and what the next variant will look like,\" said Singapore's deputy prime minister Lawrence Wong, who is also co-chair of the Covid task force in Singapore. Visitors who are not fully vaccinated will still be required to test negative for Covid within 2 days prior to their departure for Singapore. But they will no longer need to serve a 7-day quarantine at home or at their place of residence. Currently, fully vaccinated travelers can enter Singapore without taking Covid-19 tests or undergoing quarantine. Non-vaccinated long-term visitors and short-term visitors who are 13 years and above are currently required to apply for entry approval to enter Singapore. This requirement will also be lifted from Monday, according to the Ministry of Health. Masks will be optional indoors and required in special settings, such as on public transportation and in health-care settings like hospitals, residential care homes and ambulances from Monday, the health ministry said. They are optional in taxis, private hires and in the airport. \"The reason is that, we have identified areas where essential services are being carried out in enclosed, crowded spaces and which are frequently used by vulnerable persons,\" said Wong, who is also the country's finance minister. The decision to lift mask requirements was first announced by Prime Minster Lee Hsien Loong on Sunday. Currently, masks are required in nearly all indoor settings, with the exception of workplaces where there are no physical interaction or customer-facing areas. \"For business and employers, they have the discretion to decide whether or not they might want to do this [from] a workplace safety point of view \u2026 we are lifting a mandatory requirement for mask-wearing but it is optional,\" said Wong. In preparation for the next wave of omicron, the health ministry said a second mRNA Covid booster is now recommended for those who are 60 years and above. Previously, second boosters were only recommended for those who were 80 years and older. Around 93% of the population completed the primary vaccination series as of Monday, while 79% of the total population received boosters. The high booster rate is a \"key reason\" that the nation has been able to ride through the current Covid wave, said Singapore's health minister Ong Ye Kung. Ong stressed the need to expand recommendations of second boosters to those who are 60 to 79 years old \u2014 five months after their first booster \u2014 even though the first booster has provided strong protection against severe illnesses for those in this age group. The health ministry also recommended that children between 5 to 11 years old receive one booster \u2014 five months after the second dose of their primary vaccination series \u2014 to boost their protection. Plans are in place for a potential new Covid wave, perhaps in the winter, said Wong. \"We are continuing to monitor closely and we have drawer plans in place for various contingencies including scaling up our healthcare capacity as well as \u2026 vaccination operations if and when the need arises,\" Wong said at the press conference on Wednesday. He added that those plans would \"buy us time,\" should there be a Covid wave that is aggressive and dangerous. Average daily infections over a 7-day period fell to 2,700 as of Tuesday, as daily infections continued to fall from a record 26,032 infections on Feb. 22. Most of those infected in Singapore have mild or no symptoms. The Southeast Asian country further eased Covid measures at the end of April. Social gatherings will no longer be limited to 10 people and people will not need to keep 1 meter apart. In April, separate rules for unvaccinated people were also removed, with some exceptions. Those who are not vaccinated will still not be allowed to dine in, or participate in events with more than 500 people. Neither can they visit nightlife establishments where dancing is involved. However, food and beverage outlets won\u2019t be required to check the vaccination statuses of customers, the health ministry said in a press release."},

But booking airfare on a certain day of the week isn't one of them, according to data from Google Flights. Booking mid-week \u2014 and especially Tuesdays around midnight \u2014 is often cited as the best time to purchase flights. But in the past five years, U.S. airfares purchased on Tuesdays, Wednesday or Thursdays have been only 1.9% cheaper on average than airfares purchased during the weekend, according to Google Flights. \"If your trip is just a couple of weeks away, don't wait for Tuesday to roll around \u2014 book your flight now in case the price goes up,\" wrote James Byers, Google Flights' group product manager, on a blog post published yesterday. While the day of the week travelers book may not matter much, the day they fly does, according to Google Flights' research, which examined five years of historical flight data from Aug. 1, 2017 to Aug. 1, 2022. \"On average, flights that depart on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday have been 12% cheaper than weekend departures,\" wrote Byers. \"If you exclude international destinations, the potential savings jump even higher to 20%.\" Another common strategy \u2014 booking early \u2014 also works, according to the data. For U.S. domestic flights, airfares have been lowest between three and eight weeks before a departure date, with prices \"bottoming out\" 44 days out, according to the research. Non-stop flights cost on average about 20% more than connecting flights, according to Google Flights, but flights with stops also increase the risk of interruptions. An Instagram poll by the travel insurance company World Nomads indicated more than 1 in 3 respondents spent up to $250 on flights, meals or hotels because of flight delays or cancellations this summer, while 12% reported spending between $500 to $1,000. Travelers with flexible flying days can use Google Flights' \"date grid\" function to quickly ascertain the cheapest dates to depart and arrive in a given week. Those who want to travel for a specific duration \u2014 say, two weeks \u2014 but are flexible on when, can use the \"price graph\" function to see the cheapest times to fly too. Price tracking also eliminates the need to search again and again to price-check a desired route. Search the route once, hit the button to \"track prices\" and Google Flights will send notifications of airfare changes via email. Based on its historical data, Google Flights also suggests the \"best times\" to book flights for peak-period travel and popular routes. Travelers hoping to save money on airfare to Europe are advised to plan the earliest, while summer vacationers can consider making plans weeks, rather than months, in advance."},

It is the first time the FDA has authorized an updated vaccine formula since the original shots rolled out in December 2020. Pharmacies are expected to start administering the new boosters after Labor Day weekend. The U.S. has secured 171 million doses of Pfizer's and Moderna's updated shots so far, according to the Health and Human Services Department. Pfizer's new booster dose is authorized for people ages 12 and older, while Moderna's new shots are authorized for adults ages 18 and older. The eligible age groups can receive the boosters two months after completing their primary series or their most recent booster with the old shots. The U.S. will no longer use the original vaccines as booster doses for individuals ages 12 and older now that the the updated shots have been authorized, according to the FDA. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has to sign off on the boosters before pharmacies can give them to patients. The CDC's independent advisory committee is scheduled to meet Thursday and Friday to review the data and issue its recommendations for health-care providers. Public health officials believe the redesigned boosters will provide longer-lasting protection against the virus and reduce hospitalizations this fall and winter. The new boosters target both the original strain that emerged in China more than two years ago, which scientists refer to as the \"wild type,\" and omicron BA.4 and BA.5, which are now the dominant variants in the U.S. Shots that target two different strains are called bivalent vaccines. The vaccine makers developed the original shots against the strain of Covid that first emerged in Wuhan, China, in 2019. But the virus has mutated dramatically since then. Omicron and its subvariants have drifted so much from the original Covid strain that the virus is able to slip past the protective antibodies induced by the vaccines. As a consequence, the shots' effectiveness at preventing infection and mild illness has declined substantially as the virus has evolved. Though the vaccines are still generally preventing severe disease, the protection they provide against hospitalization has slipped over time as well. \"There is declining effectiveness against hospitalization and severe illness. The problem has been persuading the American people to get boosted on a regular basis,\" said Dr. Peter Hotez, an infectious disease expert at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas. Hotez led a team that developed a Covid vaccine based on protein technology that is authorized in India. About 76% of people ages 12 and older have received their first two vaccine doses in the U.S., according to CDC data. About 50% of those individuals have received their first booster dose. For adults ages 18 and older, three doses of Pfizer's or Moderna's original vaccines were 55% effective at preventing hospitalization from the omicron BA.2 subvariant four months after the third shot, according to CDC data. Three shots were 19% effective at preventing infection from omicron five months after the third shot, according to CDC data from August 2021 through May 2022. The rapidly spreading BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants have since driven omicron BA.2 out of circulation. Dr. Peter Marks, head of the FDA office responsible for reviewing vaccines, said the hope is that the updated boosters will restore the high level of protection against disease that vaccines demonstrated when they were first authorized in December 2020. \"We don't know for a fact yet whether we will get to that same level, but that is the goal here. And that is what we believe the evidence that we've seen helps point to,\" Marks told reporters during a news conference after the authorization Wednesday. The Biden administration moved rapidly over the summer to get updated shots ready for the fall. Public health officials are worried the U.S. is on the verge of another wave of infection as more transmissible omicron variants spread, immunity from the original vaccines wears off, and people head indoors to escape colder weather. Pfizer and Moderna were originally developing boosters to target omicron BA.1, the variant that caused the massive wave of infection last winter. But the FDA told the vaccine makers in late June to switch gears and target BA.4 and BA.5 instead as those variants quickly gained ground. The sudden change in plans left little time for clinical trials in humans before a fall rollout. As a consequence, the authorization is based on human clinical trials from the BA.1 shots, which produced a better immune response than the original doses, according to the FDA. But it's unclear how the BA.5 boosters will perform in humans since the data is based on BA.1. Marks said it will likely be at least another two months before human clinical data on the BA.5 shots is made available to the public. The most common side effects from the human trials of the BA.1 shots was pain, redness, swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headaches, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea, vomiting and fever, according to the FDA. The Covid vaccines also have a well-established safety profile after administration to millions of people over the course of the pandemic, the FDA said. In addition to human data from the BA.1 shots, the authorization was also based on animal studies from the BA.5 boosters, Marks said. In June, Pfizer also presented data to the FDA's independent vaccine advisory committee that showed the bivalent omicron BA.5 shots increased antibodies in mice that protect against infection by about 2.6-fold compared with the original vaccine. Marks said the FDA used the same process for the authorization that it relied on in the past for switching the strains in flu vaccines. \"We're pretty confident that or what we have is very similar to the situation that we've done in the past with influenza changes where we don't do clinical studies for them in the United States,\" Marks said. \"We know from the way the vaccine works, and from the data that we have, that we can predict how well the vaccine will be working.\" But some infectious disease and vaccine experts say the FDA should have waited for human data from the BA.5 shots before authorizing them. Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA's advisory committee, said data based on mice studies is not sufficient to justify authorizing the new boosters. \"You have to show some evidence in people that the immune response that you're getting with the bivalent vaccine is clearly better, and those data haven't been presented,\" said Offit, an infectious disease and vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \"You can't ask millions of people to get this booster dose without showing some human data that you have a dramatic increase in neutralizing antibodies to the BA.4/BA.5 strains as compared to boosting with the ancestral type,\" Offit said, referring to the currently authorized shots based on the version of Covid that emerged in China, more than two years ago. Michael Osterholm, a leading epidemiologist and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, also said more data needs to be presented on how the BA.5 shots perform in humans. \"It's not that I don't think it could work,\" Osterholm said. \"But I think we need the data first to show that the immune response to this vaccine is equivalent to or better than what we have already.\" But CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, in a radio interview, said waiting longer for human data from the BA.5 shots could mean the boosters become outdated if a new variant emerges. Walensky said the change in the vaccine formula is small and should not affect safety. \"There's always a question here of being too slow versus too fast,\" Walensky told \"Conversations on Health Care\" in a radio interview. \"One of the challenges is if we wait for those data to emerge in human data [...] we will be using what I would consider to be a potentially outdated vaccine.\""},

According to Orsted, it has a capacity of more than 1.3 gigawatts and stretches across an area of 462 square kilometers \u2014 more than half the size of New York City. Hornsea 2, it added, uses Siemens Gamesa turbines with blades measuring 81 meters, or more than 265 feet. \"One revolution of the wind turbine blades can power an average UK home for 24 hours,\" the company says. It is the latest step forward for the Hornsea 2 project, which generated its first power in Dec. 2021. The development comes as European countries attempt to wean themselves off Russian fossil fuels, including gas, following the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine in February. \"Current global events highlight more than ever the importance of landmark renewable energy projects like Hornsea 2, helping the UK increase the security and resilience of its energy supply and drive down costs for consumers by reducing dependence on expensive fossil fuels,\" said Duncan Clark, head of the U.K. region at Orsted. The U.K. is home to a mature offshore wind sector that looks set to expand in the coming years, with authorities aiming for up to 50 GW of capacity by 2030. The European Union, which the U.K. left in January 2020, has previously laid out a 300 GW target for offshore wind by the middle of this century. Across the Atlantic, the U.S. has a long way to go to catch up with Europe. America's first offshore wind facility, the 30 megawatt Block Island Wind Farm, only started commercial operations in late 2016.

Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina is set to start operations in 2025, with the firm stating that total investment in the plant will now amount to $3.8 billion. Norm Bafunno, who is senior vice president, unit manufacturing and engineering at Toyota Motor North America, said the announcement marked \"another significant milestone\" for the business. The additional investment in the U.S. is part of a wider investment of up to $5.6 billion in battery production, with Toyota noting that demand for battery electric vehicles was growing. To this end, the business said it would aim to ramp up \"combined battery production capacity\" in the U.S. and Japan by as much as 40 gigawatt hours. As well as diesel and gasoline vehicles, Toyota is known for its hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell offerings. It is also attempting to make headway in the increasingly competitive battery-electric market, where firms like Tesla and Volkswagen are jostling for position. This has not been without its challenges. In June 2022, Toyota issued a safety recall for more than 2,000 of its all-electric SUV, the bZ4X. Toyota may be looking to invest billions in EV battery production, but on Wednesday the business stressed it would also \"continue to make every effort to flexibly meet the needs\" of customers \"in all countries and regions by offering multiple powertrains and providing as many options as possible.\" Indeed, the website of Toyota Europe states that the \"internal combustion engine continues to be the most popular means of powering vehicles and it will continue to play a role for the next 20 to 30 years.\" All the above comes at a time when major economies are laying out plans to reduce the environmental footprint of road-based transportation. Just this month, the California Air Resources Board approved a rule that will require all new car sales in the state to be zero emission by the year 2035. Elsewhere, the U.K. wants to stop the sale of new diesel and gasoline cars and vans by 2030. It will require, from 2035, all new cars and vans to have zero-tailpipe emissions. The European Union \u2014 which the U.K. left on Jan. 31, 2020 \u2014 is pursuing similar targets. According to the International Energy Agency, electric vehicle sales hit 6.6 million in 2021. In the first quarter of 2022, EV sales came to 2 million, a 75% increase compared to the first three months of 2021."},

Explaining its decision, the company \u2014 one of several in England and Wales to have announced water usage limits in recent weeks \u2014 said extreme temperatures and this summer's heatwave had resulted in the highest demand for water in more than 25 years. \"The driest July since 1885, the hottest temperatures on record, and the River Thames reaching its lowest level since 2005 have led to a drop in reservoir levels in the Thames Valley and London,\" it said. The TUB does not apply to businesses, although Thames Water said it was asking those within its area \"to be mindful of the drought and to use water wisely.\" This could involve companies switching off water features on their premises and not washing their vehicles, it suggested. \"Implementing a Temporary Use Ban for our customers has been a very difficult decision to make and one which we have not taken lightly,\" Sarah Bentley, the Thames Water CEO, said. \"After months of below average rainfall and the recent extreme temperatures in July and August, water resources in our region are depleted,\" Bentley added. The announcement of the ban comes at a time when many water companies are facing criticism related to leaks from their pipes. For its part, Thames Water said it had teams focused on locating and fixing more than 1,100 leaks per week. When it comes to enforcement of the ban, the firm said it hoped and expected customers to continue using water wisely. \"If we become aware of customers ignoring the restrictions, we'll contact them to make sure they're aware of the rules and how to use water responsibly and wisely,\" it added. \"There are criminal offences for those that repeatedly ignore requests to comply with the ban.\" Last month saw temperatures in the U.K. surge, with highs of over 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) recorded for the first time ever. On Aug. 12, the U.K.'s Environment Agency announced that parts of England had moved into drought status. \"In drought affected areas the public and businesses should be very mindful of the pressures on water resources and should use water wisely,\" authorities said. They added that government expected water firms \"to act to reduce leakage and fix leaking pipes as quickly as possible and take wider action alongside government policy.\" The U.K. is not alone when it comes to drought-related issues. On July 18, the European Commission's Joint Research Centre published a report looking at drought in Europe. \"The severe drought affecting several regions of Europe since the beginning of the year continues expanding and worsening,\" it said. \"Dry conditions are related to a wide and persistent lack of precipitation combined with early heatwaves in May and June.\" In an interview with CNBC earlier this week, Bill Hare, CEO and senior scientist at research non-profit Climate Analytics, explained how the current conditions were having wide-ranging effects. \"On the water supply, it's clear that in the U.K. and other parts of Europe, we're seeing already very significant water stress that's beginning to affect \u2026 ordinary urban residents, not just farmers,\" he said. \"We're seeing the lack of availability for cooling water for thermal, nuclear or coal power stations, which is causing curtailment of power,\" Hare, who was speaking to CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche, said. \"This is a problem we're seeing all over the world,\" he added. \"We're seeing, also, issues for example in Germany, now in the Danube region, with low water flow, meaning you can't carry cargo anymore.\" This was in turn, \"having big implications not just for the transport of energy, but for agriculture, all manner of industrial commodities and so on.\""}
