The sister of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was speaking at the Global Supertrends Conference 2022 on Wednesday. The Web3 is a hypothetical, future version of the internet based on blockchain technology \u2014 an \"ideal utopia,\" said Zuckerberg. \"But \u2026 that's not what's happening. What's happening in reality, is chaos.\" The founder and CEO of Zuckerberg Media, a production company and marketing consultancy, added, \"You're the only one watching your own back and your own assets, people are spending time protecting themselves by setting up so many different wallets and protecting their identity and that's not contributing to development in the area.\" Zuckerberg, who was an early employee at Meta \u2014 formerly known as Facebook \u2014 explained that various metaverses are now acting as \"their own walled garden,\" in which users are unable to use their assets across platforms. The metaverse can be loosely defined as a virtual world where people live, work and play. With cryptocurrency, users can buy and develop virtual land or dress their own avatars. \"Right now, I'm on Decentraland, my son is on Roblox, my other son is on Fortnite. That's great \u2014 we're all in the metaverse. [But] we have no interaction with one another,\" she said. \"In order to really unlock the potential [of Web3], we're going to need to figure out a system where there's interoperability. What you have goes with you wherever you are, [and] we're not there yet,\" Zuckerberg added. However, according to Zuckerberg, that's easier said than done because no company running a metaverse right now wants to give up control or \"share that ownership.\" \"That's why it's not we're not seeing that kind of consumer mainstream adoption yet because there needs to be a world where you leave the house with one wallet. And you need to see that same behavior online also.\" She added that Web3 needs experts who have been involved in the global banking system and Web2 \u2014 the internet that we know today \u2014 to lend a \"protective layer.\" The need for such experts is all the more important because it has been \"too easy\" for users to be scammed or lose all their assets in Web3, said Zuckerberg. \"There needs to be more protections for consumers \u2026 I think we will wind up [with] web 2.7, where there is some centralization, keeping people safe, but the ability to port your assets with you to any site.\" Another thing that needs to be improved in Web3 is user-friendliness, she added. \"It should not take 45 steps to set up a cryptocurrency wallet, buy a currency and enter the metaverse. It needs to [be] one-stop, beginner-friendly.\" The metaverse may still be in its infancy, but Zuckerberg pointed out that sectors like real estate will be \"extremely valuable.\" \"Wherever there's scarcity \u2026 there's value. I think the big question will just be, is there scarcity in the metaverse and if there is, there will be value in real estate there,\" she added. According to data from MetaMetrics Solutions, real estate sales in the metaverse surpassed $500 million in 2021 and could double in 2022. Zuckerberg said that education and training will be another \"huge area\" for opportunities and revenue. \"Especially in this new age where workers are remote, it is very difficult to upskill remote workers \u2026 I think training in the metaverse, education in an interactive way, is going to become crucial for every business that has a remote work,\" she added. \"We're really just scratching the surface of what we're going to see.\""},

He was speaking at the 2022 Global Supertrends Conference. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced in May that the country will take firm steps to restart idled nuclear power plants to stabilize energy supply and prices. In 2011, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami, which killed nearly 16,000 people and caused the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986. Though there have been reservations among the Japanese public over the use of nuclear energy, particularly when it comes to the issue of safety, Tanaka said the future of nuclear power is now safer, and stressed the importance of minimizing risk and maintaining \"peaceful use.\" Tanaka attributed the increase in public support to the possibility of \"serious problems by the end of this year\" if Japan does not have nuclear power. He added that Russia supplies 9% of Japan's natural gas, and losing that supply could spell trouble for the country as it would have to turn to alternative sources, which would lead to a spike in energy prices. Japan has repeatedly criticized Russian aggression in Ukraine and has slapped Moscow with economic sanctions. In response, Russia sanctioned over 300 Japanese lawmakers in July. Russia recently cut gas supplies to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to just a fifth of its capacity. Moscow has repeatedly denied it is weaponizing fossil fuel supplies over the Russia-Ukraine war. Tanaka said that Japan wants to secure energy supplies but also work toward reaching carbon neutrality by 2050, and striking that balance could prove increasingly challenging. Nuclear power has been touted as an important option for decarbonization.\n\"Japan is trying to secure the supply of energy, especially electricity, while trying to maintain the targets of carbon neutral by 2050 intact. So this is really (a) challenge for Japan to do many things,\" he said."},

In a recent note, Charles Dumas, chief economist at U.K.-based investment research firm TS Lombard, said that action on climate change is often criticized as moving too slowly. However, with governments increasing spending to aid their post-Covid economies, they may start catching up. A key tenet of this is the ever-decreasing cost of electricity per megawatt hour, according to figures from TS Lombard, with costs of solar, offshore and onshore wind dropping over the last 10 years, while gas and coal have remained largely the same. \"Effectively by 2030 the cost of renewable electricity is going to be half that of coal and gas sourced electricity,\" Dumas told CNBC. These trends will bring many of the various pledges to reach net zero more closely in sight. The fatal floods in Germany in recent weeks have put the impacts of climate change firmly in the spotlight again but they are only the latest in a series of devastating extreme weather events of late, including the sprawling wildfires in Oregon. Amid this backdrop, the United Nations Climate Change Conference, better known as COP26, will meet in Glasgow in November. It will mark one of the most significant multilateral meetings on climate since the Paris agreement. Dumas said that as COP26 approaches, governments need to understand their key priorities, and among them should be infrastructure investments as numerous technological and engineering challenges continue to obstruct renewable energy. \"I think the intermittency problem is pretty serious and it's not just that the sun goes down at night,\" Dumas said. In the case of solar power, output can be mixed depending on the location of infrastructure like solar farms. \"There's huge variation with sunny days in winter and sunny days in the middle of summer so the intermittency takes on a very big seasonal aspect,\" Dumas said. \"You can have vicious weather for a long time in the middle of December or January and lo and behold you wouldn't want to be depending on solar power.\" Energy transmission could be another bottleneck, he said. While the developing world, including several African nations, has great potential in developing sites for generating solar power, that power needs to move easily. \"The issue of transmission technology is really major. If you want Chad to be the new Saudi Arabia, because of the Sahara Desert there's a lot of sun there, but you want the electricity to be used in Europe then you're talking about some expensive processes and processes needing a lot of research and a lot of further investment.\" Storage and carbon capture are all areas that require hefty investment, Dumas added, if governments are to reach their net-zero targets. \"What we need is a very clear public policy lead in order to get anywhere near these net zero promises and I suspect that actually what it's going to be about is a carbon tax, which the Americans may resist but will be necessary,\" he said. Paul Steele, chief economist at an independent policy research institute called the International Institute for Environment and Development, said that climate action and renewable energy investments will serve the dual purpose of tackling the climate crisis while creating jobs for the post-Covid economy. \"One of the priorities coming out of Covid is to create labor intensive employment. Both in developed and developing countries, you can provide labor intensive employment through renewable energy,\" Steele said. One example, he said, was the retrofitting of boilers in homes in the U.K., which would help push the country toward its climate targets and create new jobs while being relatively inexpensive in the grand scheme of things. Steele said that investments to drive a climate-friendly economy cannot be short term or have quick goals. He pointed to the various government support schemes for the airline industry, which has been battered by the pandemic. Just this week, the European courts gave the nod to a $2.9 billion bailout for Air France-KLM's Dutch business. Bailout funds like these should be tied to sustainability commitments by the airline industry, he said, but that can be a dicey proposition to get over the line. \"Governments aren't making the connections enough and traditionally treasuries and particularly the ministries of transport are still dominated by road building lobbies and people who like to build highways and increase transport rather than people who want to invest in sustainable alternatives.\"  "},
{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/10/india-australia-singapore-firms-jobs-are-in-these-sectors-linkedin.html", "title": "Australia, India and Singapore companies are still hiring. Here's where the jobs are", "paragraphs": " Recession fears may be looming in Asia-Pacific, but that hasn't stopped companies in India, Australia and Singapore from continuing their hiring spree, according to LinkedIn. As economies reopened after the pandemic, companies in the hospitality, retail and entertainment sectors ramped up hiring, said Feon Ang, Asia-Pacific managing director at the professional networking platform. All three countries saw an increase in job postings on LinkedIn for jobs in the accommodation sector, such as hotels, motels, casino hotels and bed-and-breakfast inns. According to data collected by LinkedIn, paid job postings for careers in Australia, India and Singapore increased in June compared to a year ago, with the following sectors seeing the most growth: 1. Accommodation, up 62%\n2. Retail jobs, up 46%\n3. Financial services, up 25% 1. Accommodation, up 65%\n2. Construction, up 40%\n3. Real estate and equipment rental services, up 25% 1. Accommodation, up 15%\n2. Transport and logistics, up 31%\n3. Entertainment providers (businesses involved in performances, events, and exhibitions), up 100% However, jobs in Singapore's health care, education and construction industries were all down by more than 30%, according to LinkedIn. Ang noted that the cutback of job postings for Singapore's construction sector was likely due to measures introduced by the government to cool the private and residential property market. Although there's an increase in hiring rates across the three countries, there was less competition among job seekers in June compared to one year ago, LinkedIn data showed. On average, there was a more than a 50% drop in applications for paid job postings on LinkedIn in Australia, India and Singapore \"Even as job postings rise, workers are being more selective in picking their next role, and so competition for jobs on average is down,\" said Ang. \"This means that workers are in a position to demand more out of work, and have higher expectations of what they want in a job \u2013 and that's a healthy sign,\" she added. In both Australia and Singapore, paid job postings that offered remote work options fell. Paid listings in Australia fell by 8% in June compared to a year ago, although sentiment for flexible working arrangements was still strong. Opportunities that offered remote working options received two times more applications on average, according to LinkedIn. In Singapore, paid job postings that allowed employees to work from home fell from 8% in the first quarter to 6.7% in the second quarter. But unlike employees in Australia, LinkedIn observed that interest in flexible working arrangements seemed to be waning in Singapore. Employers in India felt differently, according to the data. Paid job postings in the South Asian country which offered remote work options remained relatively constant throughout the year and there wasn't particularly more interest in jobs with remote options. \"Postings with remote options received only 1.1x more applications on average relative to their absolute share of all job postings in both quarters,\" said LinkedIn."},

Here\u2019s what it costs \u2014 and how they pay for it", "paragraphs": " Ernestas Tyminas felt \"stuck\" in his role as a marketing manager at a newspaper in Colorado Springs, Colorado. So he requested two months off to backpack through Asia, he said, landing in Beijing in January 2019. \"On the first day \u2026 I meet this one,\" he said, gesturing to Darina Karpitskaya, sitting by his side. The couple, speaking to CNBC via video from Dubai, said they met via the travel app Couchsurfing, which links solo travelers together. Karpitskaya, 31, and a flight attendant at the time, had been grounded in Beijing for two days because of mechanical problems with her return flight. Though more solo travelers agreed to meet that day, Tyminas and Karpitskaya were the only two who showed up. After one day together, they planned to meet again in Asia one month later. Karpitskaya returned to Asia, and the couple's second date was a \"crazy one-month adventure\" to Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines, said Tyminas, 29. It was in the Philippines, he said, that he decided he wasn't going back to his old life. \"We were \u2026 laying on the beach under the stars,\" he said. \"We were kind of starting to dream about this lifestyle.\" After returning to Colorado, Tyminas quit his job, sold his belongings and moved to Europe, he said. Karpitskaya wasn't quite there yet, saying, \"At first it sounded like: Oh my God, you're quitting your job. You're moving from America. Maybe it's too soon. But at the same time, when I came back from that trip I felt like I'm living a life that I'm not enjoying.\" Tyminas flew from Denver to Paris with his dog \u2014 an 82-pound Borzoi, once known as the \"Russian Wolfhound,\" named Cosmo, who is over 6 feet tall on his hind legs. \"They gave me three rows of seats, and the dog was just laying on the floor,\" he said. From there, the couple traveled often \u2014 to places like Italy and Iceland \u2014 but not yet full time, they said. Then Karpitskaya got what she called her \"dream job\" \u2014 a position with Emirates airline. She moved to Dubai, but the couple continued to meet and travel together. Then Covid hit, and Karpitskaya accepted four months of unpaid leave from her job. \"We said: We have four months \u2014 we can go explore whatever is open,\" said Tyminas. The trio \u2014 including Cosmo, who traveled in a huge bed in the back of their SUV \u2014 traveled first to Croatia, then slowly across much of Europe, including many former Soviet states, said Karpitskaya. She never returned to her job, and couple have been traveling ever since, she said. In the beginning, they spent between $1,000 and $2,000 a month \u2014 all from savings \u2014 by staying in cheap accommodations, cooking at home and seeking out free activities, said Tyminas. As money started to dry up, Tyminas took several online jobs, which netted between $2,000 and $3,000 a month, which wasn't far from his salary of $3,300 in Colorado, he said. But the work was cumbersome, and it \"felt like I still had a job,\" he said. So the couple decided to open a marketing and graphic design company, despite the fact that \"we didn't know a lot,\" said Tyminas. They reached out to thousands of people, they said, often working late into the night. Potential customers would ask, \"Can you design book covers?\" \"Can you promote music?\" Tyminas said his response was always the same, \"Of course I can.\" In reality, he was learning on the job, he said, relying on YouTube, Google and online research. But clients were very happy, he said. \"They paid me half of what they would pay other marketing agencies and the results, they said, were better than they had before,\" said Tyminas. In the first month, the couple made $6,000, he said. Now, sometimes they earn several thousand dollars in a day working with real estate companies and music labels, he added. \"We write blogs for people \u2014 we do everything,\" said Tyminas. Plus \"we don't have to report to anybody. We're our own bosses.\" In the past six months, the couple said they spent an average of $4,000 a month. More than half goes to accommodations, which vary by location \u2014 from $3,100 per month in Dubai to $1,500 in Lisbon, Portugal, they said. They limit stays in expensive locations, like Switzerland, to no more than a week, they said. One way to save money is booking monthlong stays on Airbnb, which cuts down average nightly rates and reduces service and cleaning fees, said Tyminas. But even when they bounced from place to place to visit Europe's Christmas markets last year, they still ended up paying about $2,500 that month, he said. Karpitskaya said she doesn't want these costs to scare people because they spent far less in the beginning. At the time, they spent about 80-100% of their income, but now Tyminas said \"we spend about 30% and \u2026 save the rest.\" The couple told CNBC they still travel modestly \u2014 no five-star hotels \u2014 and they still cook most meals at home. But they spend more on activities that they film for their YouTube channel Dream Team Travels \u2014 another \"completely self-taught\" venture, they said. A life of constant travel isn't all fun and games, they said. They encounter dirty Airbnbs and hosts who cancel reservations at the last minute. They've also had their camera equipment and clothing stolen twice \u2014 once in Mexico, and more recently in France \u2014 plus an attempted theft of their belongings from their car in Barcelona, while they were sitting in it. They have also thought about settling down when they find a place they really love, such as the beaches of Portugal or the French Riviera, said Tyminas. \"But then \u2026 we drive somewhere else and we're like this place is also just as good,\" he said. When Russia invaded Ukraine, quickly occupying the Kherson region where Karpitskaya's parents live, Tyminas emailed CNBC to say that they'd stopped traveling for the time being. \"The first few weeks we didn't even leave our apartment,\" he said. \"We spent a lot of time arranging transportation for civilians as well as many dogs from shelters to be taken out of dangerous regions for adoption in Europe.\" By the summer, they had resumed traveling, but were still helping to evacuate Karpitskaya's family. \"Just a week ago we were able to finally get Darina's parents out of Ukraine,\" said Tyminas, adding that they are currently in his family's home in Lithuania. \"We also did a trip to Romania to pick up Darina's sister and her five-month-old baby from the border and took her to live in Germany.\" The couple are now in Malaysia, they said, and plan to explore Southeast Asia for the next two months."},

The world's biggest long-haul carrier will be retrofitting over 120 aircraft with new interiors, as well as dishing up menus with new vegan options and cinema snacks like popcorn, Emirates said in a statement.\nOther new perks for the carrier's first-class travelers include unlimited portions of Persian caviar, paired with Dom Perignon vintage champagne. Those investments come just as Emirates posted a $1.1 billion loss for the year ended March 31. \"While others respond to industry pressures with cost cuts, Emirates is flying against the grain and investing to deliver ever better experiences to our customers,\" said the president of Emirates airline, Tim Clark. Emirates is not the only airline pulling out all the stops to ride the tailwinds of \"revenge travel\" \u2014 the idea that people are making up for time \"lost\" during the pandemic to travel again. Earlier this year, Finnair launched a new line of premium economy cabins, featuring seats that provide around 50% more space than their economy seats. Air France, likewise, announced new long-haul business seats in May, complete with sliding dividers for passengers who want their own private space.\nEmirates told CNBC that it has seen \"a lot of interest\" in these luxury upgrades, though it said it does not have the full numbers yet. The upgrades come on the heels of an industry report predicting that business travel spending will return to pre-pandemic levels in 2026 rather than 2024, as previously forecast. Though spending by business travelers has been on the upswing, the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) annual report stated that the 2021 figure was still less than half of the over $1.4 trillion that was generated by in business travel in 2019. One travel analytics company, however, noted a shift in demand toward premium seats. \"During the pandemic, we saw that the numbers of people travelling by air collapsed. However, the proportion of travelers flying in premium cabins increased significantly,\" Olivier Ponti of ForwardKeys told CNBC in an email.\nPonti said that before the pandemic, the split between premium and economy seats was a ratio of 13:87, compared with 17:83 in 2022.\n\"While there's no guarantee that the shift towards premium seats will be maintained as air travel recovers, one can understand why the airlines would want to invest in keeping hold of premium passengers, who, this year have typically spent 575% more on a seat than those flying economy.\" Others are skeptical, however. Edward Russell, an editor at Skift, a travel industry news site, told CNBC it's unclear how much of an effect \"small\" product changes will have on sales. \"Most travelers either fly the airline, or alliance, where they have loyalty, or opt for the cheapest fare. It is only a small subset of travelers who will actually book a flight based on the addition of a sliding door or unlimited caviar.\""},

A new study compared prices to find out", "paragraphs": " Many travelers try to save money by searching the internet for cheaper hotel rates. But a new study suggests it may not be worth the time \u2014 at least in some places. The travel insurance comparison site InsureMyTrip compared rates for 950 hotels in 19 global cities on three popular booking websites as well as each hotel's site. According to the results published last week, Hotels.com had the best overall rates \u2014 but just barely. Hotels.com had the best rates in 620 instances, which was slightly higher than Expedia, which had the cheapest rates in 579 instances. Booking directly with a hotel was more expensive, but by only about $6 more on average, according to the study. \"There have been conflicting views on hotel rates, and people ... believe that booking through online travel platforms ensured a better rate than the hotel website,\" said Shalabh Arora, director of marketing at India's Four Seasons Hotel Bengaluru. \"However, it's not so at Four Seasons where rate parity is taken very seriously.\" He said the hotels' website has a pop-up function which compares rates offered by the hotel with those on other booking platforms. Finally, the website Booking.com had the cheapest rates in 72 instances \u2014 or about 7% of the time \u2014 according to the study. \"Not only was [Booking.com] rarely the most affordable, but it was also the most expensive option the majority of the time,\" according to the published results. The company's Managing Director for Asia Pacific Laura Houldsworth responded to the study by email, stating that the company aims \"to always be transparent with our customers\" and that \"our property partners are free to set their own prices on Booking.com.\" She added that \"our promise to price match also means that if a customer should ever find a lower price on another website, Booking.com will refund the difference.\" The report found average hotel rates on Hotels.com and Expedia were the same in seven of 19 cities, with overall averages varying by just 27 cents. \"Expedia and Hotels.com often had the same price, especially with the international hotels,\" said Sarah Webber, director of marketing for InsureMyTrip. Both brands are owned by Expedia Group, which also operates other travel booking websites, including Travelocity, Hotwire, Orbitz and CheapTickets. \"Hotels working with Expedia Group distribute their rates across all of our brands,\" said Anna Brown, a company public relations manager. \"The rate is similar across brands, however various offers ... approved by our hotel partners, sometimes create rate differences.\" Brown said rates can also vary through brands' app-only pricing, while Hotwire's \"Hot Rates\" mask hotels' names prior to purchase in exchange for deep discounts on last-minute bookings. Booking.com is part of Booking Holdings, which operates Priceline, Agoda and Kayak. Booking Holdings had the highest revenue among all online travel agencies from 2019 to 2021, according to the research company Statista. The InsureMyTrip report showed significant rate differences in certain cities. For instance, travelers could save as much as $88 per night in Honolulu, if they found the lowest price. In New York, the report found average hotel rates varied from $293 on Hotels.com to $367 on Booking.com. The study also found: But rate fluctuations were less pronounced outside of the United States. Posted rates varied less than $10 per night on average in Hong Kong, Bangkok, Macau, Kuala Lumpur and Istanbul, according to the research. InsureMyTrip's study represents a snapshot in time, with the research analyzing rates for a double room for two people booked for the night of Aug. 27, 2022, the firm said. All searches were conducted on the same day to avoid price fluctuations, since \"prices can change quickly and without warning,\" said Webber. However, the study did not consider whether rates were refundable or included taxes, said Webber. \"To keep the study as simple as possible, we took the price seen on the sites as the final cost,\" she said. \"So, it's definitely something to consider as not all hotels or booking sites include the same extras in the final price.\" Other factors, such as prepayment requirements and breakfast inclusions, can affect rates too, which further complicates the hotel price comparison process \u2014 for researchers and travelers alike."},

Here are their stories. Job: Emmy-award winning TV host of \" Samantha Brown's Places to Love\"\nStarted in: Comedy \" I went to Syracuse University for musical theater because I so desperately wanted to move to New York City and become a thespian. I wanted to do Shakespeare and be on Broadway. That didn't pan out. I waited on tables for a good eight years. But I loved improv, and I was a part of an improv comedy troupe. So I just kept auditioning for jobs. A writer recommended me to a production company that was \u2026 looking for a host. But my audition for it had to be totally improvised. That's how I got the job. When you are a travel host, there's no script. Yet it is still up to you to define the scene, to understand the trajectory of a story and how to end it. Also in improv, the golden rule is to never say no, it's always yes \u2014 to keep things going. Waiting on tables in New York City for eight years, you start to be really humbled, [but] those were the tools that I had that got me a job that I never in my wildest dreams thought I would ever have.\" Job: Creator of \" Strictly Dumpling\" and other YouTube channels (total: about 8 million subscribers)\nStarted in: Accounting and wedding videography \"I moved to the U.S. from China when I was 8 years old. My parents started working in restaurants, and eventually started their own very Americanized Chinese restaurant. So I grew up on a steady diet of General Tso's chicken and crab rangoon. There wasn't a lot of diversity where I'm from, but it helped that my parents sent me back to China when I was 13. Most people get grounded and sent to their room as a punishment \u2014 I got sent to China for two years. That's when I was like: Wow, it's so amazing \u2014 the people, the history \u2014 I want to know more. After college, I went to New York and worked on Wall Street for a year. Then I became a wedding videographer because I wanted to be flexible. I was living in a small basement apartment in Brooklyn with no air conditioning, making about $400 \u2014 on a good week. But this was the first time I was eating something that wasn't Red Lobster and Olive Garden. I got a taste of diverse ethnic food in Chinatown, and I started to discover a lot of my heritage that I never really saw as important before. I started recording food videos on YouTube as a food diary for myself. I remember having a conversation with a friend that food content will never amount to anything. There wasn't anybody online doing it. I had like 10 subscribers. Somehow it grew to this, which was never expected. I never really had much money growing up \u2014 or throughout most of my adulthood. So I was always looking for things that were inexpensive but also really filling and delicious. And that's pretty much what I do around the world now.\" Job: Television host of \" Family Travel with Colleen Kelly\"\nStarted in: Sales \"I tried out for the broadcast school at the University of Texas. The school gave you one chance to be accepted into the program. I had never sat at an anchor desk with a camera pointed at me. I failed miserably. Several years later, I graduated and got my first job in sales, eventually moving to Chicago and working in the pharmaceutical industry. The money was amazing, and I had a company car. But I wasn't living my dream, and this started to really bother me. In my early 30s, I got married and eventually quit my job to be a stay-at-home mom. One day, when my two little girls were in school, I went to our town hall's cable TV station and asked if, in exchange for teaching me how to edit, I could host the local entertainment show about our village \u2014 something like \"Access Hollywood\" for our 50,000-resident town. Because they had no other offers, they said yes. I acted confident, but I was as green as they come. I was shaking in my boots every time I did an interview and read voice-over, but I was gaining experience and knowledge. I confided in another mom that my dream was to host a national travel show, and, surprisingly, she agreed to produce it with me. We wrote a script, found a local camera guy for a few dollars and made a pilot. I took meetings with two major companies \u2014 both said no. I was told by one network that women don't watch travel shows, so the concept of family travel didn't appeal to them. I then sent thousands of emails to television stations. Nothing worked. Finally, my mother suggested I call the local PBS station. I googled the head of programming, called him (no emails) and got a meeting. After more meetings, we learned PBS was picking two shows to go national, and \"Family Travel with Colleen Kelly\" was one of them. We scraped by for a year, producing 13 episodes that first season. Now, the show has been on for more than 10 years. And, the best part is that I can bring my family with me. It's been a long and arduous journey, but I hope this story inspires others to believe in themselves, ignore the naysayers, and never give up on their dream.\" Editor's note: These interviews have been edited for length and clarity."},

The decision contradicts a 2019 ruling over dress code policies at Walmart that allowed the retail titan to limit (but not ban) employees from wearing pro-union insignia at work. Two members of the labor board dissented on the Tesla ruling, while three moved to overrule the prior Walmart decision. The majority wrote, \"when an employer interferes in any way with its employees' right to display union insignia, the employer must prove special circumstances that justify its interference.\" Tesla did not demonstrate special circumstances that justified its policy, the NLRB decided. Tesla had previously argued before the NLRB that its dress code was meant to prevent workers' clothing from \"causing mutilations\" to the cars or car seats they were building, and to help managers \"easily determine that employees are in their assigned work areas,\" of the company's factory. Former Tesla employees had testified before the NLRB that management at Tesla made them remove T-shirts with United Auto Workers union messages and logos on them, even though they posed no risk of damaging cars or car seats. The UAW and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday. Previously, the NLRB ruled that Tesla CEO Elon Musk violated labor laws when he suggested in a tweet that Tesla workers would need to give up their stock options if they unionized.

The local government approvals allow Baidu's Apollo Go robotaxi business to eliminate the cost of human personnel in some instances. The initial scale of the permits is small: 10 robotaxis divided between two suburban areas of Wuhan and Chongqing, two major Chinese cities. In April, Baidu and rival robotaxi operator Pony.ai received approval from a Beijing suburban district to operate robotaxis without a human driver. But the Chinese capital still requires human staff to sit in the robotaxi with passengers. Municipal authorities across China have issued an increasing number of permits in the last year that allow robotaxi companies to operate and charge fares in selected areas. In the U.S., Alphabet's Waymo and General Motors ' subsidiary Cruise can already run public robotaxis with no human staff in the vehicles. Laws for testing robotaxis and charging riders vary by city and state. Baidu claimed it has received more than one million orders for robotaxi rides. In the first three months of the year, the company said it operated 196,000 rides. Baidu is set to release second quarter results on Aug. 30."},

Google said the app lacks effective systems for moderating user-generated content, which violates the store's terms of service. \"On Aug. 19, we notified Truth Social of several violations of standard policies in their current app submission and reiterated that having effective systems for moderating user-generated content is a condition of our terms of service for any app to go live on Google Play,\" the tech company, which is owned by Alphabet, told CNBC in a statement Tuesday. Axios first reported the Google statement. The restriction means that Android users, who make up 44% of smartphone users in the U.S., can't download the app. Google will not let the app go live until the content issues are addressed. Truth Social acknowledged Google's concerns and said it would work on addressing these issues, according to Axios. Trump Media and Technology Group CEO Devin Nunes told a different story. The former lawmaker, who was one of former President Donald Trump's staunchest allies in Congress, said the decision is up to Google and not dependent on Truth Social's policies. \"When are we going to be available on Android? Well, look, that's up to the Google Play store. We're waiting on them to approve us, I don't know what's taking so long,\" Nunes said on the \"Just the News Not Noise\" podcast. \"It sure would be nice if they would approve us.\" Google said that Nunes' statements misrepresent the ongoing dialogue between Trump Media and the Play store. Google reiterated that Truth Social's violations, and the steps to redress them, have been clearly communicated with the company. Trump Media pushed back, saying Truth Social was creating a \"vibrant, family-friendly environment.\" \"TMTG has no desire to litigate its business matters in the public sphere, but for the record, has promptly responded to all inquiries from Google,\" the company said in a press release Tuesday. \"It is our belief that all Americans should have access to Truth Social no matter what devices they use. We look forward to Google approving Truth Social at their earliest convenience.\" Trump Media and Technology Group made the app available for preorder on Android in early August. It is available on Apple's App Store. Google's YouTube has suspended Trump's channel. Android users can still access Truth Social through the platform's website. The restriction is one of several obstacles faced by the former president's app. Truth Social was created as a \"free-speech\" alternative to Twitter, after Trump was banned from the platform for his tweets relating to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Hundreds of the president's supporters stormed the building that day to try to block Congress from confirming Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election. Trump, who had about 88 million followers on Twitter, has about 4 million followers on Truth Social, where he continues to push false claims about the election. He is facing a criminal investigation over secret government records he took with him to his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida and is considering another run for the White House. Trump Media was set to go public through a merger with Digital World Acquisition Corporation, a special-purpose acquisition company. The deadline is Sept. 8, although DWAC is pushing for a delay of up to a year. DWAC warned shareholders that a decline in the former president's popularity could hurt the app and that, without a delay, the acquisition company may have to liquidate. DWAC scheduled a shareholder meeting for Sept. 6, two days before the current merger deadline. Shares of the company were down more than 2% Tuesday at $24.65, far from their peak of about $97 in March."},

The Japanese gaming giant launched PlayStation Studios Mobile Division on Monday and said it will run independently of the console business. Sony also said on Monday it acquired Helsinki- and Berlin-based mobile game developer Savage Game Studios. The move comes after a tough second quarter for Sony's gaming division, and the company's downgrading of its full-year profit forecast for the business as the Covid-induced boom \u2014 during which people were stuck at home playing video games \u2014 begins to fade. Sony also continues to face supply chain issues and cannot meet the demand for its flagship PlayStation 5 console. Sony has dominated the console market for several years, thanks to the PlayStation. But the company is now looking to diversify. This year, the Japanese gaming giant said it plans to release around 50% of games on PC and mobile by 2025, up from about a quarter currently. \"For that to happen, Sony needs to make big bets on mobile gaming,\" Serkan Toto, CEO of Tokyo-based game industry consultancy Kantan Games, told CNBC. And the opportunity is big. Consoles account for about 27% of the $196.8 billion games market, whereas mobile makes up more than half of revenues, according to Newzoo. The purchase of Savage Game Studios continues Sony's recent acquisition drive as it looks to boost the development of titles across platforms. \"PlayStation Studios must continue to expand and diversify our offering beyond console, bringing incredible new games to more people than ever before,\" said Hermen Hulst, head of PlayStation studios. \"Acquiring the talented team at Savage Game Studios is another strategic step towards that goal.\" Sony said that Savage Game Studios is working on an \"unannounced new AAA mobile live service action game.\" A \"triple A\" game is an informal industry classification usually for a blockbuster type of title. A live service game is usually a title where developers continually update and add content to extend its lifetime and generate revenue over a longer period of time. The success of Call of Duty Mobile and Diablo Immortal on mobile, both of which were originally designed for console and PC, show there is demand for well-known titles on smaller screens \"if executed well,\" according to Daniel Ahmad, senior analyst at Niko Partners. Sony's mobile strategy is likely to lean on its massive library of intellectual property (IP) but also with a focus on developing specific games for smaller devices, Kantan Games' Toto said. \"Sony is very likely to not only bring existing PlayStation IPs to mobile but also encourage studios to develop new franchises for smart devices from scratch,\" Toto said. Sony is the latest console maker to make a big step into mobile gaming. Microsoft's Xbox gaming unit has also begun making early moves into mobile. Nintendo has, for the last three years, also been focusing a lot of effort on the smaller screen gaming format. Globally, Sony will compete with companies it hadn't really before, particularly Chinese giants Tencent and NetEase \u2014 two of the world's largest mobile gaming players. But Toto said Sony's chances of success are still high. \"The mobile gaming market is overcrowded. There are over 1 million games in app stores nowadays. But players such as Sony, even if they are new entrants, can still make it just because of their fire power,\" Toto told CNBC. \"There are not many companies like Sony out there, with such strong branding, a whole range of high-performing studios and a treasure trove of valuable IPs.\""},
{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/29/apple-iphone-14-event-preview-september-2022.html", "title": "Expect Apple to show four new iPhones and an updated Apple Watch next week", "paragraphs": " Apple is holding a launch event at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, on Sept. 7. The company is expected to announce new iPhone models, as it has every September since 2012. Apple has used prerecorded videos for its launch events since early 2020 thanks partly to Covid restrictions, and this will be the first iPhone launch with an in-person component since 2019. Apple is streaming the launch event online on its website and YouTube in addition to inviting some media to its campus. Apple's hype-filled fall launches are a signature event for Apple. They typically draw millions of simultaneous viewers on YouTube. They garner attention from around the world and set the stage for a holiday marketing blitz during the last three months of the year, which is when Apple's sales are the highest. This year's event has the tagline \"far out,\" which could refer to features such as night-sky photography. Last year, Apple released new iPhones and Apple Watches at an event in September, and then followed it up with an October launch featuring iPads and Macs. Here's what Apple is likely to launch next Wednesday, based on reports. Apple is expected to release four new iPhone models. If Apple's current naming convention holds up, they will be called the iPhone 14. This year Apple will likely discontinue the \"mini\" model with a 4.7-inch screen, according to reports. Instead, Apple could offer two sizes, one with a 6.1-inch screen and one with a 6.7-inch screen, each coming in a standard model and a pricier \"Pro\" model. The Pro models are expected to get more upgrades, according to reports from Bloomberg News, TFI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, and other analysts and Apple watchers. Since 2017, iPhones have included a space at the top of the phone's display with space for Apple's FaceID system, which includes several sensors and a camera. The Pro models could ditch Apple's \"notch\" where it houses the FaceID camera for a slimmer, more streamlined \"pill\" or \"cutout\" approach with a smaller space that has to remain blank, leaving room for an even larger display. The Pro models are also expected to get upgraded A16 processors and cameras. The camera bump is expected to get larger. Apple could release an always-on screen display for showing notifications, like some Android phones have sported for years. Beta iPhone software released over the summer suggested that Apple may be planning a similar feature because of new widgets that show weather and battery life. One of the biggest questions is how Apple will price its iPhones in a period of inflation around the world and macroeconomic uncertainty in some regions. Other consumer electronics, such as Sony's Playstation 5, have seen price cuts. Apple's least-expensive iPhone 13 model is the $699 iPhone 13 Mini, which is expected to be discontinued. That would make Apple's mainline device, which is currently the iPhone 13, the least-expensive new model at $829, if its price doesn't change. Some analysts also expect Apple to increase the price of its Pro models. Apple usually drops the price of older models when it releases new ones, giving more price-sensitive consumers an option. Apple is likely to show the eighth major new version of its watch next week. Last year, the Apple Watch Series 7 got a slightly larger screen, but the redesign did not significantly change the look and feel of the device, which has remained mostly the same since 2014. Expect more evolution this year, too. Apple is considering a body temperature sensor in the new devices, according to the Wall Street Journal, which could help with fertility and sleep tracking. Other sleep tracking features could include the ability to detect advanced sleep patterns or apnea. But the biggest Apple Watch Series 8 announcement could be a new \"Pro\" model with a bigger screen and more durable finish. Apple has previously released Apple Watches with pricey case materials such as gold, ceramic and titanium, and the new \"Pro\" model described by Bloomberg and Kuo could be one of the first high-end Apple Watches to gain additional features over its less-expensive siblings. Also likely: A new updated version of the Apple Watch SE, its $329 entry-level Watch model. IPhone owners who don't plan to buy any new gear this fall will still get an annual update to the iPhones software, iOS 16, which was announced in June and has been in testing over the summer. The software has several new features that users will immediately notice. The biggest banner feature is the ability to customize the iPhone's lock screen with widgets that can display weather forecasts, calendar appointments and other information at a glance. Users can also change the font for the lock screen clock for the first time, as well. IOS 16 also lets you unsend or edit iMessage text messages, as long as you catch them within a few minutes of sending. IOS 16 will also introduce short-term loans from Apple called Apple Pay Later. The feature will allow users to buy stuff online with Apple Pay but pay for the item in four installments without paying interest. One cool feature in iOS 16 is if a user has both an iPhone and a Mac laptop or desktop, they can use the iPhone as a very high-definition web camera. Apple is unlikely to release new iPads next week because their software isn't ready yet. Earlier this month, Apple told TechCrunch that iPadOS, the iPad software, will ship after iOS this fall, suggesting a staggered release. Apple's statement was terse, and the company dislikes talking about unannounced products. But in general, it likes to release new hardware together with new software, so the statement clearly suggested that new iPads would come at a later launch date than iPhones. IPadOS and iOS are very similar, but this year iPadOS is getting a feature called Stage Manager that could allow users to multitask more efficiently \u2014 but also got panned by early testers. Improved iPads could include more powerful processors that are closers to laptop processors, smoother displays and better integration with accessories. Apple also uncharacteristically teased a new \"Mac Pro\" in the spring. The Mac Pro is currently a $5,000 tower of power using an Intel processor. Apple wants to transition its entire Mac lineup away from Intel to its own M-series processors, but a pricey niche product doesn't fit as well with Apple's mass-market iPhones and Apple Watches. Instead, new Macs could be announced at a separate event later this year, as happened last year."},

The company will invest up to $1 billion in the new factory, which it plans to build in the Southeast of the U.S. The newly announced plant will be the panel maker's fourth fully integrated U.S. factory. First Solar also said Tuesday that it will spend $185 million upgrading and expanding its existing facilities in Ohio. CEO Mark Widmar pointed to the IRA as the key catalyst that made the company decide to build another factory in the U.S. rather than looking elsewhere. The funding packages create, for the first time, a \"long-term view and understanding of the industry, and policies aligned to that industry,\" he told CNBC. \"With that level of clarity, we stepped back and evaluated the alternatives or the options of where we could go with our next factory and when we looked at it comprehensively the U.S. was a very attractive option,\" he said. Widmar added that this is the first time the entire supply chain has been incentivized, from the manufacturer to the generating asset and finally to the end customer. \"With that type of alignment, you can create partnerships and opportunities to grow together collectively and more of a win-win type of structure than maybe we had before the implementation of the IRA,\" he said. First Solar said the new factory will manufacture 3.5 gigawatts of solar modules annually by 2025, with the company's Ohio facilities posting cumulative annual production capacity of over 7 GW by 2025. By comparison, the U.S. added 3.9 GW of solar capacity during the first quarter of 2022, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. The country's total solar industry now stands at 126.1 GW, which is enough to power 22 million homes, according to SEIA. Shares of First Solar have surged 65% since the end of July when Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V. announced their surprise agreement on the climate, health care and tax bill. The legislation, which swiftly passed the House and Senate and was signed into law by President Joe Biden, benefits First Solar in several ways, including through the production tax credit for domestic manufacturers. First Solar is the largest U.S.-based developer of solar panels, with a focus on utility-scale panels. The factory announcement comes as First Solar struggles to keep pace with booming demand. During its second quarter earnings call, First Solar said it's sold out through 2025, with a backlog of 44 GW. Widmar said First Solar wants to move quickly when building out its new factory. One of the company's considerations is a site that's as close to shovel-ready as possible. Other factors include the type and availability of workers in the area. First Solar is aiming to have identified the site by the end of the current quarter. \"I think the industry is in the best position it ever has been\u2026for growth beyond any expectations that anyone would have envisioned,\" Widmar said."},

The decision will affect flights by Xiamen, Air China, China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines from Sept. 5 to Sept. 28. The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) cited the recent cancellation of 26 American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines flights over Covid-19 cases. The suspensions include 19 China-bound flights from Los Angeles and 7 China Eastern flights from New York. The Chinese Embassy in Washington's spokesperson Liu Pengyu said the USDOT action was \"extremely irresponsible\" and \"groundlessly suspended Chinese airline flights.\" The embassy said China's Covid-19 \"circuit breaker\" measures were fair and transparent, applied both to Chinese and foreign airlines and were consistent with bilateral air transportation agreements. USDOT said as of Aug. 7 Chinese authorities had revised their policies so if the number of passengers on a flight to China testing positive for Covid-19 reached 4% of the total, one flight would be suspended. If it reached 8%, two flights would be suspended. USDOT said the U.S. has repeatedly raised objections with China, saying the rules place \"undue culpability on carriers\" when travelers test negative before boarding their flight from the United States only to \"test positive for Covid-19 after their arrival in China.\" Beijing and Washington have sparred over air services since the start of the pandemic. In January, the Transportation Department suspended 44 China-bound flights from the United States by the four Chinese carriers in response to China's decision suspend 44 flights by U.S. carriers. In August 2021, USDOT limited four flights from Chinese carriers to 40% passenger capacity for four weeks after Beijing imposed identical limits on four United Airlines flights. Three U.S. airlines and four Chinese carriers typically operate about 20 flights a week between the countries, well below the figure of more than 100 a week before the pandemic."},

In its Q2 investor letter on July 21, Snap said it would not provide guidance for its current quarter and said \"forward-looking visibility remains incredibly challenging.\" Snap shares dropped more than 25% on the day it reported its second quarter earnings. The company's disappointing results kickstarted a wave of social media companies reporting poor results, citing a weak online advertising market, among other reasons. Facebook-parent Meta also missed analysts' estimates for its second quarter, as did Pinterest. The social media companies blamed some of their problems on businesses cutting back on digital advertising because of the weak economy. Additionally, these companies have said that a 2021 privacy update to Apple's iOS has made it more difficult for them to track users, thus negatively impacting their online ad units.

Mark Kelly in November's election, according to people familiar with the matter. Masters has received urgent private calls in recent weeks from GOP leaders like Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, these people explained. The NRSC is the official campaign arm for the Senate GOP, and has spent over $6 million taking on Masters' rival Kelly, according to data from the nonpartisan OpenSecrets. Kelly's seat has long been considered a potential pickup opportunity for Republicans, as forecaster Cook Political Report labels the race a toss-up. Recent polling, however, suggests that Masters is falling behind. A Fox News poll taken in August shows Kelly leading Masters by 8 points, while an Arizona Republican pollster told NBC News that his own surveys showed Masters trailing Kelly by 10 points. Longtime GOP megadonors, who want to help Masters overtake Kelly but have not heard from him since he won the party's primary, have inundated the Republican candidate with calls, these people explained. A person familiar with one of the recent calls to Masters said a veteran GOP financier \"read him the riot act\" and told him, in part, that he must start raising money from more wealthy Republican donors and stop relying on billionaire tech executive Peter Thiel, his longtime colleague and friend, to help him like he did in the primary. These people declined to be named in order to speak freely about private conversations. Shortly after publication of this story, Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for the Masters campaign, denied that the candidate ever heard from a GOP megadonor who \"read him the riot act.\" Miller told CNBC in an email: \"It didn't happen.\" Kelly has massively outraised Masters, who won a Republican primary in Arizona this month. The incumbent's campaign has amassed more than $54 million during the 2022 election cycle, compared with just over $4 million for Masters' campaign, according to the latest Federal Election Commission data. Thiel contributed $15 million during the primary to a pro-Masters super PAC, Saving Arizona, and he donated $1.5 million to the committee as recently as July. Masters was the chief operating officer at Thiel Capital, an investment firm founded by Thiel. The calls to Masters come as even some Republican leaders seem to be questioning their Senate candidates. When asked about his predictions for the midterms, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said\"candidate quality\" has a lot to do with winning Senate elections. He added that he believes there will be an \"extremely close Senate\" after November's elections. The Senate is currently split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans. In a statement to CNBC, NRSC spokesman Chris Hartline did not deny that Scott called Masters to urge him to improve his fundraising operation. \"Mark Kelly votes with Joe Biden almost 100% of the time. While he claims to be a moderate, he's supported reckless Washington spending and done nothing to address the border crisis that's raging in Arizona. The NRSC will continue to remind Arizona voters of Mark Kelly's radical agenda and Blake Masters' plans to fight for Arizona families,\" Hartline said in response to questions about Scott's contact with Masters. Data from ad tracker AdImpact shows that the NRSC has booked just over $3.8 million in ads in Arizona for September, but nothing yet for October or November. The ad tracker also shows that Masters' campaign has not yet booked airtime for the fall while Kelly's team has reserved over $10 million in ad space from September through November. AdImpact says it has not yet seen data showing the Thiel-backed Saving Arizona reserve airtime for the fall. The last spending it saw from the super PAC was on Aug. 2, the day of the Arizona Senate Republican primary. The super PAC spent over $10 million during the primary, including almost $8.5 million backing Masters, according to OpenSecrets. Masters and his campaign did not return requests for comment. A spokesman for Saving Arizona did not return requests for comment. Thiel and his spokesman did not return requests for comment, including about whether the billionaire GOP donor plans to help Masters further. The candidates and outside groups from both sides of the aisle have combined to spend over $90 million in the general election Senate race in Arizona. Yet Democratic organizations appear to be outspending their Republican rivals in the Grand Canyon State on ads in the coming months. AdImpact's data shows Democratic outside groups are reserving nearly $28 million worth of ad time in Arizona over the next three months. Republican committees have so far spent just over $16 million on ad buys within the same time span trying to help Masters overtake Kelly, according to the data."},

The 15 boxes included 184 specific documents marked classified, 67 of which were marked \"confidential,\" 92 marked \"secret\" and 25 documents marked \"top secret,\" according to the affidavit. \"Based upon this investigation, I do not believe that any spaces within the PREMISES have been authorized for the storage of classified information at least since the end of FPOTUS 's Presidential Administration on January 20, 2021,\" the agent wrote in the affidavit. Of the 32 pages of the affidavit, 21 pages are almost totally or significantly blacked out. The search warrant itself was revealed voluntarily by the DOJ less than a week after the Aug. 8 raid. The warrant indicated that FBI agents were looking for materials showing violations of laws against obstruction of justice and the removal of official records, as well as the U.S. Espionage Act. The FBI took at least 20 boxes of items in the August raid, including numerous sets of highly classified documents, according to a property receipt that was also made public by the DOJ. In a social media post after the redacted affidavit was released, Trump accused the FBI and DOJ of \"public relations subterfuge\" by the fact that the word \"Nuclear\" did not appear in the document \u2014 though he also noted that it was \"heavily redacted!!!\" The affidavit did not detail the specific content of documents it expected to find. Trump also lashed out at Reinhart, arguing that he should have recused himself from this matter because he had previously removed himself from another case involving the former president. The reason for that recusal was not clear, news outlets reported, but Trump claimed it was \"based on his animosity and hatred of your favorite President, me.\" The government argued last week against releasing the affidavit, even in a redacted form. \"The redactions necessary to mitigate harms to the integrity of the investigation would be so extensive as to render the remaining unsealed text devoid of meaningful content,\" read a court filing from Jay Bratt, head of the counterintelligence and export control section of the DOJ's National Security Division. Bratt also argued that the affidavit \"would serve as a roadmap to the government's ongoing investigation\" if disclosed. Reinhart disagreed, and ordered the government to propose redactions to U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach, Florida, by Thursday. The judge accepted the DOJ's redactions later that day. The government said last week that the Mar-a-Lago raid is part of a probe that \"implicates national security\" and is still in its \"early stages.\" Trump, who first revealed the FBI's search of his Florida residence, has cast himself as the victim of a political attack by the Biden administration that was carried out against the presumptive Republican front-runner in the 2024 presidential race. The former president on Monday sued the government, asking a federal judge to block the DOJ from poring over the documents seized from Mar-a-Lago until a court-appointed third party reviews them. \"The political Hacks and Thugs had no right under the Presidential Records Act to storm Mar-a-Lago and steal everything in sight, including Passports and privileged documents,\" Trump said in a social media post earlier Friday morning.

A few states quickly followed through. Idaho sold $300,000 of bonds in a Russian oil company in early March. A day before the invasion, the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System sold its shares in the Russian bank Sberbank. But those examples are outliers. Six months into a war that has killed thousands of Ukrainians and displaced over 12 million more, most of the pledges to drop Russian investments \u2014 some made with great fanfare during news conferences \u2014 have gone unfulfilled, according to an Associated Press review, state retirement administrators and firms that invest state funds. Swift global reaction has cut off much of Russia's economy from the rest of the world. That has made it nearly impossible for divestment by state pension funds, university endowments and other public-sector holdings \u2014 as well as private investments such as those in 401(k) accounts. \"These pension funds want to get out, but it's just not realistic to sell everything in the current environment,\" said Keith Brainard, research director at the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. Benjamin Smith, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island treasury, said the factors that make it hard to divest also show that a worldwide effort to isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin is working. \"This is good news because it means that pressure from investors across the world, including Rhode Island, is succeeding in exacting a toll on the Russian economy, making it more difficult for Putin to fund his military operation, state-owned companies, and corrupt network of oligarchs,\" he said in an email, noting that Rhode Island's pension plan exposure in Russia never exceeded 0.3% of its assets. Any pre-war investments in Russia are now worthless, or nearly so. That's raising questions from some officials and fund managers about whether divesting is even necessary. In Hawaii, one of a handful of states where top administration officials did not pledge to divest, Gov. David Ige said at a May 5 news conference that the state's employee pension system had \"very little to almost nothing\" invested in Russia. \"The few remaining investments are quite small, and so I didn't feel compelled to just make a statement for political reasons that we would be divesting,\" he said. Before Russia's invasion in late February, many government-controlled investments had only small holdings \u2014 a fraction of 1% in every reported case \u2014 in Russian investments. But even that could amount to millions of dollars. The largest U.S. public-sector retirement fund, California's CalPERS, said just 17 cents of every $100 of its portfolio was in Russian investments as the war broke out. Even so, that translated into $765 million worth of stocks, real estate and private equity. By the end of June, the value had shrunk to $194 million. The entire loss was because the holdings dropped in value; none had been sold. There is no way to know how much state government entities in the U.S. have invested in Russia or companies based there, but collectively they were worth billions of dollars before the war. Much of the money was invested in Russian government bonds, oil and coal companies as part of emerging-markets index funds. Quick to condemn the invasion, state officials said they could put pressure on Putin by dumping their Russian investments. \"Our moral imperative before these atrocities demand that you act to address Russia's aggressions and immediately restrict Russian access to California's capital and investments,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote in a letter on Feb. 28 to the boards overseeing the massive pension funds that serve teachers, state and local government workers and university employees. Across the country, governors and other top officials made similar statements. Just after the invasion began, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed an executive order calling for divestment \"to the extent possible,\" while Arizona's Board of Regents voted to exit any Russian investments. The treasurers for 36 states plus the District of Columbia and U.S. Virgin Islands signed a joint letter in March advocating divestment of publicly controlled funds from Russia. They noted a financial reason for doing so: \"The current crisis also constitutes a substantial risk for states' investments and our economic security.\" A major chunk of the government holdings in Russia is in the form of index funds that investors use to mimic overall stock market performance. Russian stocks were commonly part of funds specializing in emerging markets. MCSI and other firms that decide which stocks should be in the funds quickly dropped Russian securities. But the companies that sell investment products based on those indexes were left in the lurch, still leaving pieces of Russian stocks in their investors' portfolios. As part of the sanctions, stock markets in the U.S. and elsewhere stopped the trading of Russian stocks. And the Moscow Stock Exchange was closed for nearly a month, reopening with tight controls that keep U.S. investors from selling. The assets sank in value amid the invasion, though the precise value isn't always clear. Maryland said that as of the beginning of February, $197 million of its state retirement and pension system funds were invested in Russian assets. A month later, the state estimated the value had plunged and amounted to just $32 million. The state has been unable to unload its investments. For the handful of states in which top officials have not endorsed divestment, eroding values like that are the main reason. Shortly after the invasion, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said the number of state investments in Russia was \"minuscule\" and noted that the value was about to \"shrink to almost nothing as the Russian economy is being virtually shut off from the world.\" In Florida, Lamar Taylor, the interim executive director of the agency that oversees investments of pension funds, said during a cabinet meeting that some investment managers might seek to unload Russian assets as soon as they're able, while others could hold on in case they're worth more later. At the meeting, Gov. Ron DeSantis said the State Board of Administration has a legal responsibility to try to make money for the retirement system. \"That would violate your fiduciary duty, if you liquidated at massive losses for political reasons rather than for the best interests of the beneficiaries,\" he said. But DeSantis said there was a way to make it easier: Lawmakers passing a bill banning investment in Russia. \"If the Legislature could speak clearly, that would be something we'd welcome here, just to make sure we're not furthering investments in parts of the world that are not reflective of our interests or values,\" he said. Hank Kim, executive director of the National Conference on Public Employee Retirement Systems, said he has told member pension funds that taking steps to divest is important even if it can't be completed right away. \"The public has a right to know that it was debated in a serious manner,\" he said."},

The former TV personality's vocal support for the energy business follows years of industry donations to his nonprofit and then his campaign, according to financial records reviewed by CNBC. Oz also has a personal stake in oil and gas through investments in two major energy companies, according to his financial disclosures. Pennsylvania's next senator will be a key vote for the energy industry, as it has a major presence in the Keystone State. Pennsylvania is the nation's second-largest natural gas producer after Texas and the third-largest coal producer, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Oz backed the energy industry this year as Americans felt the strain from spiking gas prices. In a recent interview, he ripped President Joe Biden after he called on companies that run gas stations to bring down prices at the pump. \"Now, they're blaming the energy companies for the gas prices. And I'm thinking, like most Americans, what are you talking about? I mean, you did things that make it, make it impossible for these companies to exist,\" Oz said in a July interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity. He called Biden's comments \"class warfare.\" As Oz champions oil and gas in his bid to represent Pennsylvania in the Senate, both his campaign and personal coffers have benefited from the industry and its executives. Oz, a veteran physician and television host, is running against Democrat John Fetterman for a Senate seat being vacated by Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. Oz is trailing Fetterman by just under 8 percentage points in an average of recent polls, according to RealClearPolitics. Fetterman's campaign has raised over $25 million, while Oz and his team have brought in just over $18 million, according to data from the nonpartisan OpenSecrets. Oz and his wife, Lisa, have a financial stake in the industry he has championed, as they own shares of oil and gas giants ConocoPhillips and Pioneer Natural Resources, according to their financial disclosure report. The filing notes they own shares of ConocoPhillips valued between $15,001 and $50,000 and Pioneer stock valued between $1,001 and $15,000. Oz's connections to the industry formed before he pursued politics. His nonprofit HealthCorps, which promotes itself as a group aiming to help teens with their health and wellness, has seen at least $210,000 in contributions from gas and oil producer Continental Resources since 2016, according to the group's annual financial reports. Continental's support has continued into Oz's Senate bid: The company's founder and chair, Harold Hamm, endorsed Oz for Senate in an April campaign video. The backing from energy industry leaders has led to contributions to Oz's campaign. Hamm is among a group of over a dozen oil and gas industry leaders who have combined to contribute over $200,000 to Oz's campaign since he announced his run for Senate late last year, according to a CNBC review of Federal Election Commission filings. Others with ties to the oil and gas business who have donated at least $2,900 to Oz's campaign include Jimmy Haslam, an owner of the Cleveland Browns and chair of Pilot Company, a business that owns fueling stations across the country. His father and Pilot founder, James Haslam II, also donated to the Oz campaign. Other top energy donors in recent months include Brad Cox, the chair of oil producer Cox Operating, and Janet Cafaro, the president of Silcor Oilfield Services, FEC records show. Jimmy Haslam and his wife, Susan \"Dee\" Haslam, combined to give $50,000 to the pro-Oz super PAC American Leadership Action. Jimmy and Dee Haslam told CNBC in a statement that they have \"tremendous respect for the long, successful career Dr. Oz has had in the private sector and appreciate that he now wants to serve his country by bringing his expertise and experience to the United States Senate.\" The Haslam family, as of 2015, had a net worth of $6 billion, according to Forbes. Representatives for Cox and Cafaro did not return requests for comment. Hamm told CNBC in a statement that he considers Oz a \"friend.\" He said the two have known each other for almost a decade, with the goal of bringing HealthCorps' services into Oklahoma schools. Hamm explained that he believes Oz will be a key advocate for the energy sector, which has enriched the oil billionaire. He and his family have a net worth of at least $21 billion, according to Forbes. \"Dr. Oz will champion American energy in the U.S. Senate much like he's championed health his entire career,\" Hamm said. The nonprofit's annual reports from 2016 through 2020 give a range of how much donors contributed to HealthCorps. Continental Resources regularly ranked among the Oz group's top backers. The company is often listed as donating between $50,000 and $99,999 during those years. A HealthCorps filing says it received a range of $10,000 to just under $25,000 from Continental in 2018. In its earlier filings before 2016, HealthCorps lists Continental as either a \"national\" or a \"community\" sponsor. The group's website notes that its national sponsors contribute $1 million and its community donors write checks for $250,000. The disclosures pre-2016 do not say or show a range of how much the company gave those years. Oz's support from the massive energy industry coincides with an apparent shift in his opinion on fracking, which allows companies to drill deep into the earth for oil and gas resources. Critics say that fracking hurts the environment by harming water supplies and polluting the air. Before Oz ran for Senate, he repeatedly wrote columns that took aim at fracking, noting its potential threat to public health, Vice reports. \"And in Pennsylvania, there are multiple reports of air and water contamination, possibly from hydraulic fracturing sites, causing folks breathing problems, rashes, headaches, nosebleeds, numbness, nausea and vomiting,\" Oz said in a 2014 column critical of fracking. Brittany Yanick, a spokeswoman for the Oz campaign, said the candidate has not changed his view on fracking and is a strong supporter of the drilling method. She also took aim at Fetterman's position on the issue. \"As a scientist, Dr. Oz understands that, like with COVID, the Biden administration is ignoring the science and the benefits of natural gas in order to satisfy the radical Left, the same liberal Democrats that are supporting radical environmental measures and funding John Fetterman's campaign,\" Yanick said in an emailed statement. \"John Fetterman has called fracking a 'stain' on Pennsylvania, he's called for a moratorium on fracking, and he would be a rubber stamp for the failing Biden Agenda.\" Fetterman has a mixed history with where he stands on fracking. Inside Climate News reported that Fetterman dropped his support for a fracking moratorium after his failed 2016 primary run for Senate. His position evolved after the state moved toward stricter regulations on fracking. Emilia Rowland, a spokeswoman for Fetterman's campaign, told CNBC that \"John does not support a ban on fracking in Pennsylvania and that includes a moratorium on new fracking sites.\" She said he hasn't taken any campaign money from the fossil fuel industry. \"John believes fully heartedly that we have to preserve the union way of life for the thousands of workers currently employed by the natural gas industry in Pennsylvania and the communities where they live. We can't just abandon these people, and tell them to go learn how to code,\" Rowland said in a statement. \"It's a total false choice that we have to choose between jobs and a clean environment. That's just not true. We can have both.\" Still, Oz appears more vocal than Fetterman in publicly supporting the oil and gas industry. In a recent op-ed, he said it's \"gross, and deeply unpatriotic\" for oil companies to charge high gas prices while their businesses are making massive profits. Fetterman namechecked Chevron, Exxon and Shell in the op-ed. Oz has rubbed elbows with industry officials during his campaign. He was invited to a June \"energy industry meet and greet\" by longtime lobbyist Missy Edwards. The invite says the meeting was set to take place at Edwards' offices in Washington. Her current clients include Southern Company and General Motors, OpenSecrets says. A spokeswoman for General Motors said she was \"not sure if GM had a representative in attendance.\" Edwards and a representative for Southern Company did not return requests for comment."},

The funds sent back to the SBA were obtained via the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program using both fabricated information and stolen identities. The suspects used Green Dot Bank, a fintech institution, to hold and move the fraudulent funds. More than 15,000 accounts were used in the conspiracy, by individuals in the U.S. as well as domestic and transnational organized crime rings, the agency said. Investigations are ongoing and further information about suspects was not immediately released. The investigation was initiated by the Secret Service field office in Orlando, Florida, and Green Dot bank worked with the agency to identify the fraudulent accounts. \"Fraudsters in general are always looking for ways and techniques to better do their crimes and modern conveniences are just one of those things they use. So currently, cryptocurrency is a big thing, fintechs, third-party payment systems. But there's not an institution, even our traditional financial institutions, that weren't targeted during the pandemic,\" Roy Dotson, lead investigator for the Secret Service, told CNBC in an interview. Initial investigations indicated the majority of the fraudulent accounts at Green Dot were established with synthetic and stolen identities, and involved using \"willing and unwilling money mules,\" Dotson said. The Secret Service and SBA Office of Inspector General put out advisories to 30,000 financial institutions in early 2020 to lay out fraud indicators and guide the banks to partner with federal agencies to recover fraudulent funds, Dotson said. He added these investigations will likely last years due to their size and scope. Green Dot said it has partnered with federal agencies including the Secret Service to identify fraud in the industry. \"Account protection and fraud prevention are top priorities for us, and we work around the clock and invest heavily to identify, block and address fraudulent activity. We're committed to protecting customers, and also to serving as [a] proactive ally to government agencies and industry peers as we work together to prevent fraud,\" Green Dot spokeswoman Alison Lubert said in a statement. OIG Inspector General Hannibal Ware said the partnership with the Secret Service has to date resulted in more than 400 indictments and nearly 300 convictions related to pandemic fraud. The U.S. government allocated more than $1 trillion to Main Street under both the Paycheck Protection Program and EIDL program. The PPP allowed small businesses to borrow loans that may be forgiven if the borrower used the majority of the capital on payroll, while the Covid-19 EIDL program allowed borrowers to access loans based on temporary losses of revenue due to the pandemic. An advance grant was also available under the EIDL. Reviews of the two programs by the SBA's Office of Inspector General warned that criminals would potentially exploit the system due to the fast-moving nature of the rollout and demand for aid. CNBC investigations revealed, in some cases, how easy it was for criminals to obtain fraudulent aid via stolen identities. The SBA OIG said it has identified $87 billion of potentially fraudulent EIDL loans. Over the past two years, the Secret Service said it has seized over $1.4 billion in fraudulently obtained funds and assisted in returning some $2.3 billion to state unemployment insurance programs. Nearly 4,000 pandemic-related fraud investigations and inquiries have been initiated by the Secret Service. More than 150 field offices and 40 cyber task forces are involved. \"This is not going to be a quick fix. As we talked about today, 15,325 accounts at one financial institution \u2014 this is one case, so you can just think of the potential number of suspects and how many investigations that could come out of those. And with all of our federal, state and local partners working this and having the same mission. It's going to be a long process,\" Dotson said at a news conference announcing the returned funds."},

The Justice Department argued in a court filing that Trump lacks the legal standing to appoint a special master. Appointing that watchdog could harm national security, the agency warned. The department also said it has evidence that government records likely were concealed and removed from a storage room at Trump's home at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, \"and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation.\" Trump had sued to block the Justice Department from further investigating any materials taken in the raid until a court-appointed special master is able to analyze them. That step is typically taken when there is a chance that some evidence should be withheld from prosecutors because of various legal privileges. \"As an initial matter, the former President lacks standing to seek judicial relief or oversight as to Presidential records because those records do not belong to him,\" the DOJ wrote to Judge Aileen Cannon in U.S. District Court in southern Florida. Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, has set a hearing for Thursday at 1 p.m. ET in a West Palm Beach courthouse. Trump's legal team has until Wednesday night to reply to the DOJ's latest submission. The DOJ is conducting a criminal investigation of the removal of White House documents and their shipment to Trump's residence at Mar-a-Lago when he left office. By law, presidential records must be turned over to the National Archives and Records Administration when a president departs office. The National Archives and Records Administration retrieved 15 boxes of records from Mar-a-Lago in January. The next month, NARA sent a referral to the DOJ that the records contained \"highly classified documents intermingled with other records,\" according to the affidavit used to obtain the warrant for the Aug. 8 search of Trump's home. The DOJ said in Tuesday night's filing that the FBI had \"uncovered multiple sources of evidence indicating ... that classified documents remained\" at Mar-a-Lago. \"The government also developed evidence that government records were likely concealed and removed from the Storage Room and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation,\" the DOJ wrote. That evidence contradicted a sworn certification letter on June 3 from the custodian of Trump's records, claiming that \"any and all\" documents responsive to a grand jury subpoena had been handed over, the DOJ wrote. The August search \"cast serious doubt on the claim in the certification ... that there had been 'a diligent search' for records responsive to the grand jury subpoena,\" according to the DOJ's filing. Of the evidence taken in that raid, \"over one hundred unique documents with classification markings \u2014 that is, more than twice the amount produced on June 3, 2022, in response to the grand jury subpoena \u2014 were seized,\" the DOJ wrote. \"That the FBI, in a matter of hours, recovered twice as many documents with classification markings as the 'diligent search' that the former President's counsel and other representatives had weeks to perform calls into serious question the representations made in the June 3 certification and casts doubt on the extent of cooperation in this matter,\" the DOJ wrote. The prosecutors also argued against the appointment of a special master, saying it is \"unnecessary\" and that doing so \"would significantly harm important governmental interests, including national security interests.\" That harm could include impeding the intelligence community's \"ongoing review of the national security risk\" that may have been caused by \"improper storage of these highly sensitive materials,\" the DOJ argued. The prosecutors concluded that Cannon should reject Trump's requests \"and decline to require the return of seized items, enjoin further review of seized materials, or appoint a special master.\" Tuesday's filing came one day after the DOJ told Cannon that its review of the seized materials was complete. The DOJ told the court on Monday that a law enforcement team had identified a \"limited set\" of materials that may be protected by attorney-client privilege. That privilege often refers to the legal doctrine that protects the confidentiality of communications between an attorney and their client. The so-called privilege review team \u2014 which is separate from the investigation that led the FBI to search Trump's residence earlier this month \u2014 is following a process to \"address potential privilege disputes, if any,\" the DOJ wrote. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence \"is also leading an intelligence community assessment of the potential risk to national security that would result from the disclosure of these materials,\" according to the filing. Before the DOJ posted its late-night response, a group of former government officials asked the judge to let them file a brief as \"amici curiae\" \u2014 Latin for \"friends of the court\" \u2014 arguing against Trump's requests. The group included six former federal prosecutors who served in Republican administrations, as well as former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who governed as a Republican but backed President Joe Biden over Trump in 2020."},

The \"limited set\" of potentially privileged information was identified by a team that is kept separate from the investigative squad that searched Trump's Palm Beach, Florida, residence earlier this month, DOJ officials said in a court filing in U.S. District Court in southern Florida on Monday morning. The so-called privilege review team \"completed its review of those materials\" and is following a process to \"address potential privilege disputes, if any,\" according to that filing. Attorney-client privilege often refers to the legal doctrine that protects the confidentiality of communications between an attorney and their client.

The agency disclosed the privilege team's review one week after Trump sued to block the DOJ from further investigating any materials taken in the raid until a court-appointed \"special master\" is able to analyze them. Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, gave notice Saturday of her \"preliminary intent to appoint a special master\" in the case. Cannon ordered the government to publicly respond to Trump by Tuesday. She also ordered the DOJ to submit a sealed filing that provides more details about the seized materials, and she set a hearing for Thursday at 1 p.m. ET in a West Palm Beach courthouse. In response, top DOJ counterintelligence official Jay Bratt assured the judge that the government will comply with those orders. But \"the government notes that, before the Court issued its Preliminary Order, and in accordance with the judicially authorized search warrant's provisions, the Privilege Review Team ... identified a limited set of materials that potentially contain attorney-client privileged information\" and \"completed its review of those materials,\" Bratt wrote. The DOJ and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, or ODNI, \"are currently facilitating a classification review of materials recovered\" from Trump's residence, Bratt added. The ODNI \"is also leading an intelligence community assessment of the potential risk to national security that would result from the disclosure of these materials,\" he wrote. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to answer reporters' specific questions about the DOJ probe later Monday, stressing that the agency is conducting its investigation independently and \"we have not been involved.\" She noted, however, neither President Joe Biden nor anyone else at the White House has been briefed on the matter, but declined to comment on any classified materials prepared for the president. Trump's civil lawsuit is being overseen by a different judge than the one who approved the search warrant for Mar-a-Lago. The affidavit for that search warrant \u2014 in which an FBI agent explained why the government had probable cause to believe the search would turn up evidence of illegality \u2014 was released Friday, albeit with heavy redactions. The National Archives and Records Administration retrieved 15 boxes of records from Mar-a-Lago in January. The next month, NARA sent a referral to the DOJ that the records contained \"highly classified documents intermingled with other records,\" according to the affidavit. By law, presidential records must be turned over to the National Archives when a president departs office. The FBI launched a criminal investigation and found that the 15 boxes included 184 specific documents marked classified, 67 of which were marked \"confidential,\" 92 marked \"secret\" and 25 marked \"top secret,\" according to the affidavit. The search warrant was revealed days after the FBI entered Mar-a-Lago in August. It indicated that FBI agents were looking for materials showing violations of laws against obstruction of justice and the removal of official records, as well as the U.S. Espionage Act. The FBI took at least 20 boxes of items in the August raid, including numerous sets of highly classified documents, according to a property receipt that was also made public by the DOJ."},

The judge scheduled a Thursday hearing to discuss the matter further. A special master is often a former judge. Cannon also directed the Justice Department to file under seal with her more detailed descriptions of the material taken from Trump's property. The former president's lawyers have complained that investigators did not disclose enough information to them about what specific documents were removed when agents executed a search warrant on Aug. 8 to look for classified documents.

John Eastman also invoked protections under attorney-client privilege in refusing to answer at least some questions he was asked before the grand jury, which was convened as part of a criminal probe into the possibility of illegal interference in Georgia's presidential election contest, his attorneys said. Eastman is one of a group of Trump allies who were subpoenaed by that panel, which is hearing testimony in Atlanta. A second ally, Trump's former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, has been named a target in that investigation and recently testified before the same grand jury. Eastman wrote a series of memos after the 2020 election calling on then-Vice President Mike Pence to effectively undo President Joe Biden 's win by refusing to certify the Electoral College results. \"In his appearance before the Fulton County Special Grand Jury, we advised our client John Eastman to assert attorney-client privilege and the constitutional right to remain silent where appropriate,\" Eastman's lawyers, Charles Burnham and Harvey Silverglate, said in a statement. \"Out of respect for grand jury secrecy we will not disclose the substance of the questions or testimony. We wish to thank the grand jurors for their service,\" the attorneys said. The statement also blasted Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis for the probe itself. \"By all indications, the District Attorney's Office has set itself on an unprecedented path of criminalizing controversial or disfavored legal theories, possibly in hopes that the federal government will follow its lead,\" the lawyers said. \"Criminalization of unpopular legal theories is against every American tradition and would have ended the careers of John Adams, Ruth Ginsburg, Thurgood Marshall and many other now-celebrated American lawyers,\" the statement said. Adams was the second president of the United States, while Ginsburg and Marshall were Supreme Court justices who helped establish new legal precedents with their work during the civil rights movement. \"We ask all interested observers of any political persuasion to join us in decrying this troubling development,\" Burnham and Silverglate wrote. Eastman last month revealed that his cellphone was seized by federal agents who stopped him in New Mexico and forced him to unlock it. That seizure was done as part of an investigation by the Justice Department's internal watchdog, the Office of the Inspector General. The IG's office is probing the role of the Justice Department and its components in \"preparing for and responding to\" the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters, according to the office's website. That riot occurred as a joint session of Congress was convened to certify Biden's victory, with Pence presiding over the proceedings. A former Justice Department official, Jeffrey Clark, had electronics seized from his Virginia home on the same day that Eastman's phone was seized. Clark also backed Trump's effort to overturn the election. Trump considered installing Clark as attorney general in the days leading up to Jan. 6, 2021, but dropped the idea after a group of top Justice officials said they would resign in protest if that happened."},

Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and FBI agents along with NYPD detectives were seen carrying boxes during a search of 19 Duck Pond Lane in Southampton, N.Y., and the search of 515 Park Ave. in Manhattan. Records show those properties are linked to sanctioned Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, a billionaire and close ally of President Vladimir Putin who heads the Moscow-based Renova Group, a conglomerate with interests in the metals, mining, and tech industries, according to U.S. Treasury Department documents. A search is also underway at a property on Miami's Fisher Island that authorities say was linked to Vekselberg, according to sources familiar with the matter. The U.S. seizure of Vekselberg's $900 million superyacht in early April marked the first under newly imposed Western sanctions targeting assets of Russian elites in response to the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. Vekselberg is one of numerous Russian oligarchs to face sanctions since the start of the war. In addition to sanctions, Vekselberg has been the subject of a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into allegations of bank fraud. No charges have been filed in that case. All of Vekselberg's assets in the U.S. are frozen and American companies are barred from doing business with him and his entities. The Ukrainian-born businessman built his fortune by investing in the aluminum and oil industries in the post-Soviet era. Vekselberg has long had ties to the U.S., including a green card he once held and homes in New York and Connecticut. He was also questioned in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. A call to an attorney associated with the Hamptons property was not immediately returned Thursday. Attempts to reach a representative for Vekselberg were not immediately successful. HSI and FBI confirmed their agents were at those locations but declined further comment. The U.S. Department of Justice and NYPD declined immediate comment. Correction: This article has been updated to correct the location of the U.S. seizure of Vekselberg's $900 million superyacht."},

But details of how many of those records the Mazars USA accounting firm will turn over were not included in a committee statement announcing the agreement Thursday. The deal does not cover a separate lawsuit involving the House Ways and Means Committee, which is seeking Trump's federal tax returns from 2015 through 2020. Last month, a federal appeals court said the Ways and Means Committee could get those returns. The agreement with the Oversight Committee came nearly two months after another panel of judges in the same appeals court in Washington, D.C., upheld a prior ruling that the Oversight Committee had the authority to subpoena certain of Trump's financial records from Mazars in furtherance of legislative purposes. However, the appeals court also told the committee to winnow the scope of the records it wanted to see. On Wednesday, Trump's lawyers told the court in a filing that in light of the settlement agreement with the Oversight Committee, he would drop a motion seeking a rehearing of the case, and a related one asking that the entire lineup of judges on the appeals court take up the issue. In a statement, committee Chairwoman Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said, \"After facing years of delay tactics, the Committee has now reached an agreement with the former President and his accounting firm, Mazars USA, to obtain critical documents.\" \"These documents will inform the Committee's efforts to get to the bottom of former President Trump's egregious conduct and ensure that future presidents do not abuse their position of power for personal gain,\" Maloney said. The committee said that under the agreement, \"Mazars USA has agreed to comply with the court's order and produce responsive documents to the Committee as expeditiously as possible.\" A lawyer for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The committee sought the documents in 2019 as part of its investigation into Trump's conflicts of interest involving his businesses while serving as president and his foreign financial ties. The panel issued its subpoena to Mazars for Trump's records after his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, testified to the Oversight Committee that Trump's financial statements had falsely represented his financial position. Trump then sued to block Mazars from surrendering the records. The case ended up before the Supreme Court, which in 2020 sent the lawsuit back to lower federal courts with the direction to apply a new standard for evaluating the merit of congressional subpoenas for a president's personal information."},

The narrowly focused filing in U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach came one day after the Department of Justice argued that appointing a special master could harm the government's national security interests. The DOJ's filing also said that \"efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation\" into the records that had been shipped to Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence after the end of his presidency. And the DOJ revealed that the FBI seized more than 100 classified documents from the Palm Beach resort during its search of the premises earlier this month. The agency also shared a redacted FBI photo showing documents with classification markings that had been recovered from a container in Trump's \"45 Office.\" Trump's legal team in its Wednesday night reply accused the DOJ of twisting \"the framework of responding to a motion for a Special Master into an all-encompassing challenge to any judicial consideration, presently or in the future, of any aspect of its unprecedented behavior in this investigation.\" The government's \"extraordinary document\" suggests \"that the DOJ, and the DOJ alone, should be entrusted with the responsibility of evaluating its unjustified pursuit of criminalizing a former President's possession of personal and Presidential records in a secure setting,\" Trump's lawyers wrote. They also accused the DOJ of providing multiple \"misleading or incomplete statement[s] of purported 'fact,'\" but offered few specifics. Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, has set a hearing for Thursday at 1 p.m. ET in a West Palm Beach courthouse. Trump had sued to block the Justice Department from further investigating any materials taken in the Mar-a-Lago raid until a special master is able to analyze them. That step is typically taken when there is a chance that some evidence should be withheld from prosecutors because of various legal privileges. The DOJ told the judge on Monday that its review of the seized materials was complete, and that a law enforcement team had identified a \"limited set\" of materials that may be protected by attorney-client privilege. That privilege often refers to the legal doctrine that protects the confidentiality of communications between an attorney and their client. Trump's lawyers responded Wednesday that the so-called privilege review team was \"wholly deficient\" in identifying and separating all potentially privileged documents from the rest of the seized materials. Trump and his office have publicly claimed that he declassified all the documents that had been seized by the FBI. But Trump's legal team has not made that explicit argument in the civil lawsuit before Cannon. The DOJ in Tuesday's late-night filing said that when 15 boxes were retrieved from Mar-a-Lago by the National Archives in January, Trump \"never asserted executive privilege over any of the documents nor claimed that any of the documents in the boxes containing classification markings had been declassified.\" The government also said that no claims about declassification were made when FBI agents went to Mar-a-Lago on June 3, pursuant to a grand jury subpoena to collect any more records in Trump's possession that bore classification markings. The DOJ said it obtained that subpoena in May, after the FBI developed evidence that dozens of boxes with classified information \u2014 beyond the 15 boxes retrieved in January \u2014 were still at Trump's residence. \"When producing the documents, neither counsel nor the custodian asserted that the former President had declassified the documents or asserted any claim of executive privilege. Instead, counsel handled them in a manner that suggested counsel believed that the documents were classified: the production included a single Redweld envelope, double-wrapped in tape, containing the documents,\" the DOJ wrote. At the same time, Trump's custodian of records had also provided a sworn certification letter, claiming that \"any and all\" documents responsive to a grand jury subpoena had been handed over, the DOJ wrote. But the FBI later \"uncovered multiple sources of evidence\" indicating that more classified documents remained at Mar-a-Lago, according to the DOJ's filing. \"The government also developed evidence that government records were likely concealed and removed from the Storage Room and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government's investigation,\" the DOJ wrote. That and other information led the government to seek a warrant to search Mar-a-Lago, which was ultimately carried out Aug. 8. In their reply on Wednesday, Trump's lawyers wrote that the DOJ's account of the June 3 meeting \"has been significantly mischaracterized.\" \"If the Government provided the same untrue account in the affidavit in support of the search warrant, then they misled the Magistrate Judge,\" the former president's lawyers wrote. Trump, in a social media post earlier Wednesday evening, also accused the DOJ of being \"very deceiving\" by sharing a photo that appears to show numerous classified papers strewn about on a carpeted floor. Trump clarified that the FBI \"took them out of cartons and spread them around on the carpet, making it look like a big 'find' for them.\" \"They dropped them, not me - Very deceiving...And remember, we could have NO representative, including lawyers, present during the Raid. They were told to wait outside,\" Trump wrote."},

Charlie Crist resigns from Congress as he takes on GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis in Florida ", "paragraphs": " Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist announced Wednesday he will resign from Congress as he campaigns to unseat Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in November. The move will shrink Democrats' already-slim majority in the House, potentially complicating efforts to pass more legislation before the midterm elections when Republicans are currently favored to take control. Serving in Congress \"has been an honor and a privilege,\" Crist said in a statement, which did not mention his campaign for governor. \"From the bottom of my heart, thank you for trusting me as your Representative in Washington.\" Crist will step down by the close of business Wednesday, he said in the statement. Congressional staff for Crist's district will provide casework and constituent services until the next representatives are sworn in in January, the statement said. Florida's 13th Congressional District, where Crist has served since 2017, is considered a likely pickup for Republicans this November, according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. The district's political makeup shifted toward the GOP after a new congressional map, proposed by DeSantis, re-shaped the area. Crist handily won the Democratic nomination for Florida's gubernatorial race. But polls show him trailing DeSantis, a dominant figure in the GOP who is widely rumored to be gearing up for a 2024 presidential run. DeSantis has also far outraised Crist: The powerful Republican incumbent governor's campaign has raised more than $165 million since 2019, OpenSecrets reported earlier this month. DeSantis' stature in the party is exceeded perhaps only by former President Donald Trump, who has regularly teased the possibility of launching another White House bid. Crist's move mirrors DeSantis' decision in 2018 to resign from Congress as he campaigned for governor in a hotly contested race against Democrat Andrew Gillum. DeSantis at the time said that he did not want to be criticized for taking a U.S. representative's paycheck while missing votes."},

The letter dated Friday from National Intelligence Director (DNI) Avril Haines to House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff and Oversight Committee chair Carolyn Maloney also said the Justice Department and DNI \"are working together to facilitate a classification review\" of materials including those recovered during the search. Schiff and Maloney said in a joint statement they were pleased the government was \"assessing the damage caused by the improper storage of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.\" Politico reported the letter earlier. The Justice Department on Friday disclosed that it was investigating Trump for removing White House records because it believed he illegally held documents including some involving intelligence-gathering and clandestine human sources \u2014 among America's most closely held secrets. Haines said DNI \"will also lead an Intelligence Community (IC) assessment of the potential risk to national security that would result from the disclosure of the relevant documents\" including those seized. The Justice Department on Friday released a heavily redacted affidavit that underpinned the FBI's extraordinary search of Mar-a-Lago in which agents seized 11 sets of classified records including some labeled \"top secret\" as documents that could gravely threaten national security if exposed. In the affidavit, an unidentified FBI agent said the agency reviewed and identified 184 documents \"bearing classification markings\" containing \"national defense information\" after Trump in January returned 15 boxes of government records sought by the U.S. National Archives. Other records in those boxes, according to the affidavit, bore handwritten notes by Trump. Schiff and Maloney said the Justice Department release Friday \"affirms our grave concern that among the documents stored at Mar-a-Lago were those that could endanger human sources. It is critical that the IC move swiftly to assess and, if necessary, to mitigate the damage done.\" The search was part of a federal investigation into whether Trump illegally removed and kept documents when he left office in January 2021 after losing the 2020 election to President Joe Biden and whether Trump tried to obstruct the probe. Trump, a Republican who is considering another presidential run in 2024, has described the court-approved search at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach as politically motivated, and on Friday again described it as a \"break-in.\""},

The president's remarks came after Idaho-based microchip manufacturer Micron announced plans Thursday to invest approximately $15 billion over the next decade in a new memory manufacturing facility in Boise. The lab, which is the first of its kind built in America in over 20 years, is projected to create 17,000 new American jobs by the end of 2032, according to the company. \"Today's announcement by Micron is another big win for America,\" Biden said in a statement. Micron President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra thanked the Biden administration and members of Congress for bipartisan support of the CHIPS Act \"which made this investment decision possible.\" \"This is the first of Micron's multiple planned U.S. investments following the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act, and represents the largest private investment ever made in Idaho,\" Mehrotra said in a statement. \"Our new leading-edge memory manufacturing fab will fuel U.S. technology leadership, ensuring a reliable domestic supply of semiconductors that is critical to economic and national security.\" Over $52 billion was allotted to U.S. companies producing computer chips under the act, along with billions in tax credits to spur investments in semiconductor manufacturing to enable the U.S. to compete with East Asia. The region accounts for 75% of global production of semiconductors. Biden signed the CHIPS Act into law in early August. Micron first announced a $40 billion investment in memory chip manufacturing at that time. The investment, said the White House, will create 40,000 new jobs in construction and manufacturing and raise the U.S. market share of memory chip production from less than 2% to up to 10% over the next 10 years. In his statement Thursday, Biden also mentioned similar growth projections from manufacturing companies First Solar, Toyota, Honda and Corning over the past week. The announcements are a \"direct result of my economic plan,\" he said. Solar power company First Solar announced $1.2 billion in developments Tuesday, including a new factory in the southeastern part of the country and an expansion of its Northwest Ohio manufacturing footprint. The investments will add at least 850 new manufacturing jobs with the additional goal of supporting over 15,000 jobs by 2025, according to a press release. Vehicle manufacturers Toyota and Honda revealed a respective $2.5 billion additional investment in Toyota's North American battery manufacturing facility and a $4.4 billion joint venture with LG Energy Solutions to manufacture lithium-ion batteries in the U.S. that will power Honda and Acura EV models for the domestic market. Toyota's new venture will add 350 jobs, bringing total employment to approximately 2,100, according to a statement. A representative for Honda did not respond to a request for comment before publication. Corning, a New York-based advanced optics manufacturer, said Tuesday it is partnering with AT&T in a new optical cable manufacturing facility in Arizona. The facility will bring approximately 250 jobs to the area and is expected to open in 2024, according to a press release. \"In our future, we will make EVs, chips, fiber optics, and other critical components here in America, and we will have an economy built from the bottom up and middle out,\" Biden said Thursday. The economy has added 3.3 million jobs this year as the unemployment rate has fallen to 3.5%, tied for the lowest since 1969. For August, payrolls growth is expected to rise by 318,000 after growing by 528,000 in July. However, Federal Reserve officials have warned that their intentions to continue raising interest rates to combat inflation could raise the level of unemployment in the months ahead. \u2014 CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this article."},

Judge Aileen Cannon also will make public a status report by the investigation team probing the removal of documents from the White House when Trump left office in early 2021. But Cannon ended the hearing without ruling on a pending request by Trump to appoint an independent watchdog, known as a special master, who would review government documents seized by the FBI before the Department of Justice would be allowed to use the records to advance its probe. Cannon said she will rule later on that request, which Trump made in a lawsuit filed last month in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Trump's lawyers had requested a more detailed list of documents taken from Mar-a-Lago than the less revealing inventory they have previously received from investigators. The DOJ is opposing the call for a special master, arguing that it will unjustifiably delay its criminal investigation. The Justice Department also has said that a review of the documents by a team of internal department watchdogs already has completed its own review and identified some records that would potentially be exempt from use in the investigation because they are protected by attorney-client privilege. In a separate ruling Thursday, Cannon said she will keep sealed a status report on that review by the DOJ's so-called filter team. Jay Bratt, the DOJ's top counterintelligence official, also argued at the hearing that Trump is not entitled to a review of the documents by a special master because \"he is no longer the president.\" \"And because he's no longer the president, he had no right to those documents ... that ends the analysis,\" Bratt said. Special masters, often drawn from the ranks of retired judges, are typically appointed in cases where there is a risk that some of the records seized by law enforcement should be barred from use in an investigation because they are protected by attorney-client privilege. Trump's lawyers, however, argue that some of the records could be protected by executive privilege that would result from him having been president at the time they were created. In a court filing Tuesday, the DOJ revealed that more than 100 classified documents were found at Mar-a-Lago, the private club in Palm Beach, Florida, where Trump maintains a residence, during the Aug. 8 raid. That discovery came two months after Trump's lawyers, in response to a federal grand jury subpoena, provided the DOJ with a sworn certification that a search of Trump's living quarters and office had not found records that were marked classified. Tuesday's filing said there is evidence that government records including the ones marked classified were likely concealed and removed from a storage room at that residence in an effort to \"obstruct the government's investigation.\" Authorities have said the National Archives and Records Administration tried for about a year after Trump left the White House in January 2021 to obtain documents it suspected were still in his possession. When Trump did give up 15 boxes of records from Mar-a-Lago earlier this year, they were found to contain highly classified material, leading to the opening of the DOJ probe, and eventually the Aug. 8 raid. Trump has argued that he declassified the records before leaving office. But whether or not the documents remain classified is irrelevant under the criminal laws that the DOJ is eyeing in the case, which include the espionage statute and obstruction of justice. By law, White House records must be turned over to NARA when a president leaves office. During Thursday's hearing, Trump lawyer Jim Trusty repeated an analogy that has become popular among defenders of the former president on the records issue. \"We've characterized it at times as an overdue library book scenario where there's a dispute \u2014 not even a dispute \u2014 but ongoing negotiations with [the National Archives] that has suddenly been transformed into a criminal investigation,\" Trusty said, according to NBC News. Trusty's claim omitted mention of a grand jury subpoena issued for the documents."},

The previously unreported photo, released by the War College to Reuters after a request under the Freedom of Information Act, showed Mastriano in a 2013-14 portrait for the Department of Military Strategy, Plans, and Operations, where he worked. Faculty at the time had been given the option of dressing as a historical figure, people familiar with the photo said. At least 15 of the 21 faculty in the photo opted to appear in regular attire. Although one man wears a trench coat and sunglasses and another carries an aviator's helmet, Mastriano is the only one wearing a Confederate uniform. Mastriano did not immediately respond to requests for comment made by email and phone. A Reuters reporter attended a Mastriano event on Wednesday to seek comment, but the candidate did not make himself available for questions. Displays of Confederate symbols can be seen as insensitive to those who view them as painful reminders of racial oppression and the Civil War that saw 11 rebelling Confederate states fight to keep Black people enslaved. The U.S. military issued a de facto ban on displaying the Confederate flag and has sought to remove segregationist symbols from bases and academic institutions following the murder in May 2020 of George Floyd, a Black man whose killing by a white police officer in Minneapolis triggered protests worldwide. After Reuters made its formal request for the photo, it was removed from the War College wall where it had hung alongside other annual portraits of faculty groups. The Army War College (AWC), a premier military higher education institution in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, told Reuters a team had reviewed all art, text, and other images displayed at Carlisle Barracks in 2020, but missed the faculty photo. \"The faculty photo did not get the team's attention; the photo has since been removed because it does not meet AWC values,\" the college said in a statement. Asked about the War College photo, a spokesperson at U.S. Army headquarters said: \"The Army supports commanders who remove symbols or images that do not comport with Army values.\" Confederate symbols and dress have been embraced by white supremacists in the United States, and monuments and flags honoring the Confederacy have been removed from many public areas in recent years. Pennsylvania plays an outsized role in U.S. politics as a so-called swing state in presidential elections, and Republican Mastriano, who has embraced Trump's stolen election lies, is trailing his Democratic opponent in the governor's race ahead of the November ballot. It is unclear how the photo might be viewed in Pennsylvania, which played a critical role in the Civil War. More than 33,000 soldiers from Pennsylvania died fighting for the Union, and the state was the site of the Battle of Gettysburg, the conflict's bloodiest battle, which ended with a Union victory and inspired President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. Mastriano's district, Pennsylvania's 33rd, includes Gettysburg. Many Americans continue to participate in Civil War battle re-enactments, wearing uniforms from both sides in an effort to preserve U.S. history."},

It was already known that the conservative advocate Ginni Thomas had contacted legislators in Arizona with a similar request seeking to undo Biden's victory there. The Washington Post first reported Thursday that she wrote two Republican legislators in Wisconsin, state Sen. Kathy Bernier and state Rep. Gary Tauchen, on Nov. 9, 2020, at \"virtually the same time the Arizona lawmakers received a verbatim copy of the message from Thomas.\" Bernier at the time was the chair of the state Senate elections committee. Thomas sent the emails days after Trump refused to concede the election to Biden, vowing, \"We'll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court.\" The subject lines of her messages read, \"Please do your Constitutional duty!\" \"Please stand strong in the face of media and political pressure,\" those emails said, according to The Post, which obtained them from the watchdog group Documented. \"Please reflect on the awesome authority granted to you by our Constitution. And then please take action to ensure that a clean slate of Electors is chosen for our state,\" Thomas wrote. Documented obtained the emails through a request under Wisconsin's public records laws. The group posted a copy of the emails online later Thursday. The report comes more than a month after Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said the select House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, pro-Trump riot at the U.S. Capitol was considering issuing a subpoena to Ginni Thomas. Thomas sent the emails to Arizona and Wisconsin lawmakers via the online site FreeRoots, which provides pre-written messages that can be sent to multiple elected officials. Arizona and Wisconsin sent Biden electors to the Electoral College, as he won the popular vote in both states. The Electoral College then named him the winner of the 2020 vote. A lawyer for Thomas and a spokeswoman for the Supreme Court did not immediately respond to requests for comment from CNBC about her emails. Thomas' advocacy for conservative causes while her husband serves on the high court has generated controversy in recent years. Thomas sent 29 messages to Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows after the 2020 election encouraging him to pursue then-ongoing efforts to undo Biden's victory, CBS News reported in March. \"Help This Great President stand firm, Mark!!! ...You are the leader, with him, who is standing for America's constitutional governance at the precipice,\" she wrote Meadows on Nov. 10, 2020. \"The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History.\" Several efforts to effectively overturn Trump's losses in battleground states ended up at the Supreme Court after the election. None of those efforts succeeded. In January, Clarence Thomas was the only Supreme Court justice to support Trump's request to block White House records from being sent to the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot. That riot began after Trump and his allies falsely claimed for weeks that he had actually won the presidential election and that Biden's victory was the result of widespread ballot fraud in states that included Arizona and Wisconsin. The violence disrupted a joint session of Congress for hours as lawmakers gathered to confirm Biden's Electoral College win."},

The remarks from the former head of the DOJ came as court documents revealed more information about the agency's criminal investigation into the shipment of classified government records to Mar-a-Lago after Trump left the White House. FBI agents found four dozen empty document folders marked \"CLASSIFIED\" during their raid last month of Trump's club, a newly unsealed court file revealed earlier Friday. Forty-three of those folders were collected from Trump's office, the court filing said. The Aug. 8 raid came months after the National Archives retrieved 15 boxes of materials from Trump's Palm Beach, Florida, resort home in January. FBI agents went to Mar-a-Lago in June to collect all additional records that bore classification markings. But the FBI later \"uncovered multiple sources of evidence\" indicating that more classified documents remained at Mar-a-Lago, leading them to seek a warrant to search the premises, according to a DOJ court filing. Barr said Friday that the search warrant suggests that \"for them to have taken things to the current point they probably have pretty good evidence, but that's speculation.\" Barr also cast doubt on Trump's claims that he declassified the documents that were taken from Mar-a-Lago, calling it \"highly improbable.\" But if Trump indeed \"stood over scores of boxes, not really knowing what was in them and said, I hereby declassify everything in here that would be such an abuse and that shows such recklessness that it's almost worse than taking the documents,\" Barr said. Barr was sworn in as Trump's attorney general in February 2019. He oversaw the controversial public release of former special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian meddling and possible coordination with the Trump campaign in the 2016 election. Critics accused him of misrepresenting the Mueller report's conclusions when he released a four-page summary of it weeks before the full report came out. Less than a month after Trump lost to President Joe Biden in the 2020 election, Barr publicly split with his boss by undermining his false claims that the race was rigged through widespread fraud. Trump has maintained that the race was rigged against him, even after he left office on Jan. 20, 2021. As recently as this week, Trump has demanded that he should either be declared the \"rightful winner,\" or that a do-over election should be held \"immediately.\" Barr, in an interview published Dec. 1, 2020, told The Associated Press that the DOJ has \"not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.\" Trump announced Barr's resignation two weeks later."},

Agents found 43 of those empty folders marked classified in Trump's office, according to the Department of Justice's inventory of the seized items, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The remaining five empty folders with that marking were found in containers in a storage room. The FBI also found another 42 empty folders marked \"Return to Staff Secretary/Miliary [sic] Aide,\" during the Aug. 8 raid, which was authorized to search for government documents removed from the White House when Trump left office in Jan. 2021, the filing said. Twenty-eight of those empty folders were found in Trump's office, while another 14 were in a storage room elsewhere, the document shows. And FBI agents found more than 10,000 government documents and photographs without classification markings, the filing shows. Among those were hundreds of photos and news articles, along with gifts, clothing, and books. The bombshell revelations raise the prospect that the DOJ has not yet recovered the documents that would have been in the empty folders. The DOJ is investigating possible crimes related to the removal of those and other government documents from the White House when Trump left office in Jan. 2021. By law, such records must be turned over to the National Archives and Records Administration. On Tuesday, the DOJ said in another court filing that more than 100 classified documents were found at Mar-a-Lago. That property receipt noted that the government seized 11 sets of classified documents, as well as an executive grant of clemency regarding Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative and Trump confidant. The previously disclosed property inventory of items seized lists multiple U.S. government documents with \"confidential,\" \"secret\" and \"top secret\" classification markings. The detailed inventory made public Friday was one of two court filings related to the FBI raid that were ordered unsealed by Judge Aileen Cannon after she conducted a hearing Thursday on a request by Trump's lawyers to appoint a third-party to review the seized records. The other document unsealed Friday is titled, \"Notice of Investigative Team of Status of Review,\" and notes that the criminal probe did not end with the raid. It was signed by Miami U.S. Attorney Juan Gonzalez, and Jay Bratt, the chief of the counterintelligence and export control section of the national security division of the Justice Department. \"The seized materials will continue to be used to further the government's investigation, and the investigative team will continue to use and evaluate the seized materials as it takes further investigative steps, such as through additional interviews and grand jury practice,\" that notice says. \"It is important to note, 'review' of the seized materials is not a single investigative step but an ongoing process in this active criminal investigation,\" the document says. Trump's spokesman in a series of tweets about the inventory of the seized items again criticized the raid. \"The new 'detailed' inventory list only further proves that this unprecedented and unnecessary raid of President Trump's home was not some surgical, confined search and retrieval that the Biden administration claims, it was a SMASH AND GRAB,\" wrote the spokesman, Taylor Budowich. \"These document disputes should be resolved under the Presidential Records Act, which requires cooperation and negotiation by NARA [National Archives and Records Administration], not an armed FBI raid,\" Budowich added. Trump in a lawsuit filed in late August asked Cannon to appoint an independent watchdog, known as a special master, to review the items seized in the search before the DOJ is allowed to continue using the documents in the investigation. Trump's lawyers have said a special master could check to see if some documents would be prohibited from being used in the probe because they are protected by either attorney-client privilege or executive privilege. The DOJ has opposed the appointment of a special master, saying that it would delay the investigation, and that Trump does not own the documents. Cannon, during a court hearing in Florida on that dispute Thursday, said she will issue a ruling on the special master request in \"due course.\" Cannon, a Trump appointee, previously shared her \"preliminary intent\" to grant Trump's request for a special master. The judge suggested in Thursday's hearing that she is still considering that appointment, news outlets reported."},

The allegations against Kristina Karamo, which she denied in a statement late Friday afternoon, came to light two months before the election for secretary of state, the top election official of Michigan. Michigan is one of several states that Trump falsely claims he lost due to widespread ballot fraud in the 2020 presidential election against President Joe Biden. Karamo has backed those claims. Trump, when he endorsed Karamo, said, \"Good luck Kristina, and while you're at it, check out the fake election results that took place in the city of Detroit.\" Her ex-husband Adom Karamo made the explosive allegations about her in a Michigan family court filing last October as he asked the court to award him 75 days of overnight stays with their daughters at his home in Florida during their breaks from school. The filing was first obtained and published by the online site Jezebel.com. Kristina on one occasion said, \"F--- it, I'll kill us all,\" as she tried to grab the steering wheel and \"crash\" a car driven by her husband, and carrying their two teenagers, Adom wrote in the filing. In his motion last fall, Adom Karamo also alleged that Kristina, who is a community college professor, was \"committed to an institution for evaluation due to her efforts at self-harm and suicide.\" \"Father was in fact trapped in the marriage for years, always subject to the threat of Mother committing suicide,\" he wrote. Adom wrote that he did not believe at the time of the motion that Kristina \"is currently in this state of mind, as this was several years ago.\" \"| do believe, however, that her children have been the only thing that has kept her sane,\" he added in the filing. In her statement Friday, Kristina said, \"I have never harmed my children, any claims that I have are categorically false.\" \"My ex-husband, making false allegations in 2021 on social media and in court documents, was an attempt to exploit the fact that I am a public figure, using it as leverage to change the custody agreement he became dissatisfied with,\" Kristina wrote. She also said that \"media entities and my opponents are desperate, so they want to push false allegations with ZERO evidence.\" \"I love my children; I have forgiven my ex-husband and I look forward to serving the citizens of Michigan,\" she wrote. Kristina was formally nominated as the GOP's candidate for secretary of state on Saturday. She faces the Democratic incumbent Jocelyn Benson in the general election. Kristina Karamo's lawyer Dennis Zamplas, who denied the allegations in a court filing last fall, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump also did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Michigan Republican Party declined to comment. CNBC was unable to contact Adom Karamo by phone. Zamplas, in a response to Adom's motion in October, called the allegations about Kristina threatening to harm their family \"false.\" Zamplas also wrote that Adom \"went on social media\" last year, when Kristina was an announced candidate for office, \"to publicize these false allegations.\" Adom then texted Kristina \"to threaten her that if his parenting time demands were not met, he was going to take an interview with a news station to further publicize these false allegations,\" the lawyer wrote. Jezebel noted that in February, a judge granted Adom about 60 overnight stays with his daughters. Karamo was listed as a speaker at a 2021 conference associated with QAnon, a false Internet-spread conspiracy that casts Trump as a hero waging a secret battle against powerful groups of pedophiles and Satan worshippers. And she reportedly shared the false claim that the rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, disrupting Congress' confirmation of Biden's victory in the national election, were \"Antifa posing as Trump supporters.\""},

The White House's hope is that it will remain a winning strategy two months out from the midterm elections which will decide who controls the House of Representatives and Senate. The trip marks his second visit to the critical swing state of Pennsylvania in three days. \"For a long time, we've reassured ourselves that American democracy is guaranteed. But it is not,\" Biden said. \"We have to defend it. Protect it. Stand up for it. Each and every one of us. That's why tonight I'm asking our nation to come together and unite behind the single purpose of defending our democracy regardless of your ideology.\" Democrats' odds of keeping their majorities in both chambers of Congress have brightened in recent weeks despite the mixed economic signals, as Republicans continue to receive blowback from the Supreme Court's decision on abortion overturning Roe v. Wade and investigations into Trump persist. An NBC News poll released last week found a majority of American voters, 58%, disapprove of the Dobbs decision and nearly the same amount, 57%, believe the investigations into Trump should continue. \"MAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards,\" Biden said. \"Backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love.\" Since Trump entered office, Biden has said the country faces \"a battle for the soul of the nation.\" The significance of the threat to democracy is underscored by Biden's choice of venue: Independence National Historic Park where the Constitution was penned. The same NBC News poll found that \"threats to democracy\" has overtaken the cost of living as the most pressing issue on voters' minds. Biden has amped up his criticism of Republicans recently, seeking to position Democrats as an alternative to a party led by extremists. Last week he referred to Republicans as \"semi-fascist\" for staying loyal to the former president. His remarks come against the backdrop of Trump's legal woes following the FBI raid on his Florida home Mar-A-Lago where the former president is accused of mishandling classified information."},

The announcement came on the same day the Biden administration confirmed its top climate advisor Gina McCarthy is leaving in two weeks. Her deputy Ali Zaidi, who worked on climate initiatives in the Obama White House, will take over the job. Podesta, who led former President Barack Obama's climate strategy, will be tasked with doling out tax credits for clean energy products like solar panels and electric vehicles, and toward research and development in renewable energy production. More recently, Podesta served as chair of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and founded the left-leaning think tank\nThe Center for American Progress. \"We are fortunate that John Podesta will lead our continued innovation and implementation,\" the White House said in a statement. \"His deep roots in climate and clean energy policy and his experience at senior levels of government mean we can truly hit the ground running to take advantage of the massive clean energy opportunity in front of us.\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed McCarthy's Sept. 16 departure at a press briefing Friday. \"Gina is indeed leaving us,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"She, as you know, has been a leader in what we have seen as one of the largest investment in dealing with climate change.\""},

Lindsey Graham says he was stating the obvious with Trump riots claim", "paragraphs": " U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham on Saturday defended suggesting there would be \"riots in the streets\" if former President Donald Trump was prosecuted for mishandling classified information, saying he condemned the violence seen during the Capitol riot last year. \"What I tried to do was state the obvious,\" Graham, a South Carolina Republican and close ally of Trump, told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick at the Ambrosetti Forum in Italy. \"Here's what I said, The raid on [former] President Trump's home, the likely nominee for 2024, better bear some fruit here,\" he added. \"If it's just about mishandling classified information, we've had a standard set when it came to Hillary Clinton.\" \"Our country, the people on our side, believe that when it comes to the justice system, there are no rules regarding Trump, [it's a case of] 'get him, it doesn't matter how you get him,' so I said that if it's similar to what happened to Clinton and he gets prosecuted, it'll be one of the most disruptive events in America,\" Graham said. Trump and his allies have argued that the FBI, which is investigating Trump for potential violations of laws related to espionage and obstruction of justice, is treating him differently than it treated Hillary Clinton, who was the subject of an FBI investigation into her use of a private email server while secretary of state, but wasn't prosecuted. Trump's critics argue that the two cases aren't comparable. Graham said he rejected the violence seen on the Jan.6 Capitol riot and said \"all those people who defiled the Capitol should go to jail\" but said that any perceived unfairness toward Trump would have consequences. \"I don't want to pardon the January 6th people because that seems to reinforce the narrative that this is OK. I said something I really believe \u2014 if he does what she did with classified information and he gets prosecuted and she didn't it would create a problem.\" Graham said last week that there would be \"riots in the streets\" if Trump was prosecuted for mishandling classified information. \"I'll say this, if there's a prosecution of Donald Trump for mishandling classified information, after the Clinton debacle \u2026 there'll be riots in the streets,\" Graham told Fox News' Trey Gowdy, a former Republican congressman. Trump is currently under investigation and risks being indicted over his treatment of classified White House records that he took to his residence in Mar-a-Lago, Florida. Last week, the release of a heavily redacted affidavit showed how concerns about illegal activity and obstruction of justice led to an FBI search at Trump's resort in July. Graham conceded that he believed in \"handling classified information responsibly\" but again insisted that \"mishandling classified information is really bad but we can't have a system where one person gets prosecuted and the other doesn't.\" Asked whether Trump is the best person to represent the Republican Party in 2024, Graham said \"I think he could be.\" \"Whether you like Trump or not he was a consequential president ... I think a strong American president, unpredictable, is a good thing as long as you keep it within the boundaries. His problem is personal, his policies have stood the test of time but has he worn the American people out in terms of his personality? Time will tell. But I'll say this, after the Biden presidency, if there's a policy debate in 2024, I like his chances. If it's a personality contest, he'll be in trouble.\" Graham said he talks to Trump \"all the time\" and that the former president still thinks that he was \"cheated.\" Graham said he voted to certify the 2020 election and that Biden is the legitimate president. Trump \"genuinely believes that the system was rigged against him and I said 'Mr. President, I'm not trying to tell you to change your beliefs. I'm trying to tell you that you have no chance of winning in 2020 but you have a pretty good chance of winning in 2024 if you want to,'\" Graham said, noting that he told Trump that if he does make a comeback \"it will be one of the greatest political comebacks in American history.\" A federal judge on Thursday denied Graham's latest effort to challenge a subpoena for his testimony before a special grand jury in Georgia, which is investigating possible criminal election interference by Trump and his allies in 2020. However, the judge limited the scope of the subpoena by ordering that Graham could not be questioned about phone calls he made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and his staff in the weeks after the November 2020 election between Trump and President Joe Biden. It follows continued bids by Graham to avoid testifying on the grounds that his position as a lawmaker grants him immunity under the U.S. Constitution's \"speech or debate\" clause. Graham reiterated his position on Saturday, saying \"I didn't start this debate. You have a country prosecutor who has decided to investigate a national election and to call anybody and everybody connected with the role they played in the election. I'm a United States Senator, in our Constitution, we have a speech or debate immunity clause so that we can't be hauled into courts all over the country every time we do something somebody doesn't like.\" \"I think the court is going to recognize that my activities as a United States Senator was covered by the speech and debate clause that that the county prosecutor's desire to bring me down to Georgia oversteps the constitution.\""},

In the forthcoming book, \"Like, Comment, Subscribe: Inside YouTube\u2019s Chaotic Rise to World Domination,\" author Mark Bergen writes that the executive, known for being loyal to Google cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, talked about becoming Tesla's Chief Operating Officer before becoming YouTube CEO in 2014. At the time, Wojcicki had been senior vice president of ads and commerce at Google and had been looking for a higher-level role, the book said, citing those close to her. \u201cBy then, Page had begun plotting his own exit \u2014 a plan to hand Google off to a trusted deputy, Sundar Pichai,\" Bergen reports. In a conversation, Laszlo Bock, Google's HR chief at the time, said he \"suggested Page could more easily clear the way for his chosen successor by moving Wojcicki to YouTube.\u201d The announcement of Wojcicki's appointment came as a shock to many Googlers, the book says. Wojcicki had one of the earliest connections to Google -- in 1998, she famously let Page and Brin, who still hold majority shareholder voting power of Google parent company Alphabet, work from her garage when they were starting the company. Her sister, 23andMe founder Anne Wojcicki was married and had kids with Brin. In the book, Bock compared Google to a family enterprise, and the book says Wojcicki often was able to get Page's attention. \u201cWhen people couldn\u2019t get him to see reason, she always could,\u201d said former Google director and early Silicon Valley workplace influencer Kim Scott, who referred to her in the book as \u201ca Larry whisperer.\u201d One example is how Google used search data. \"Wojcicki wanted to use search queries to inform ads people saw on all those banner ads Google ran across the web; if advertisers could target consumers based on searches and on websites, they might spend gobs more with Google,\" the book says. Page had long wanted to keep search data from everything else but Wojcicki \"felt this wasn\u2019t keeping up with trends in the ad industry, which sought ever more data.\u201d \u201cThe founders trust Susan maybe more than anybody on the planet,\" Patrick Keane, an early Google sales director, said in the book. \u201cYou could never get Susan rattled, no matter how challenging the moment was.\u201d YouTube was also discussed as a potential spinout, the book reports. The year after Wojcicki\u2019s appointment, in 2015, Larry Page, announced the creation of Alphabet, a new holding company, that would separate several businesses, including self-driving car Waymo and health sciences unit Verily, from Google. \u201cYouTube seemed like a natural splinter; it already operated with a different name and office,\" the book states. \"Leaders there considered plans to become a separate Alphabet unit, detached from Google. Wojcicki wanted to keep reporting to Page, who had appointed himself Alphabet CEO, rather than his successor at Google, Sundar Pichai. But ultimately it was decided YouTube was too intertwined with Google\u2019s business and machinery to leave. So it stayed at Google.\" Under Wojcicki's watch, YouTube grew to reach more than 81% of U.S. adults and generate nearly $29 billion in revenue in 2021."},

The space agency is working toward the debut of its Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule, for what would be a more than month-long journey around the moon. As NASA was filling the rocket on Saturday morning, the agency's team detected a hydrogen fuel leak from the engine section. NASA made several attempts to fix the leak, but time ticked away ahead of the launch window that was set to open at 2:17 p.m. ET. NASA called off a first launch attempt on Monday after it was unable to resolve a temperature problem identified with one of the rocket's four liquid-fueled engines, discovered with less than two hours to go in the countdown. It was unclear whether NASA will be able to make another attempt on its next opportunities for a launch on Monday or Tuesday. If NASA decides not to try again in the coming days, the agency would likely roll the 32-story tall rocket back to the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, which would be a delay of weeks or more. The uncrewed launch is set to mark the debut of the most powerful rocket ever assembled, and kicks off NASA's long-awaited return to the moon's surface.

The comments in a \"Mad Money\" interview came after Signet reported second-quarter results earlier in the day. While earnings per share topped estimates and revenue met expectations, the company's same-store sales fell 8.2% year over year. Wall Street had been expecting a 5.3% decline, which may have contributed to the stock's 12% tumble Thursday. However, Drosos maintained an upbeat outlook for the parent firm of Zales and Kay Jewelers, suggesting near-term headwinds related to inflation do not change the long-term story. \"We had ... significant share growth last year. Tough economic times are another opportunity for us to grow share, thus our acquisition of Blue Nile, and our continued investment in the business,\" said Drosos, explaining that Signet has focused on using its scale and leaning into products like lab-created diamonds to appeal to value-seeking customers. Signet announced in early August it was buying online jewelry brand Blue Nile. While Signet has been investing in its online offerings already, Drosos said Thursday that adding Blue Nile to the fold will help Signet reach new corners of the market. \"It gives us a new consumer cohort,\" the CEO said. \"Blue Nile customers are younger, more affluent, more diverse than we have in the rest of our portfolio, so a great opportunity there.\" Sign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.

This week, pet products retailer Chewy said it's not seeing any significant trade down among shoppers in pet food. Rival pet retailer Petco made similar remarks last week, though both noted a pullback in spending on products such as leashes and toys. The comments are in line with the trend of pet owners increasingly spoiling their cats and dogs with foods that are more like the dishes they'd feed themselves or other family members. To capitalize on the ongoing shift, Petco recently partnered with snack bar maker Clif to sell a version for pets. It also launched a line of frozen, human-grade meals for dogs. \"Pet parents are driving one of the biggest trends the pet industry has seen as they increasingly seek out fresh, human-grade food for all members of the family,\" Petco CEO Ron Coughlin said in a release. Coughlin said the growing \"humanization\" of animal companions is being led by Gen Z and Millennial consumers who are \"hyper focused\" on their pets' health and wellness. In addition to more premium foods, Chewy and Petco see their health products and services as a way to better compete with the low-price offerings from retailers such as Amazon and Walmart. Earlier this month, Chewy expanded its health offerings with CarePlus, a line of pet wellness and insurance offerings. For its second quarter, Chewy said net sales rose 12.8% from a year ago to $2.43 billion as shoppers shifted toward more fresh and premium food products. Petco said its sales rose 3.2% to $1.48 billion and reported a similar shift. Still, the pet category isn't shielded from the soaring inflation that's pressuring consumers. Both Petco and Chewy reported softening demand in products such as crates, beds, leashes and toys over the summer months. Chewy noted that such items don't have to be replaced as often as some other items, and that shoppers are opting to skip on them as prices rise. Chewy said the downturn in such products is temporary and that it expects demand will recover. Brian LaRose, Petco's chief financial officer, also said orders for the products \"are delayed, not canceled.\" Still, both companies tightened their full-year guidance, in part because of the softened demand. Both companies lowered their revenue guidance for the year. Petco said it now expects adjusted earnings per share of 77 to 81 cents. It previously forecast 97 cents to $1. Petco's shares are down down around 24% year to date, while Chewy's stock is down around 41%."},

But that didn't stop the state of Mississippi from paying Favre $1.1 million in 2017 and 2018 to make motivational speeches \u2014 out of federal welfare funds intended for needy families. The Mississippi state auditor said Favre never gave the speeches and demanded the money back, with interest. Favre has repaid the fees, although not the $228,000 in interest the auditor also demanded. But the revelation by the auditor that $70 million in TANF welfare funds was doled out to a multimillionaire athlete, a professional wrestler, a horse farm and a volleyball complex are at the heart of a scandal that has rocked the nation's poorest state, sparking parallel state and federal criminal investigations that have led to charges and guilty pleas involving some of the key players. Favre hasn't been accused of a crime or charged, and he declined an interview. His lawyer, Bud Holmes, said he did nothing wrong and never understood he was paid with money intended to help poor children. Holmes acknowledged that Favre had been questioned by the FBI in the case, a fact that hasn't previously been reported. The saga, which has been boiling at low grade for 2\u00bd years, drew new attention in July, when the state welfare agency fired a lawyer who had been hired to claw back some of the money, just after he issued a subpoena seeking more information about the roles of Favre and the former governor, Phil Bryant, a Republican. The current governor, Republican Tate Reeves, acknowledged playing a role in the decision to sack Brad Pigott, accusing the former Bill Clinton-appointed U.S. attorney of having a political agenda. But the state official who first uncovered the misspending and fraud, auditor Shad White, is a Republican. In his first television interview since he was fired, Pigott said his only agenda was to get at the truth and to recoup U.S. taxpayer funds sent to Mississippi that he says were \"squandered.\" \"The notion of tens of millions of dollars that was intended by the country to go to the alleviation of poverty \u2014 and to see it going toward very different purposes \u2014 was appalling to many of us,\" he said. \"Mr. Favre was a very great quarterback, but having been a great NFL quarterback, he is not well acquainted with poverty.\" Pigott, who before he was fired sued on behalf of Mississippi's welfare agency, naming Favre and 37 other grant recipients, laid ultimate blame at the feet of top Mississippi politicians, including Bryant. \"Governor Bryant gave tens of millions of dollars of this TANF welfare money to a nonprofit led by a person who he knew well and who had more connections with his political party than with the good people in Mississippi who have the heart and the skills to actually cajole people out of poverty or prevent teenage pregnancies,\" he said. In an interview with Mississippi Today, Bryant said he never knew the grants came from welfare money. His lawyer didn't respond to requests for comment. The person in charge of the nonprofit group Pigott was referring to is Nancy New, a close friend of Bryant's wife. New and her son have pleaded guilty to state and federal charges and agreed to cooperate. New, a key player in doling out the money, said in a court document that Bryant was among those involved in directing the transactions. Her lawyer declined to comment. The former head of the state welfare agency, John Davis, has pleaded not guilty to state charges of bribery and conspiracy, and law enforcement officials say the investigations continue. Favre defended himself in a series of tweets last year against charges from state auditor White that he accepted state money for speeches he never intended to give. \"I would never knowingly take funds meant to help our neighbors in need, but for Shad White to continue to push out this lie that the money was for no-show events is something I cannot stay silent about,\" Favre tweeted. The speeches aren't the only welfare grants tied to Favre. Text messages obtained by the website Mississippi Today and authenticated by Pigott show that Favre sought a $3.2 million grant to a drug company in which he was a shareholder and a $5 million award that built a volleyball arena at the University of Southern Mississippi, where his daughter played the sport and where he played football. Favre's lawyer declined to comment. The drug company, Prevacus, was touting treatments to mitigate the effects of concussions, although none were approved by the Food and Drug Administration. In some texts, Favre suggested awarding shares in the drug company to Bryant while he was governor. \"Don't know if legal or not but we need cut him in,\" Favre texted a company official in November 2018, referring to Bryant. Following up three days later, Favre wrote, \"Also if legal I'll give some of my shares to the Governor.\" Bryant has said he never would have accepted such an offer. \"All of it remains quite a mystery,\" Pigott told NBC News, \"as to why Mr. Favre would get the benefit of millions of dollars in TANF welfare money, both for a fee for speeches he didn't make, $2 million-plus to go to a company in which he was the largest outside individual investor and $5 million for his alma mater to play volleyball in a volleyball building.\" The state auditor said he found other \"no show\" contracts benefiting former pro athletes and family members of Davis, the welfare agency director. The auditor said Davis directed one contract to Austin Smith, his nephew, who was paid more than $400,000 to provide \"coding skills\" classes even though prosecutors allege he had no such skills \"and did not know how to teach.\" At least $3 million went to Ted DiBiase, a retired professional wrestler. Marcus Dupree, a former college football star, also received $370,000 in welfare funds, which prosecutors say partly went to fund his horse ranch. Paul LaCoste, who is the current governor's athletic trainer, was paid $300,000 in welfare funds to run a fitness boot camp for legislators. DiBiase, Dupree, LaCoste and Smith didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. The scandal has also spotlighted the meager scope of Mississippi's welfare program and provided a stark reminder of the Clinton-era welfare reform that provided states with block grants and wide latitude in how they spend it. According to state figures, Mississippi rejects more than 90% of those who apply for the federal welfare benefit known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF. This year 2,500 children received benefits, state officials said, in a state with 192,000 poor children. One of those who had trouble getting help was Tamara Edwards, who raised four children on her own while working a series of low-wage jobs. She once received welfare vouchers for child care, and in 2009 she applied again, she said. Even though her income was low enough, she was denied. \"They told me they didn't have the funds,\" said Edwards, who now works as a cook at a Cracker Barrel restaurant. Advocates and state legislators say Mississippi's welfare agency, under years of conservative Republican state governments, has a history of questionable spending and a lack of transparency. \"TANF has been a slush fund for a long time,\" said Oleta Fitzgerald, who is the director of the Children's Defense Fund's Southern Regional Office and is based in Jackson, the state capital. \"Mississippi is the poorest doggone state in the country \u2014 where is the money, and what are they doing with it? There is nobody on welfare \u2014 welfare participation rates are way down \u2014 and no one knows where that money is being spent.\" Aisha Nyandoro, the chief executive of Springboard to Opportunities, a local nonprofit group that works with residents of affordable housing, said: \"And DHS [the state Department of Human Services] will tell you that the reason that they cannot go about allocating the TANF funds is because they can't find any families who are eligible. Go outside and throw a rock. It's Mississippi. You can find an eligible family.\" Jarvis Dortsch, a former state legislator who heads the state's chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said that when he was a member of the Legislature, \"I could not get a list of how the money was being spent.\" Dortsch said he had to resort to secrecy. \"Someone had snuck me a list \u2014 it didn't have [a] DHS [logo] on it \u2014 they had it printed out and snuck it out,\" he said. Shad White, the auditor, told NBC News the investigation goes on. \"My office is continuing the work we started over two years ago on what is now the largest public fraud case in our state's history,\" he said. \"We will also continue to work with our state and federal partners to be sure each person responsible for this massive scheme is held fully accountable under the law.\""},

Investors are looking for clues as to just how aggressive the Federal Reserve could be later this month, when the central bank is widely expected to raise rates again in its fight against inflation. The economy added 315,000 jobs last month. Economists were projecting an increase of 318,000, according to Dow Jones. Starbucks has chosen its next chief executive officer: Laxman Narasimhan, who just resigned as CEO of Reckitt, which owns Lysol cleaning brands, Durex condoms and more. Yet Howard Schultz, who has been the coffee chain's interim CEO since April, isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Narasimhan will join Starbucks in October, but won't take over as the company's chief until April. Schultz will also remain on the company's board and continue to be an advisor after Narasimhan, also a PepsiCo veteran, assumes the role. More details are on the way at Starbucks' investor day, which is slated for Sept. 13 in Seattle. The National Labor Relations Board said Thursday that the Amazon Labor Union's winning effort to unionize a Staten Island, New York, warehouse should be upheld. The e-commerce giant began its formal objection in May, the month after the union won. But the NLRB attorney overseeing the case said Amazon\"had not met its burden\" in its bid to demonstrate that the union used objectionable means to secure its victory. The grassroots Amazon Labor Union, meanwhile, is looking to expand its influence. It failed to unionize another Staten Island warehouse in May, but workers at warehouses in Albany, New York, and Kentucky are seeking to organize with the union. After hours of delays due to shelling in the region Thursday, inspectors with the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency finally made it to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine.

During an interview at the Ambrosetti Forum in Italy it was put to Starace that, in some people's view, oil and gas would be key for energy over the next 25 years, a contention he disputed. \"I totally disagree, because this is a view that is coming from, say, 15 years ago,\" he said. \"Was that wrong at that time? No, it was not. Now it's wrong.\" \"The economy can work much better, relying much less on fossil fuels, than people think,\" he went on to add. \"It will take maybe another two years before everybody understands that \u2014 but we are there.\" Despite this optimism about the future, today's reality on the ground is hugely challenging. The current situation in Europe, where many countries are attempting to wean themselves off Russian energy following the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine, illustrates the crucial role fossil fuels still play in society. With colder months closing in, European nations have been looking to shore up gas storage in a bid to ensure security of supply. Looking ahead, Enel's Starace expressed confidence Europe had prepared for the coming winter. \"Insofar as storage is concerned, Europe \u2026 did the right thing,\" he said, noting that most countries were \"pretty full.\" \"Now, the question is what happens if gas is cut altogether from Russia,\" Starace went on to state. \"Well, we're almost there, the cut is actually almost there.\" \"We have a view, and there are many studies showing that with some sacrifices, [such as] two notches of temperature down, and a little bit of attention to gas consumptions \u2026 Europe can make it through the wintertime.\" \"The question is when we get to the spring [of] 2023 with totally depleted, really, reserves, and gas is still not flowing,\" he said. \"Is Europe able to re-establish the storage, with all the backup of floating regasifiers and energy coming from other parts of the world? I think that's going to be the big challenge.\" The Enel Group \u2014 whose main shareholder is the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance \u2014 has said it will abandon gas generation by 2040. It also plans to leave the retail gas market in 2040. Starace's comments came on the same day that the EU's climate chief, Frans Timmermans, hammered home the urgency of the situation facing European economies in the face of rising energy prices and concerns about supply. \"We need to do everything we can to face this energy crisis and to make sure that we do everything we can to reduce the prices so that our citizens can still afford to heat their homes this winter,\" Timmermans, who was speaking to CNBC's Silvia Amaro at an event in Bali, Indonesia, said. He also stressed the importance of member states being \"in a position to address the issue of windfall profits, if necessary.\" \"So we'll try everything to make sure that our energy markets are functioning, and are functioning in a way that addresses the issues that we need to tackle.\" Timmermans was asked if \"doing everything\" meant the EU agreeing, in the short term, to imposing caps on the price of gas and electricity. \"Well, nothing's off the table right now,\" he replied. \"We're preparing all of that, but we have to make sure that what we do doesn't create more damage than it helps us address the issue.\" \"So we have to be extremely careful. It took us 30 years to build the energy markets, so we need to make sure we address today's issue without creating long term problems.\""},

Already reeling from an economic crisis, flood waters have submerged over one third of the country in water, killing over 1,000 and impacting 33 million people. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the country's foreign minister, told CNBC's Dan Murphy Thursday that he fears the damages from the natural disaster will exceed current estimates of $10 billion, adding that the crisis in the country is still ongoing and in the \"rescue and relief phase.\" The flooding, which Bhutto Zardari told CNBC is \"a climate disaster of biblical proportions,\" covers over 95,000 square miles of land. Bhutto Zardari said the crisis is far from over, as \"southern areas of Pakistan are still bracing themselves for the flooding to come through the rivers from the north.\" \"Pakistan at this point in time, are paying in their lives and in their livelihoods for a climate disaster that is not of their making,\" he said. Pakistan's contribution to global carbon emissions is less than 1%, but it's among the 10 most affected countries in the world by climate change. The South Asian nation of over 220 million people reported a 27% inflation rate for August, according to government data, and was hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. Its currency has tanked while net foreign reserves have dwindled to just $8 billion in August, according to the State Bank of Pakistan. Political infighting has gripped the country since April, after the ousting of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who has been charged under anti-terror laws by Pakistan's police. Rural areas in Pakistan have been hit the hardest by flooding, which will have a compounded impact on Pakistan's farming industry, and ultimately the cost of food. Bhutto Zardari told CNBC \"about 80 to 90%\" of Pakistan's crops have been damaged by the floods. The International Rescue Committee report that 4 million acres of crops have been destroyed with 800,000 livestock perishing. Prior to the disaster, food inflation in rural provinces was much higher compared to urban areas. For instance, the cost of onions in Pakistan's urban areas increased by 89% from July 2021 to July 2022. In rural areas, that cost increase topped 100%. The International Monetary Fund on Monday approved the release of $1.1 billion to Pakistan in special drawing rights, a part of its bailout program which began in 2019. The money was already part of a relief program to help Pakistan stabilize its economy. Pakistan has now launched a joint appeal with the United Nations for about $160 million, which Bhutto Zardari told CNBC \"is obviously a very conservative estimate about the bare minimum requirements at this moment.\" Over a million homes have been destroyed, and Bhutto Zardari added that key infrastructure like bridges, road networks, and dams have been damaged. Pakistan going forward, he says, will need \"large scale reconstruction, which will require a lot of work.\""},

Lindsey Graham bid to quash subpoena in Trump Georgia election probe, but puts limit on questions", "paragraphs": " A federal judge on Thursday denied Sen. Lindsey Graham's latest effort to fully quash a subpoena for his testimony before a special grand jury in Georgia as part of its probe into possible criminal election interference by former President Donald Trump and his allies in 2020. But the judge also limited the scope of the subpoena by ordering that Graham, a South Carolina Republican and close Trump ally, cannot be asked about his \"investigatory fact-finding on telephone calls to Georgia election officials\" during his testimony. She was referring to phone calls Graham made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and his staff in the weeks after the November 2020 election between Trump and President Joe Biden. Graham's lawyers have argued that those calls were \"quintessentially legislative factfinding\" by a sitting U.S. senator, and as such are protected by the speech and debate clause of the Constitution. That off-limits topic includes how the information he gathered \"related to his decision to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election,\" the judge ruled. \"The Court finds that this area of inquiry falls under the protection of the Speech or Debate Clause, which prohibits questions on legislative activity,\" Judge Leigh Martin May wrote in Thursday's order in U.S. District Court in Atlanta. But May rejected Graham's other arguments to either throw out the subpoena or sharply limit the questions that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' office can ask him. \"As to the other categories, the Court finds that they are not legislative, and the Speech or Debate Clause does not apply to them,\" May wrote. \"As such, Senator Graham may be questioned about any alleged efforts to encourage Secretary Raffensperger or others to throw out ballots or otherwise alter Georgia's election practices and procedures,\" the judge ordered. \"Likewise, the grand jury may inquire into Senator Graham's alleged communications and coordination with the Trump Campaign and its post-election efforts in Georgia, as well as into Senator Graham's public statements related to Georgia's 2020 elections,\" May wrote. Graham's challenge now goes back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, where the senator filed an appeal after a previous ruling from Judge May denying his bid to quash the subpoena. \"We are pleased that the district court recognized that Senator Graham's testimony is protected by the Speech or Debate Clause,\" Graham's office said in a statement later Thursday. \"He will continue to defend the institutional interests of the Senate and the Constitution before the Eleventh Circuit.\" The order for Graham's testimony in Georgia's probe came one day after John Eastman, a pro-Trump lawyer who worked to overturn Biden's presidential victory, appeared before the grand jury and refused to answer questions. Eastman invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, as well as protections under attorney-client privilege, in refusing to answer at least some questions he was asked before the grand jury, his attorneys said. Rudy Giuliani, Trump's former personal attorney who was a leading voice challenging the 2020 election results, also recently testified before the grand jury."},

Speaking to CNBC at the Ambrosetti Forum in Italy, Ferguson said the catalyst events had already occurred to spark a repeat of the 70s, a period characterized by financial shocks, political clashes and civil unrest. Yet this time, the severity of those shocks was likely to be greater and more sustained. \"The ingredients of the 1970s are already in place,\" Ferguson, Milbank Family Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick. \"The monetary and fiscal policy mistakes of last year, which set this inflation off, are very alike to the 60s,\" he said, likening recent price hikes to the 1970's doggedly high inflation. \"And, as in 1973, you get a war,\" he continued, referring to the 1973 Arab-Israeli War \u2014 also known as the Yom Kippur War \u2014 between Israel and a coalition of Arab states led by Egypt and Syria. As with Russia's current war in Ukraine, the 1973 Arab-Israeli War led to international involvement from then-superpowers the Soviet Union and the U.S., sparking a wider energy crisis. Only that time, the conflict lasted just 20 days. Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has now entered into its sixth month, suggesting that any repercussions for energy markets could be far worse. \"This war is lasting much longer than the 1973 war, so the energy shock it is causing is actually going to be more sustained,\" said Ferguson. Politicians and central bankers have been vying to mitigate the worst effects of the fallout, by raising interest rates to combat inflation and reducing reliance on Russian energy imports. But Ferguson, who has authored 16 books, including his most recent \"Doom: The Politics of Catastrophe,\" said there was no evidence to suggest that current crises could be avoided. \"Why shouldn't it be as bad as the 1970s?\" he said. \"I'm going to go out on a limb: Let's consider the possibility that the 2020s could actually be worse than the 1970s.\" Among the reasons for that, he said, were currently lower productivity growth, higher debt levels and less favorable demographics now versus 50 years ago. \"At least in the 1970s you had detente between superpowers. I don't see much detente between Washington and Beijing right now. In fact, I see the opposite,\" he said, referring to recent clashes over Taiwan. Humans like to believe that global shocks happen with some degree of order or predictability. But that, Ferguson said, is a fallacy. In fact, rather than being evenly spread throughout history, like a bell curve, disasters tend to happen non-linearly and all at once, he said. \"The distributions in history really aren't normal, particularly when it comes to things like wars and financial crises or, for that matter, pandemics,\" said Ferguson. \"You start with a plague \u2014 or something we don't see very often, a really large global pandemic \u2014 which kills millions of people and disrupts the economy in all kinds of ways. Then you hit it with a big monetary and fiscal policy shock. And then you add the geopolitical shock.\" That miscalculation leads humans to be overly optimistic and, ultimately, unprepared to handle major crises, he said. \"In their heads, the world is kind of a bunch of averages, and there aren't likely to be really bad outcomes. This leads people ... to be somewhat overoptimistic,\" he said. As an example, Ferguson said he surveyed attendees at Ambrosetti \u2014 a forum in Italy attended by political leaders and the business elite \u2014 and found low single-digit percentages expect to see a decline in investment in Italy over the coming months. \"This is a country that's heading towards a recession,\" he said."},

It represents yet another example of beverage companies blurring the lines between drink categories, seeking to leverage existing brand loyalty while entering fast-growing categories. Gatorade's parent company, PepsiCo, has already expanded Mountain Dew into alcoholic and energy drinks. The company says Fast Twitch is designed to give athletes an extra boost before their workouts. The market for preworkout powders is growing, fueled by industry leaders such as Cellucor C4 and RSP Nutrition. But few preworkout drinks exist, and many consumers instead turn to carbonated, sugary energy drinks. Anuj Bhasin, general manager of Gatorade, said roughly 32 million consumers reject the energy drink category for the negative health effects. Fast Twitch aims to attract those consumers, offering plenty of caffeine but no sugar or carbonation. The new drink is slated to launch in February, but NFL players will be drinking it on sidelines during the upcoming season as part of an exclusive deal with the league. Bhasin said Gatorade worked with the NFL and its sports performance experts to develop the specific formula. The finished product comes in a petite 12-ounce bottle with brightly colored packaging. While smaller, it tastes pretty similar to traditional Gatorade. A bottle of Fast Twitch contains electrolytes, B-vitamins and 200 milligrams of caffeine. For comparison, a 12-ounce can of Red Bull has nearly half as much caffeine but 37 grams of sugar. Bolt24, another recent offshoot of Gatorade, has just 75 milligrams of caffeine in its Energize line, which is being phased out. \"Two hundred milligrams is the right amount to help athletes seeking benefits for exercise performance,\" said Matthew Pahnke, senior principal scientist at the Gatorade Sports Science Institute. Since its creation nearly six decades ago, Gatorade has built its brand on hydration, spreading the word about the benefits of electrolytes and carbohydrates. But caffeine is a natural diuretic, removing salt and water from the body. As a result, Fast Twitch is meant to precede drinking a more hydrating beverage during an actual workout, the company says. \"We know athletes will mix and match things,\" Pahnke said. Fast Twitch will target consumers who are 18 years old or older due to the high caffeine content, according to Bhasin. Fast Twitch follows a broader push by Pepsi into energy drinks. Over the last three years, the company bought Rockstar Energy for $3.85 billion, launched Mtn Dew Rise Energy with the endorsement of NBA superstar Lebron James and acquired a minority stake in up-and-coming energy drink maker Celsius for $550 million. Celsius is a potential competitor for Fast Twitch. The upstart markets its beverages as \"fitness drinks,\" and its marketing shows models swinging kettle bells and stretching. Another challenger also has ties to Gatorade's parent company. Bang Energy, which recently ended an acrimonious distribution deal with Pepsi, markets itself as a preworkout or recovery drink. Beyond being highly caffeinated, it touts \"super creatine,\" which claims to boost muscle performance, but no sugar. But Pepsi is already the dominant leader in the U.S. sports drink category, holding 73.2% market share with Gatorade and G Zero, according to Euromonitor International data. Bodyarmor jumped to second place in 2021 with 11.7% market share, overtaking Coca-Cola 's Powerade. Coke purchased full control of Bodyarmor in November for $5.6 billion in a play to increase its market share. Changing consumer tastes led to slowing sales growth for the sports drink market, even as U.S. adults exercise more. Years of backlash from lawmakers and pediatricians about sports drinks' high sugar and calorie counts didn't help either. But Gatorade staged a comeback, focusing on options with more electrolytes and less sugar, such as recent spin-offs G Fit, Gatorlyte and Bolt24. In the second quarter, Pepsi reported double-digit revenue growth for the Gatorade brand. However, not all of Gatorade's innovations have paid off. An organic version of the drink released in 2016 failed to take off and was discontinued several years later. Energy represents an opportunity in a fast-growing segment, but it lacks trust from consumers who exercise. Gatorade, on the other hand, has earned plenty of trust from that customer base. \"We found this to be the sweet spot of bringing a new brand to market, with the distinction of being from the makers of Gatorade, much like Propel,\" Bhasin said."},

The company also raised its outlook for the year. Shares rose about 9% in off-hours trading. Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv: Same store sales grew 23%, which beat StreetAccount's estimate of 17.6%. Net sales rose 29% to $1.87 billion. The company said that traffic remains strong both in stores and online, even as surging inflation cramps consumers' spending. Lululemon has a higher-income customer base that seems mostly unfettered by inflationary pressures. Still, other higher-end retailers like Nordstrom and Macy's slashed their outlook this quarter on fears of slowing demand. Lululemon, on the other hand, has boosted its guidance in two consecutive quarters. \"Despite the challenges around us in the macro-environment, guest traffic in our stores and on our e-commerce sites remains robust, which speaks to the strength of our multi-dimensional operating model,\" Chief Financial Officer Meghan Frank said in a news release. Store traffic increased over 30%, and ecommerce traffic rose over 40%, executives said on the earnings call Thursday. The company is hoping to boost customer loyalty with a soon-to-launch membership program. The membership program was announced at the end of the first quarter. It has a free tier and a $39 per month paid tier which give subscribers early access to product drops and exclusive items, as well as invitations to in-person events. The company said the traffic increases were not attributable to promotional programs or product markdowns. \"We have not changed our promotional cadence,\" CEO Calvin McDonald said on the earnings call. \"We have no plans to do so.\" Lululemon continued brick-and-mortar expansion during the quarter, with 21 net new stores for a total of 600 locations. Inventories were up 85% to $1.5 billion compared to the same period last year, but the company said it was \"under-inventoried\" at the time due to supply chain bottlenecks. Retailers in general have had to contend with swelling inventory levels as shoppers adjust their spending habits. Lululemon said Thursday it is confident the inventory level will help it boost sales during the holiday shopping season. The company said it now expects 2022 revenue of between $7.865 billion and $7.940 billion, up from the range of $7.610 billion to $7.710 billion it stated last quarter. The company also raised its adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $9.75 to $9.90, from last quarter's guidance of $9.35 to $9.50 adjusted. The release also maintained the company's long-term outlook of doubling net revenue to $12.5 billion from from 2021 to 2026. The plan includes an expansion of its menswear business, footwear, and membership-based fitness classes. Upon the plan's announcement in the spring, some analysts were skeptical about Lululemon's ability to achieve the lofty longer-term target. Lululemon touted some early success with the plan. It launched new shoes during the quarter, while its men's business saw 27% growth. The company also reported growth across all of the countries in which stores are currently active.

The city's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection said the case marks its first lawsuit for a violation of New York City's \"just cause\" protections for fast-food workers. Austin Locke, a longtime barista and union organizer, was fired less than a month after he and his coworkers voted to unionize a Starbucks in Queens, according to the lawsuit. The store is one of dozens of Starbucks locations that have voted to unionize. Starbucks had said that Locke was fired for failing to fill out a Covid-19 questionnaire and falsely reporting that a supervisor made physical contact with him, according to the city's lawsuit. The missteps were reportedly confirmed by surveillance footage, but the suit states that Locke's district and store manager did not let him see that footage. Locke's shifts were canceled, and he filed a complaint to the city days later. \"We do not comment on pending litigation,\" a Starbucks representative wrote to CNBC. \"However, we do intend to defend against the alleged violations of the New York City Just Cause Law.\" Under the city's Fair Workweek law, it is illegal to fire workers who have completed a 30 day probation or reduce their hours by more than 15% without just cause or an economic justification. The city is suing to get Locke reinstated and to win him restitution and back pay, which the city says will continue to accrue until Locke returns to his job. \"It's been a year since the campaign with Starbucks Workers United began at a Starbucks in Buffalo, NY,\" said Austin Locke in a statement released by the city. \"There are now 235 unionized Starbucks around the country. Starbucks continues to wrongfully fire pro-union workers nationwide in retaliation for union organizing.\" Starbucks has seen a wave of stores unionize across the country, and organizers have brought claims of retaliation by the company. Howard Schultz returned to the company as interim CEO amid the labor push, and has said he wants to reinvent the employee, customer and store experience to better reflect how the world has changed since the pandemic.

The fast-food giant ended the offering during the early days of pandemic lockdowns as part of a broader scheme to simplify service. Bloated menus can overwhelm customers, slow down kitchen operations and lead to longer drive-thru lines. Many U.S. franchisees cheered the decision, but customers have been asking the company's Twitter account about when all-day breakfast will return. A Twitter user revived the conversation on Thursday, tweeting a screenshot of a McDonald's press release that said all-day breakfast would be served starting Oct. 6. But bad news for Egg McMuffin lovers: a McDonald's representative confirmed that the release is from 2015, when the chain created its all-day breakfast menu. Former CEO Steve Easterbrook launched the menu as part of a turnaround plan to revitalize the burger chain's sluggish sales, and the company credited the move for driving sales growth. But it looks unlikely that the all-day breakfast menu will return. Even before the pandemic, operators had been asking the company to whittle down all-day breakfast items to speed up service. As McDonald's management began looking to add menu items back after lockdowns ended, CEO Chris Kempczinski told analysts that his team was working with franchisees to make sure \"every item that we add earns its way back onto the menu.\" With franchisee relations at a low point now over disagreements to new ownership terms, bringing back all-day breakfast could further fuel tensions."},

Narasimhan will join the company in October before stepping into the top job in April, Starbucks announced late Thursday. He will succeed interim CEO Howard Schultz, who returned to the coffee giant for his third stint earlier this year. Schultz will stay on as an advisor and remain on the board. BTIG analyst Peter Saleh compared the structure to a co-CEO model in a note to clients. Now, all eyes are on Starbucks' investor day in Seattle on Sept. 13. \"Importantly, this hire removes a major overhang for [Starbucks] shares, with focus now shifting to the '22 Investor Day,\" Barclays analyst Jeffrey Bernstein wrote. The company is expected to unveil a reinvention plan that will bring bold changes to the chain and its cafes. Schultz has crafted the strategy and will remain heavily involved with its implementation. Previous Schultz departures have resulted in double-digit tumbles for Starbucks stock. When the company announced in late 2016 that then-Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson would replace Schultz, shares fell as much as 10% in extended trading. Johnson was a relative newcomer to the restaurant industry, joining Starbucks as COO after decades working in tech. But Wall Street doesn't seem very concerned about Starbucks' latest transition plan. When the company announced its incoming CEO Thursday evening, the stock fell less than 1% in extended trading. In a demonstration of investors' trust in Narasimhan, shares of his current employer, Lysol and Durex owner Reckitt, fell as much as 5.7% on Thursday after the surprise announcement of his departure later this month. \"Narasimhan joins from Reckitt where he has overseen a successful restructuring, likely invaluable experience for the reinvention Schultz clearly envisages for [Starbucks],\" Atlantic Equities analyst Edward Lewis said in a Friday note. Analysts focused on Narasimhan's global experience, which could strengthen Starbucks' sales in emerging markets. His previous roles included serving as head of PepsiCo's Latin America, Europe and sub-Saharan Africa operations. Narasimhan \"brings the right kind of fresh perspective, leadership capabilities and energy\" to take Starbucks to the next level, Jefferies analyst Andy Barish wrote."},

He'll join Starbucks in October, learning about the company and its reinvention plan, before assuming the top job in April. Until then, Howard Schultz will continue as interim CEO of the coffee chain he grew into a global giant. Schultz will remain on Starbucks' board after Narasimhan succeeds him. Schultz has been at the helm since April, when his handpicked successor Kevin Johnson retired after five years on the job. Schultz returned to the company as its interim CEO, earning just $1 for his salary. In the meantime, Schultz and the Starbucks board hunted for a long-term successor, with the intention of announcing the new CEO in the fall. (The coffee chain brought back the Pumpkin Spice Latte and other fall menu items on Tuesday.) Schultz has previously said that he wants to reinvent the employee, customer and store experience to reckon with how the world has changed since the pandemic. The company is holding an investor day on Sept. 13 in Seattle, where it's expected to unveil more details about the bold changes it plans to make. Starbucks said in a news release that Schultz will remain \"closely involved\" with the plan and act as an advisor to Narasimhan. Narasimhan previously worked at PepsiCo, serving as its global chief commercial officer among other roles. Prior to working at the food and beverage giant, he was a senior partner at McKinsey. As CEO, he'll have to tackle a number of challenges. In its home market, Starbucks is facing a union push, with more than 200 stores in the U.S. voting to organize under Workers United. The battle has resulted in negative headlines and legal battles. Inflation hasn't hurt sales yet, but it has pushed menu prices higher. And China, its second-largest market, is struggling to bounce back from the pandemic, hampered by the country's zero Covid policy. \"His deep, hands-on experience driving strategic transformations at global consumer-facing businesses makes him the ideal choice to accelerate Starbucks growth and capture the opportunities ahead of us,\" Starbucks board chair Mellody Hobson said in a statement."},

All of Buick's roughly 2,000 U.S. franchise dealers will be given the opportunity to take a buyout, Duncan Aldred, global head of Buick, told The Wall Street Journal. \"Not everyone necessarily wants to make that journey, depending on where they're located or the level of expenditure that the transition will demand,\" he told the publication. \"So if they want to exit the Buick franchise, then we will give them monetary assistance to do so.\" Michelle Malcho, a company spokeswoman, on Friday confirmed the buyout plans to CNBC but declined to disclose the expected cost or how many dealers GM anticipates will take the offer. Many Buick dealers also sell GMC vehicles or another one of GM's U.S. brands. The company offered similar buyouts to Cadillac dealers in 2020. About 320 of those 880 retailers accepted the offer rather than assume expectations to invest at least $200,000 toward upgrading dealerships for electric vehicles. Buyout offers for Cadillac dealers ranged from about $300,000 to more than $1 million, a person familiar with the plans previously told CNBC.

The average home sold for less than its list price for the first time in over 17 months during the four-week period ended Aug. 28, according to a report by Redfin. Homes are simply not selling at the breakneck pace they were six months ago, when strong demand butted up against tight supply, bidding wars were the norm, and a seller could often get a signed contract in under a weekend. Homes in August sat on the market an average five days longer than they did a year ago \u2014 the first annual increase in time on the market in more than two years.

But Comcast executives are planning on Disney buying them out \u2014 even if they'd prefer otherwise. Disney owns two-thirds of Hulu and has an option to buy the remaining 33% from Comcast as early as January 2024. Some analysts and industry watchers have speculated Comcast might try to buy Hulu from Disney rather than the other way around. Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts has been a long-time believer in Hulu and has historically pushed to keep the asset rather than sell, including in 2013, when Roberts nixed talks with DirecTV, according to people familiar with the matter. Comcast broached the idea of buying all of Hulu from Disney after Disney agreed to acquire the majority of Fox's assets as part of a $71 billion deal that closed in early 2019, said two of the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private. Disney, armed with 66% ownership after acquiring Fox's minority stake in Hulu, dismissed the idea, the people said. Blocked from buying all of Hulu, Comcast's sustained belief in the business led to the unusual agreement the two companies reached in May 2019, with Comcast agreeing to sell Disney its minority stake as early as 2024. As part of that transaction, Disney guaranteed a sale price valuing Hulu at a minimum of $27.5 billion. That amount spiked earlier in the pandemic, giving Comcast some hope that Disney may choose to unload Hulu rather than pay Comcast a huge check for the remainder, two of the people said. Offloading Hulu would have allowed Disney to put its focus and money primarily on Disney+. \"I think if Disney could roll back the clock today, I'm not so sure they would enter into that deal,\" said Neil Begley, an analyst for Moody's Investors Services. \"Disney has this huge bill to pay in 2024 at a time when they're already investing a lot of money into Disney+.\" Acquiring Hulu from Disney would also supercharge Comcast's streaming efforts. Hulu would instantly become Comcast's flagship streaming asset, replacing NBCUniversal's Peacock, which has added just 13 million paid subscribers in its nearly two years of existence. Hulu has 46.2 million subscribers. Peacock could live on as NBCUniversal's free advertising-supported option. Peacock already has a free tier, with millions of users. Several top Comcast executives also think Hulu doesn't make as much sense paired with Disney's assets as it would at NBCUniversal, especially with the recent announcement that Disney+ plans to launch an advertising-supported tier in December, according to people familiar with the matter. Hulu has been Disney's advertising-supported service for years. Disney could have positioned Hulu as its advertising play going forward, but CEO Bob Chapek has chosen to make versions of both Disney+ and Hulu with and without commercials. Spokespeople for Disney and Comcast declined to comment. Netflix's slowing growth this year has led to an overall devaluation in the streaming sector. Comcast executives value Hulu \"significantly higher\" than $27.5 billion, and possibly up to $50 billion, one of the people said. That's down from around $60 billion during the pandemic, the person said. If Disney sticks to its plan to buy out Comcast by January 2024, there's still time for significant valuation fluctuations. Disney's decision to lower Disney+'s 2024 guidance and its subsequent move to raise prices signaled to Wall Street that Chapek is no longer focused on adding subscribers at all costs. It's sent a signal to Comcast that Hulu is likely in Disney's long-term plans. Excluding Hulu with Live TV, Hulu's average revenue per user is $12.92 per month. That's nearly triple Disney+'s global ARPU of $4.35 and more than double Disney+'s ARPU in the U.S. and Canada ($6.27). Disney has built a streaming strategy around bundling Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+. While Disney raised Disney+'s price by 38% and ESPN+'s price by 43%, it only bumped its bundled offering of Disney+, Hulu (with ads) and ESPN+ by $1, from $13.99 to $14.99. That suggests Disney's most preferred option is customers pay for the entire bundle, including Hulu. Media and entertainment companies have begun focusing on building profitable subscribers, rather than simply acquiring subscribers, in recent months as industrywide streaming growth has slowed. If Disney isn't trading on Disney+ growth, Hulu becomes a more important part of its long-term strategy. \"People are getting more judicious about their spend,\" Kevin Mayer, Disney's former head of streaming, said on CNBC last month. \"There's a renewed emphasis from Wall Street not just on the topline subscriber number but on the bottom line. I think that's healthy.\" There's also the issue of competitive dynamics. A primary reason Disney held on to Hulu, and acquired other Fox assets, was specifically to keep them from Comcast, according to people familiar with the matter. Handing Hulu to Comcast would alter the balance of power in the media world and weaken Disney, then-CEO Bob Iger thought, the people said. Comcast has already taken steps to weaken Hulu, assuming Disney will keep it. Earlier this year, Comcast made the decision to remove content such as \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Voice\" from the streaming service and put it on Peacock instead. That change takes place later this month. Comcast has already earmarked some of the proceeds it'll receive toward paying down debt. Comcast executives say they don't need the cash and aren't independently looking to accelerate a timeline, two of the people said. Activist investor Dan Loeb's Third Point Capital bought a new stake in Disney last month, arguing Disney should not only complete its deal for Hulu, it should accelerate its timing. \"We urge the company to make every attempt to acquire Comcast's remaining minority stake prior to the contractual deadline in early 2024,\" Loeb said in a letter addressed to Chapek. \"We believe that it would even be prudent for Disney to pay a modest premium to accelerate the integration but are cognizant that the seller may have an unreasonable price expectation at this time (while noting the seller has already made the decision to prematurely remove their own content from the platform.) We know this is a priority for you and hope there is a deal to be had before Comcast is contractually obligated to do so in about 18 months.\" Disney hasn't publicly addressed the specifics of Loeb's requests and hasn't made a decision on whether it plans to speed up a timeline to buy Comcast's stake in Hulu, according to people familiar with the matter.

The food and beverage company filed in November to go public on the Nasdaq Exchange using the ticker \"CHO.\" Reuters reported the yogurt maker was seeking a valuation of more than $10 billion. But it's been a rocky year for the stock market, leading to a drought of IPOs. In the second quarter, there were just 41 initial public offerings in the Americas, down 73% from the year-earlier period, according to a recent EY report. Chobani joins payroll vendor Justworks, grocer Fresh Market and file-sharing company WeTransfer in canceling its IPO this year. In an emailed statement, Chobani cited current market conditions for the withdrawal. \"Our focus remains on strong execution and driving profitable growth, and we continue to be excited about the future of Chobani,\" the statement said. In recent years, Chobani has expanded its product portfolio beyond Greek yogurt, adding oat milk, coffee creamers, cold brew coffee and yogurt drinks to its roster. In its IPO filing, the company said its revenue grew 5.2% to $1.4 billion from 2019 to 2020. However, its net loss more than tripled during that time, reaching $58.7 million, as it invested back into its business. Chobani said it planned to use a portion of the proceeds from the IPO to pay down debt. The company also said it would reorganize its corporate structure as part of the process. In March, amid delays to its IPO, Chobani' s then-operating chief Peter McGuinness left for Impossible Foods, where he now serves as chief executive. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in a statement that the departures of top leaders like McGuinness have cast a shadow over Chobani, despite its strong sales growth. \"This has given the impression of serious disagreements at the top which is not exactly the message a business looking to go public wants to impart,\" he said."},

The G-7 economic powers announced Friday that they had agreed on a plan to impose a set price on Russian oil. The initiative is the latest attempt to apply economic pressure on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. But aside from cutting Russia's oil revenues \u2014 a key source of funding for President Vladimir Putin's war chest \u2014 Le Maire said the policy should be implemented as a \"global measure against war.\" \"You need an outreach because we don't want this measure to be only a Western measure,\" Le Maire told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick at the Ambrosetti Forum in Italy. \"It should not be a Western measure against Russia, it should be a global measure against war,\" he added. The G-7 \u2014 which consists of the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, the U.K., Italy and Japan \u2014 is yet to finalize how the price cap will be implemented, a process that Le Maire acknowledged will be \"quite difficult.\" However, it is expected to be ready before early December when EU sanctions on seaborne imports of Russian crude kick in. \"We know that we need the unity from all the 27 member states if you want to get the green light for introducing that cap,\" he said, referring to the EU bloc of nations, a non-enumerated member of the G-7. More than that, however, Le Maire said the policy would require participation by other major global economies. It follows comments from Kadri Simson, the EU's energy chief, who urged involvement from China and India, both of which have increased their purchases of Russian oil this year, benefiting from discounted rates. \"If we want to be efficient in these sanctions, we need to reduce the revenues that Russia is gaining from oil and gas selling,\" Le Maire said. Russia has previously said it will not sell oil to nations that impose a price limit. And following the G-7's announcement on Friday, Russia's state-owned energy giant Gazprom said it would not restart gas flows via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline due to technical issues. It came after gas supplies were already halted last week for a planned \"maintenance outage\" that was expected to last until Sept. 3. Paolo Gentiloni, the EU's economics commissioner, said Saturday that the bloc was \"ready to react\" to Russia's decision to stop gas supplies to the region. France's Le Maire said separately that Europe's steadfast opposition to Russia, namely via economic sanctions and international diplomacy, was evidence of the region's rising status as a \"third global superpower.\" \"Things are radically changing. Europe is becoming a superpower, not only from an economic point of view but also a political point of view,\" Le Maire said. \"I really think that we are moving on the right direction to have Europe playing a part in the 21 st century between China and the United States,\" he added."},

Bartiromo, the anchor of Fox programs \"Mornings with Maria\" and \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" is slated to appear for a deposition on Sept. 8, according to court filings. In recent days, Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson and Jeanine Pirro were among the network hosts scheduled to appear for questioning in Dominion's lawsuit, which is seeking $1.6 billion in damages from the cable news network. Dominion has argued that Fox Corp. 's Fox News and Fox Business made false claims that its voting machines rigged the results of the 2020 election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Top brass Rupert Murdoch and Lachlan Murdoch are also expected to be deposed since the parent company has been sued, too. The case is being closely watched by First Amendment experts and advocates in part because of Dominion's lengthy list of examples that Fox network hosts repeatedly made false claims, even after the facts came to light. Libel lawsuits are often centered around one falsehood, and media companies are broadly protected by the First Amendment. Such cases are usually settled out of court or dismissed quickly by a court judge, experts say. But in December, the Delaware judge overseeing the Dominion case denied Fox News' request to have the case dismissed. Neither side has shown signs of entering discussions or reaching a settlement, according to people familiar with the matter, although that could change before the trial's expected start in April. Fox has vigorously denied the claims. \"Fox has put forth a First Amendment argument that this defamation case is aimed at punishing their speech and journalism, and this is an important component of their argument,\" said Roy Gutterman, an expert on communications law and free speech at Syracuse University's Newhouse School of Public Communications. But Gutterman said those rights can be limited \"by the concept of falsity, especially if it can bring harm to an individual or business.\" The depositions are private, as are the documents that Dominion has been collecting through the discovery process. Fox has asked the court to keep all of the collected materials private, claiming that Dominion mischaracterized what the documents show as actual malice. In court papers, Dominion has pointed to the rhetoric of hosts like Bartiromo, a former CNBC anchor, and former host Lou Dobbs and that they continued to feature guests \u2013 including Trump attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Sydney Powell \u2013 who made false claims that voter fraud was the reason Trump didn't surpass Biden to win the 2020 election. Dobbs was also previously scheduled for questioning, filings show. \"Fox, one of the most powerful media companies in the United States, gave life to a manufactured storyline about election fraud that cast a then-little-known voting machine company called Dominion as the villain,\" the company said in its initial court filing in March 2021. Fox News' legal team recently added veteran trial attorney Dan Webb to its roster. Webb told the Washington Post earlier this week that Fox News was only reporting on the news and claims being made by Trump's allies. \"We are confident we will prevail as freedom of the press is foundational to our democracy and must be protected, in addition to the damages claims being outrageous, unsupported and not rooting in sound financial analysis, serving as nothing more than a flagrant attempt to deter our journalists from doing their jobs,\" a Fox News spokesperson said in a statement. To win a defamation case, a plaintiff needs to show that the individual or business they're suing made false statements that caused harm, and that it acted with \"actual malice,\" meaning the speaker knew or should have known what they were saying wasn't true. \"A key issue in these depositions will be the state of mind of Fox as embodied by the journalists covering this or commenting on it,\" said Floyd Abrams, a prominent First Amendment attorney. \"What will someone like Lou Dobbs say? Will he say he believed what he was saying beyond simple reportage?\" Dominion said in court papers that it repeatedly sent emails to notify Fox News that its anchors and their guests were making false claims \u2013 and that Dominion had \"independent fact-checkers, government officials and election security experts\" that quashed those claims. In November 2020, a Dominion representative appeared on a Fox News program to respond to the claims of voter fraud by Trump and his allies. Other current and former Fox News executives have been called on for depositions, court filings show. Dominion has also filed lawsuits against the TV networks One America News and Newsmax. Another voting machine maker, Smartmatic USA, has made similar claims in a defamation lawsuit against Fox News that alleged Dobbs and other hosts falsely accused the company of helping to rig the election. A New York judge earlier this year denied Fox News' motion to dismiss the lawsuit. Shortly after Smartmatic filed its lawsuit, Fox News canceled Dobbs' weekday business show, \"Lou Dobbs Tonight.\" Fox has previously said the move to end Dobbs' program was in the works prior to the lawsuit."},

The VA previously did not provide abortion services, but it said in a news release that it considers access to medically necessary abortions \"essential for preserving the life and health of veterans and VA beneficiaries.\" In light of recent state-level abortion bans around the country after Roe v. Wade was overturned in June, it said it will preserve access by amending its regulations and providing abortions for beneficiaries \"on a case-by-case basis.\" The VA will also begin providing abortion counseling. Both changes also apply to eligible dependents enrolled in the agency's CHAMPVA program. \"This is a patient safety decision,\" said Denis McDonough, secretary of veterans affairs. \"Pregnant Veterans and VA beneficiaries deserve to have access to world-class reproductive care when they need it most. That's what our nation owes them, and that's what we at VA will deliver.\" The regulatory change will be effective as soon as the Federal Register publishes the change, which the VA submitted as an interim rule Thursday night. Once it is, the VA will \"immediately prepare to provide these services in as many locations as possible,\" the agency said in a news release. As federal employees, VA health care providers will be able to provide authorized services regardless of state restrictions, according to the agency. Decisions about if a pregnant person's \"life or health\" are endangered by a pregnancy will be made on a case-by-case basis by VA health care providers in consultation with patients. The VA will consider self-reporting of rape or incest as sufficient evidence in those cases, the agency said. These thresholds of medical necessity are \"in accordance with generally accepted standards of medical practice,\" said Dr. Shereef Elnahal, VA's undersecretary for health. \"We came to this decision after listening to VA health care providers and veterans across the country, who sounded the alarm that abortion restrictions are creating a medical emergency for those we serve.\" The VA excluded abortion coverage when it established its medical benefits package in 1999. While the agency did not provide an explanation for the exclusion, at the time, \"VA was aware that veterans of reproductive age enrolled in its health care system could access abortion services in their communities,\" according to background information provided with the new interim rule. After the Dobbs decision in June, that was no longer the case nationwide, prompting the agency to create exemptions to its exclusion. Once published, the interim rule will be available for public comment for 30 days. More information will be available on the VA's reproductive health website, under \"Abortion Services.\""},

Twitter shares were down more than 1% in premarket trade. The latest filings come after Twitter's former head of security, Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, earlier this month alleged\"extreme, egregious deficiencies\" by the social media company related to privacy, security and content moderation. On July 8, Musk 's legal team initially filed a notice with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to terminate the Twitter acquisition. Musk's team alleged that \"Twitter has not complied with its contractual obligations.\" The follow-up notice, disclosed to the SEC, cites allegations made by Zatko as additional reasons to terminate the deal. \"Allegations regarding certain facts, known to Twitter prior to and as of July 8, 2022, but undisclosed to the Musk Parties prior to and at that time, have since come to light that provide additional and distinct bases to terminate the Merger Agreement,\" Mike Ringler, Musk's legal representative from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, wrote in a letter to Twitter's legal chief, Vijaya Gadde. Ringler said in the letter that the latest termination notice is \"not legally necessary\" to end the merger deal, but is being delivered in case the July 8 filing is \"determined to be invalid for any reason.\" The letter on behalf of Musk said the Zatko complaint \"alleges far-reaching misconduct at Twitter\u2014all of which was disclosed to Twitter's directors and senior executives, including (CEO) Parag Agrawal\u2014that is likely to have severe consequences for Twitter's business.\" Musk's lawyer said Zatko alleges that Twitter is in \"material noncompliance\" with its obligations under its 2011 agreement with the Federal Trade Commission. The letter laid out some of Zatko's other allegations including claims that Twitter is \"uniquely vulnerable to systemic disruption resulting from data center failures or malicious actors,\" something senior management knew about but \"ignored and sought to obfuscate.\" \"These allegations, if true, demonstrate that Twitter has breached the following provisions of the Merger Agreement, thereby giving the Musk Parties the right to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms,\" the letter said. Twitter's legal team responded on Tuesday by sending a letter to Musk's legal representatives. Twitter said Musk's termination case is \"invalid and wrongful under\" the acquisition agreement. \"It is based solely on statements made by a third party that, as Twitter has previously stated, are riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lack important context,\" the letter written by William Savitt of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz law firm said. \"Contrary to the assertions in your letter, Twitter has breached none of its representations or obligations under the Agreement, and Twitter has not suffered and is not likely to suffer a Company Material Adverse Effect.\" Twitter said it intends to enforce the acquisition agreement and \"close the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon\" with Musk. Twitter's legal team said Musk's latest notice to terminate the deal is \"invalid for the independent reason that Mr. Musk and the other Musk Parties continue to knowingly, intentionally, willfully, and materially breach\" the acquisition agreement. The social media giant has previously responded to Zatko. In a memo to staff posted to Twitter on Aug. 23 by CNN correspondent Donie O'Sullivan, Agrawal described Zatko as \"a former Twitter executive who was terminated in January 2022 for ineffective leadership and poor performance.\" Zatko's attorneys issued a statement on Monday in response to that characterization, saying he \"put his career on the line because of his concerns about Twitter users, the public, and the company's shareholders.\" Twitter and Musk will go on trial on Oct. 17 in Delaware to resolve Musk's attempt to cancel his acquisition of the company unless they reach a settlement first. Since proposing the Twitter takeover, Musk has complained that the number of fake or spam accounts on the social media platform is higher than is being disclosed. In the July 8 letter, Musk's legal team claimed the company had \"failed or refused to provide\" information on these accounts to the Tesla CEO. Ahead of the October trial, Musk's legal team has subpoenaed Zatko, seeking information on the company's spam accounts and its alleged security vulnerabilities. \u2014 CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report."},

Trump Media and Technology Group and the SPAC have faced increasing scrutiny in recent months. A federal probe was launched into possible securities violations over the deal. Fox Business reported that Truth Social was in financial trouble and had failed to pay a vendor over $1 million in contractually obligated payments, an allegation which the company denied. DWAC itself warned shareholders that a decline in the ex-president's popularity could hurt the deal. Indeed, the vote comes amid a Justice Department criminal probe into whether Trump illegally removed thousands of White House documents, including those marked \"Top Secret\" and \"Classified,\" to his Mar-a-Lago private home after he left the presidency. Truth Social has faced its own scrutiny. The app was barred from the Google Play store for violating the store's policies regarding the moderation of user-generated content. The platform remains accessible online and on the Apple App Store. DWAC and Trump Media face a Thursday deadline to complete the merger, and the SPAC is eagerly seeking an extension. DWAC needs 65% of shareholders to approve the delay. Patrick Orlando, DWAC's CEO, has issued a barrage of pleas to shareholders through various channels, including Truth Social, urging them to approve the extension. Non-votes are essentially counted as \"no\" votes. Some of the SPACs institutional investors, including Lighthouse Investment Partners and Pentwater Capital Management, didn't comment on the upcoming vote when reached by CNBC. Citadel Investment Group said the company is holding stock as a \"market maker,\" not as a voting shareholder. DWAC has warned previously that a \"no\" result could force DWAC into liquidation. The SPAC does, however, have built-in extensions of up to six months that can be initiated by sponsors adding money to the trust. Orlando's company, ARC Global Investments, holds 20% of these votes itself, he disclosed in an interview last Thursday with IPO Edge. Still, he said, \"the retail shareholder holds a lot of weight.\" Trump Media and Technology Group and Truth Social were founded after Trump was banned from Twitter following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. On that day, his supporters stormed the building in an attempt to prevent the certification of Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election. Trump Media announced in October 2021 that it would merge with DWAC to take the company public. Trump Media, headed by Republican former U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes, has said it also plans on launching TMTG News and TMTG+ video streaming services. The high-profile nature of the merger has brought in more retail investors than SPACs normally attract. The SPACs institutional investors largely did not respond to a request for comment. For investors, DWAC's liquidation would pay out around $10 per share. Shares of the so-called blank check company have traded around $25 of late. This is far from its 2022 peak of about $97 in March. Weak turnout in the shareholder vote could squash the deal. \"Let's #rocktheproxy,\" the Florida-based Orlando said in one of his many Truth Social posts during the voting period. \"Shooting for huge engagement and voter participation!!!!\" When questioned about probes into the DWAC-Trump Media deal, Orlando said that DWAC was \"aware of many targets\" prior to the offering, and that the company was complying with all probe requests. \"If there's an inquiry, we respond to the inquiry. If there's a procedure that we have to go through, we go through that procedure,\" Orlando said in the IPO Edge interview. The DWAC CEO also said Trump remained the chairman of Trump Media, countering reports that he left the board just weeks before the company was subpoenaed. Orlando reiterated the potential risks brought about by Trump's volatile public popularity. \"There's a risk factor. We need to let people know these are things you should think about,\" Orlando told IPO Edge. \"If certain events occur that are negative, they will negatively impact a stock.\" The results of the shareholder vote are expected to be announced Tuesday, barring a decision by the company to adjourn the meeting. \u2013 CNBC's Yun Li contributed to this report."},

Paramount and Skydance's \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" alongside Disney and Marvel Studio's \"Doctor Strange in the Mulitverse of Madness,\" reignited the movie theater business, driving million to theaters and racking up hundreds of million in ticket sales. The two films kicked off the summer movie season, which runs from May through August, and are the two top-grossing movies released domestically this year. However, with only a handful of major releases during the summer season, ticket sales dwindled in late July and fell throughout August. In fact, the box office generated less than $100 million in each of the last five weeks of the summer period, according to data from Comscore. \"It definitely ended on a whimper,\" said Shawn Robbins, chief media analyst at BoxOffice.com. Big franchises including Universal's\"Jurassic World: Dominion,\" \"Minions: The Rise of Gru\" and Disney's \"Thor: Love and Thunder\" lifted the box office, but without smaller and mid-tier budgeted films to fill the gaps, the summer box office failed to capitalize on its momentum. While audiences have returned to cinemas, and are spending more on premium tickets and popcorn, there are still lingering pandemic issues. Those issues include production shutdowns that delayed film shoots and pressure on visual effects houses to complete projects on shortened deadlines. This means that the movie calendar, while filling back up, is far from running on all cylinders. Over the summer, just 22 films were launched in theaters, down 47.6% compared to 2019, Comscore data shows. And this is a trend that's been seen all year long. From January to end of August in 2019, Hollywood released 75 films in cinemas. In 2022, so far, it's only released 46. There will be more month-to-month consistency next year, Robbins said. Despite nearly 50% fewer film releases during this four-month period, the domestic box still tallied $3.34 billion in ticket sales, down just 21% from 2019 levels. \"The results are impressive,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. \"Summer movies like 'Top Gun: Maverick,' 'Doctor Strange 2,' 'Jurassic World: Dominion,' and others, punched above their weight in May, June, and July, boosting not only sales, but confidence in the industry after moving in fits and starts over the course of 2020 and 2021.\" \"However, a fall slowdown has given the industry a bit of a post-summer hangover with worries that only a handful of apparent blockbusters wait in the wings to bolster the fortunes of the third quarter box office,\" he said. As it stands, there are currently only four would-be blockbuster releases coming to theaters before the end of December, including Warner Bros.' \"Black Adam\" in October, Disney's \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\" and \"Strange World\" in November, and Disney's \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" in December. For comparison, in 2019, there were nearly two dozen blockbuster-style films slated on the calendar for the last four months of the year, including \"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,\" \"Jumanji: The Next Level\" and \"Frozen II.\" The domestic box office has generated around $5.3 billion since January, down around 31% compared to 2019, but remains on pace to deliver around $7.5 billion in total ticket sales by the end of the year, Dergarabedian said. \"That's frankly a great outcome for an industry that saw 2020 levels at a mere $2.3 billion and a 2021 that wound up at $4.6 billion,\" he said. Next year looks stronger. Already the calendar has significantly more titles, as well as a more diverse collection of genres and budgets, including Marvel's \"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,\" \"Dungeons & Dragons\" and \"John Wick 4.\" \"2023 gets things rolling on a much better foot,\" Robbins said.

In a series of letters sent Tuesday morning, the committee asked four agencies, including the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Trade Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as five digital asset exchanges \u2014 Coinbase, FTX, Binance.US, Kraken, and KuCoin \u2014 for information and documents about what they are doing, if anything, to safeguard consumers against scams and combat cryptocurrency-related fraud. More than $1 billion in crypto has been lost to fraud since the start of 2021, according to research from the FTC. \"As stories of skyrocketing prices and overnight riches have attracted both professional and amateur investors to cryptocurrencies, scammers have cashed in,\" wrote Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D.-Ill., Chair of the Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy. \"The lack of a central authority to flag suspicious transactions in many situations, the irreversibility of transactions, and the limited understanding many consumers and investors have of the underlying technology make cryptocurrency a preferred transaction method for scammers.\" The letters ask that the federal agencies and crypto exchanges respond by Sept. 12 with information about what they are doing to protect consumers. The committee says that these responses could be used to craft legislative solutions. In particular, the letters ask that the exchanges produce documents dating back through Jan. 1, 2009, which display efforts to combat crypto scams and fraud, as well as show attempts made to \"identify, investigate, and remove or flag potentially fraudulent digital assets or accounts,\" as well as highlight discussions around \"whether to adopt more stringent policies.\" In one letter, addressed to Sam Bankman-Fried, the CEO and founder of FTX, the committee notes that \"while some exchanges review cryptocurrencies before listing them, others allow digital assets to be listed with little or no vetting.\" Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis found that 37% of crypto scam revenue last year went to \"rug pulls,\" a type of scheme that involves developers listing a token on an exchange, pumping it up, and then vanishing with the funds. Binance.US, which also received an inquiry from the committee on Tuesday, has been accused in a class action lawsuit of misleading consumers about the safety of investing in the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin known as terraUSD (or UST, for short) and its sister token, luna. At their height, luna and UST had a combined market value of almost $60 billion. Now, they're essentially worthless. Concern over the safety of crypto funds parked on centralized platforms has also been gaining traction following the recent collapse of Voyager Digital and Celsius, both popular apps among retail traders because of the double-digit annual percentage yield once offered by the two companies. The subsequent bankruptcies of these two platforms have highlighted the question of who owns cryptocurrency assets when a custodial business goes belly up. In the bankruptcy proceedings of both Voyager and Celsius, customers are considered unsecured creditors, rather than federally-insured bank depositors, meaning there is no guarantee they will get any of their money back. As for the relationship between investor and crypto exchange, the terms and conditions vary. In a financial filing released in May, Coinbase said its users would be treated as \"general unsecured creditors\" in the event of bankruptcy. Krishnamoorthi also noted that the agencies often seem to be acting at cross-purposes and giving inconsistent guidance to private-sector players. \"Without clear definitions and guidance, agencies will continue their infighting and will be unable effectively to implement consumer and investor protections related to cryptocurrencies and the exchanges on which they are traded.\""},

In an interview on \"Mad Money,\" Brown indicated Motorola's business remains resilient despite concerns of a slowing global economy because a major upgrade cycle is underway. \"What we do is a need to have, not a nice to have. This is the strongest demand environment I've ever seen,\" said Brown, who has led Motorola Solutions for more than a decade. Motorola makes two-way radios used by police and fire departments; security video systems; and command center software, among other things. Brown said Motorola Solutions stands to benefit from the Biden administration's $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill, which passed in 2021 and included dedicated funds for public safety investments. More generally, Brown told Jim Cramer there's a private-network radio upgrade cycle taking place that will boost the company's business in the years to come. \"Those radios refresh every seven years. And we're in the first or second inning radio refresh here in North America \u2014 so New York, Chicago, Las Vegas, L.A., they're Motorola,\" Brown said. \"The demand is the best, record backlog.

The Hangzhou, China-headquartered firm bought Quantic Dream, marking the establishment of its first fully owned gaming studio in Europe. NetEase and its rival Tencent have been upping their efforts overseas as the Chinese domestic games market slows down amid tighter regulation. Over the years, Tencent has been prolific in acquisitions and investments in overseas gaming companies. NetEase is now catching up. This year alone, NetEase has set up gaming studios in Japan and the U.S. NetEase has typically been focused on PC and mobile gaming, extremely popular formats in China. Mobile gaming makes up more than half of its global games revenues. But more recently, the tech giant has been expanding into console games. Quantic Dream, a 25-year-old studio, will focus \"on creating and publishing its video games on all platforms, as well as supporting and publishing third-party developed titles,\" according to a press release. That highlights NetEase's intention to grow across mobile, PC and consoles. The acquisition of Quantic Dream is in line with NetEase's strategy of acquiring well-known international characters and franchises. Quantic Dream is currently developing a game called Star Wars Eclipse, based on Disney's space adventure movies. NetEase has already released mobile games based on the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. NetEase's international push comes as regulators in China continue to scrutinize the games market, though there are signs of some easing. Last year, authorities restricted the amount of time those under 18 years old could play online games and froze the approval of new titles. In China, games need the green light from regulators to be released and monetized. Those approvals restarted in April. In an interview with CNBC last year, Hu Zhipeng, vice president at NetEase and one of the top bosses of the technology giant's video games business, said that he aims to eventually have 50% of the company's gaming revenue come from overseas, up from around 10% now. Competition in the global games market is heating up. Sony, a leader in console gaming and producer of the PlayStation, announced on Tuesday that it is setting up a dedicated mobile division, which will put it in competition with the likes of Chinese giants Tencent and NetEase."},

The lawsuit also names MicroStrategy as a defendant. Racine alleges the company conspired to help Saylor evade the taxes. The AG's office said it's seeking to recover a total sum of over $100 million in unpaid taxes and penalties. Shares of MicroStrategy were down more than 6% Wednesday afternoon on the news. Saylor, who oversaw the company's push into bitcoin, stepped down as CEO earlier this month. Under his leadership, MicroStrategy spent close to $4 billion acquiring bitcoin at an average price of $30,700, and he has said he considers the company's stock a sort of bitcoin ETF. Saylor allegedly claimed to reside in Virginia or Florida, which have lower or no personal income tax rates, while actually living in several different homes around D.C., including a penthouse apartment in the Georgetown neighborhood or on his yacht on the Georgetown waterfront or Potomac River when the apartment was undergoing renovations, according to the lawsuit. The suit includes several screenshots of posts that appear to be from Saylor's Facebook page dating back several years and referencing the view from his \"Georgetown balcony\" and discussing his \"home\" while tagging Washington, D.C. MicroStrategy allegedly \"had detailed information confirming that Saylor was in fact a DC resident,\" according to a press release, but it chose to withhold that information. In a statement, MicroStrategy said, \"The case is a personal tax matter involving Mr. Saylor. The Company was not responsible for his day-to-day affairs and did not oversee his individual tax responsibilities. Nor did the Company conspire with Mr. Saylor in the discharge of his personal tax responsibilities. The District of Columbia's claims against the Company are false and we will defend aggressively against this overreach.\" Around 2014, the AG's office claims in the lawsuit, MicroStrategy's then-chief financial officer confronted Saylor about his alleged tax evasion being a potential liability for the company. Saylor and MicroStrategy ended up reaching an agreement where Saylor's salary would be reduced to a nominal $1, the lawsuit claims, in order to reduce the risk authorities would discover the alleged scheme. Still, the AG alleges, Saylor continued to benefit from \"fringe benefits\" with a \"high cash value,\" such as use of the company plane. \"A decade ago, I bought an historic house in Miami Beach and moved my home there from Virginia,\" Saylor said in a statement. \"Although MicroStrategy is based in Virginia, Florida is where I live, vote, and have reported for jury duty, and it is at the center of my personal and family life. I respectfully disagree with the position of the District of Columbia, and look forward to a fair resolution in the courts.\" The suit is the first to be brought under a recently passed law called the False Claims Act, according to Racine's office. The district law incentivizes whistleblowers to report tax fraud and allows the court to impose penalties up to three times the amount of the evaded taxes, according to the AG's office. The district suit follows a separate complaint filed by whistleblowers against Saylor in April 2021, accusing him of failing to pay income taxes from 2014 through 2020. The complaint was filed under seal but made public on Wednesday. The AG's office said it independently investigated the whistleblower case and found MicroStrategy had filed inaccurate W-2s with his Florida-based address and had failed to withhold taxes allegedly owed to the district. The new lawsuit alleges Saylor failed to pay income tax he owed to the district starting in 2005. \u2014 MacKenzie Sigalos contributed to this story.

CEO Evan Spiegel announced the moves in a memo Tuesday, and told employees the company needs to restructure its business to deal with its financial challenges. He said the company's current year-over-year revenue growth rate for the quarter of 8% \"is well below what we were expecting earlier this year.\" \"While we have built substantial capital reserves, and have made extensive efforts to avoid reductions in the size of our team by reducing spend in other areas, we must now face the consequences of our lower revenue growth and adapt to the market environment,\" Spiegel said. \"We are restructuring our business to increase focus on our three strategic priorities: community growth, revenue growth, and augmented reality.\" Other projects the company nuked include its Snap Minis third-party apps and Snap Games. Spiegel said Snap is also starting the \"process of winding down\" its Zenly map product and Voisey music feature, which were both inherited through acquisitions. Snap has also promoted Jerry Hunter from senior vice president of engineering to chief operating officer. Hunter will continue leading Snap's engineering unit, Spiegel said. The company said it hired Ronan Harris, Google's vice president and managing director of U.K. and Ireland, to be its president of the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, a new position. Harris will join Snap's executive team. Spiegel said Snap is currently searching for presidents of the company's Asia-Pacific and Americas regions, also two new roles. \"Changes of this magnitude are never easy, and we must act decisively to meet this moment as a team,\" Spiegel said. \"I am proud of the strength and resilience of our team as we have navigated the myriad challenges of growing our business in a highly competitive industry during uncertain and unprecedented times.\" In July, Snap shares cratered more than 25% after the company reported second-quarter results that missed on both the top and bottom lines and said it would not provide guidance for its current quarter. The company said at the time that it planned to \"substantially\" slow its hiring rate and operating expense growth rate. Like other social media companies, including Facebook parent Meta, Pinterest and Twitter, Snap said a confluence of factors has simultaneously hurt the company's business. They include a weakening macroeconomic environment and Apple 's 2021 iOS update, which made it more difficult for social media companies to track users on behalf of third-party advertisers. The rise of TikTok's short-video service has also posed a significant challenge for Snap and its competitors. Snap said it was scrapping development of its Pixy drone after reports surfaced that the company was pausing its work on the device. The drone was supposed to be a fun way for users to take photos of themselves from multiple angles. Snap has been trying to build a consumer hardware business and announced the $230 drone in April."},
{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/01/for-industrial-cobot-its-been-a-decade-in-search-of-a-permanent-job-.html", "title": "A robot named Baxter wanted to change the world of work, but his career ended early", "paragraphs": " In this weekly series, CNBC takes a look at companies that made the inaugural Disruptor 50 list, 10 years later. One of the enduring lessons of the iPhone era is that Steve Jobs led with what the consumer didn't know they wanted until he showed it to them. Robotics pioneer Rodney Brooks has operated from a similar idea \u2014 with varying degrees of success. His robot vacuum cleaner Roomba, and its parent company iRobot, which more or less made the category of robotic vacuums an inexpensive, must-have for many consumers, was recently sold to Amazon for $1.7 billion. \"iRobot found a product-market fit. It had a feature set and a cost that lots and lots of people were willing to pay for, that puck-shaped thing that cleans the floor pretty well,\" said Matt Beane, an assistant professor in the technology management program at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and a robotics expert. But another of Brooks' big, early ideas, hasn't worked out the way he or the world imagined. Rethink Robotics was founded in 2008 with the idea that a cobot \u2014 a robot working alongside humans in ways that traditional automation couldn't (i.e. with much less danger to the human), and without the fencing that most industrial robots remained inside \u2014 was a market waiting to be made among industrial customers. But for all the novel ideas that Brooks and his Rethink colleagues brought to the table, its first cobot never caught on. It caught on in the press, for sure, and if you were following tech news at the beginning of the last decade you likely saw Baxter and \"his eyes\" staring out from the screen between his arms at some point in a photo or video footage. At CNBC, we learned firsthand the limitations of working with novel industrial robots when we invited Baxter on-air for a live segment as part of Rethink being named to the inaugural Disruptor 50 list in 2013. For technical reasons, it would have been a lot more difficult than we imagined to get Baxter onto the television studio set. While he may not be a part of the robotic future anymore, there is no history of the cobot that can be written without Baxter. \"There is no such thing as the cobot without Rod Brooks,\" Beane said. \"Rethink started the industry.\" After a lot of early fanfare, reality set in for Rethink. By 2018, it was struggling to scale its operations and find enough buyers for Baxter, with its two-armed design proving to be a novel idea, but a mistake. \"No one needs a two-armed robot,\" Beane said, describing that design decision as \"humans projecting onto a robot their own physical form.\" Rethink pivoted, in what turned out to be a move made too late, to a one-armed robot named Sawyer. But the technology had other problems. Rethink bet on an approach that used elastic actuators \u2014 a technology one of Brooks co-founders was an expert on \u2014 which allowed the robot to perform \"force sensing,\" an approach the company backed because it would make the robots safer around human coworkers. Rethink's design would also make the robots low cost, getting rid of standard industry reliance on motors and related parts. Paul Maeder, a mechanical engineer who invested early in Rethink through his VC firm, told the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in a post-mortem on Rethink that goes deep into the technical shortcomings, that cheaper parts plus force sensing seemed like the way to bring down pricing in the robotics market and appeal to customers. And it did bring down pricing. \"The reality is that they had a very low price point, shockingly low,\" Beane said. \"They had done an amazingly good job at materials sourcing and design, and they were headed to one-third or one-quarter of the price for other robots.\" But Rethink never achieved the market penetration or scale it needed to maintain its operations. As the financials worsened, Rethink became the acquisition target of a Chinese firm, a deal Beane says would have had a good shot at getting the firm to scale. But that deal was scuttled \"at the last moment,\" according to the company, and a 2018 bankruptcy followed. Rethink was bought out of bankruptcy by German automation company Hahn Group, which is still trying to make the technology a success today. In a statement provided to TechCrunch at the time of its demise, Rethink said, \"We were early to market with a very innovative product that was ahead of its time, and unfortunately, we did not achieve the commercial success we had expected.\" It's true Rethink had no shortage of interesting, innovative ideas, even if they weren't the right ones for the market. According to Beane, one of the most intriguing was the ability for the cobot to be programmed by the worker. \"People don't make much of this feature anymore, but that was a graphic user interface system which didn't require code and you could teach it, train it to do a job as the worker,\" Beane said. \"But no manager would turn those features on,\" he added. That's an idea that Brooks is still working on today, through his latest robotics startup Robust.ai, co-founded with cognitive scientist Gary Marcus, which is making a warehouse cobot, Carter, that is like a mobile shopping cart providing transport within fulfillment centers. \"It can drive in any direction and is worker programmable and can physically collaborate,\" Beane said. \"A lot of the same DNA is there.\" Once Sawyer became the lead cobot, Rethink invested in a technology that integrated the cobot with preexisting industrial automation, an interesting approach, but ultimately, another bottleneck that was costly in engineering time to connect and to get to communicate with machinery like conveyors. \"Just to alter the speed of a conveyor is extremely expensive,\" Beane said. The DNA that has become standard in the cobot market that Baxter, and later Sawyer, hoped to dominate, is from Rethink rival and Denmark-based Universal Robots. While its cobots may be \"very boring looking\" in Beane's view, they were what the market ultimately wanted. \"In the end, the series elastic actuators were probably not the best idea in the world,\" Maeder told ASME. \"What customers really want is a low-cost, simple, fast, repeatable robot. They want to put something in this exact location again, and again and again. In the end, that was a lot more complicated for us to achieve than for some of our competitors because they weren't trying to do force sensing.\" Even the two arms that Baxter had could always be purchased by a buyer if they really wanted that approach, by purchasing two single-arm robots, and that's what Universal Robots \u2014 which was acquired by industrial automation company Teradyne in 2015 \u2014 excels at, with its UR3, UR5 and UR7 cobots leading to increased sales, and successive generations of its cobot line continuing to hit the market. The opportunity for robotics technology remains significant, though it is still trailing other automation approaches in market penetration. Robot sales in the North American market have been growing, and the Teradyne unit led by Universal Robots is seeing steady, if not explosive, sales growth, too. Revenue was $300 million in 2019, and then increased to $376 million last year after a Covid dip. According to Wall Street estimates, sales could reach $440 million this year, or about 18% growth. That growth rate is higher than the percentage of overall revenue it represents, which is still under 15%. \"A lot more will occur,\" Beane said. \"Progress often looks slow up close ... but the utility of a robotic system that can accomplish general tasks at a reasonable cost is extraordinary, billions, maybe trillions worth of value,\" he added. And costs keep going down, from batteries to sensors and software, meaning the price performance for robots keeps going up steadily. But where the cobot finds its greatest utility remains an open question. While the industrial world use has been in the first decades often as much a marketing ploy or, at best, an experiment rather than proof of widespread adoption, there is reason to forecast multiple roles for cobots based on an aging demographic. \"Anyone who says not in my lifetime, you better hope it is in your lifetime, because you will need help,\" Beane said. He anticipates that jobs outside of the manufacturing sector with which cobots have been associated \u2014 from warehousing to retail, medical (think cobots bringing supplies to nurses) and retirement communities \u2014 are areas poised for growing use. \"Manufacturing is about high throughput and high consistency and you can automate the heck out of it without a cobot,\" Beane said. \"We're only just getting started on this capability being useful and used at scale.\" Rodney Brooks is among the robotics experts who has spoken about a world that is getting older and a working population that is not as strong. He wrote in a blog post covering his annual predictions that \"soon the houses of the elderly will be cluttered with too many robots.\" Wall Street analysts are focused on the opportunity presented by a chronic labor shortage, and related changes taking place in a global outsourcing paradigm which economies including the U.S. have been relying on for decades. With \"near shoring\" and onshoring of more manufacturing activity, there is increasing demand for labor in a tight labor market. One answer is automation, and technology like Universal Robots is relatively easy to program and implement. But one big issue the cobots have not yet solved is the same one that started Brooks down the Rethink path: figuring out what everyone wants from this technology, the \"killer app,\" so to speak, for the cobot. Universal Robots has many different applications for its technology, but not a single one that drives strong demand within one very high volume market. That's a solvable problem, but still a work in progress. Robots running popcorn stations in a movie theatre or robot cafe baristas aren't the career opportunity that takes the cobots to center stage in the economy. But there is a shortage of people and automation has to be one of the solutions, even if it doesn't happen by tomorrow. We have not reached a world of genuine physical collaboration between human worker and cobot, Beane says, \"the kind of stuff where humans reach over to grab the next thing and the robot sees I am reaching and hands it to me and we might even brush up against each other,\" but, \"We are getting there,\" he added. The automated systems that are most widely deployed remain the ones that are more dangerous and kept at a distance. But Beane thinks that Rethink came closer to solving the problem than it is given credit for, and has yet to prove in its new life under Hahn. Hahn did not respond to a request for comment by press time. \"Another eight months and maybe they might have gotten product-market fit. It was inexpensive and reliable. I really do believe we could have seen an iPhone moment,\" Beane said. In his personal blog, Brooks summed up the Rethink story this way: \"Baxter and Sawyer were the first safe robots that did not require a cage to keep humans away from them for the humans' protection. And Sawyer was the first modern industrial robot which finally got away from having a computer-like language to control it, as all robots had since the idea was first developed at the Stanford AI Lab back in the very early seventies. There is still a lot remaining to be done.\""},

In a filing with the SEC, Nvidia said the U.S. government told the company on Aug. 26, about a new license requirement for future exports to China, including Hong Kong, to reduce the risk that the products may be used by the Chinese military. Nvidia said the restriction would affect the A100 and H100 products, which are graphics processing units sold to businesses. \"The license requirement also includes any future Nvidia integrated circuit achieving both peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance equal to or greater than thresholds that are roughly equivalent to the A100, as well as any system that includes those circuits,\" the filing said. The company expects that it could lose $400 million in potential sales in China in the current quarter after previously forecasting revenue of $5.9 billion. The new rule also applies to sales to Russia, but Nvidia said it doesn't have paying customers there. In recent years, the U.S. government has applied increasing export restrictions to chips made with U.S. technology because of fears that Chinese companies could use them for military purposes or steal trade secrets. Nvidia said it was applying for a license to continue some Chinese exports but doesn't know whether the U.S. government will grant an exemption. \"We are working with our customers in China to satisfy their planned or future purchases with alternative products and may seek licenses where replacements aren't sufficient,\" an Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC. \"The only current products that the new licensing requirement applies to are A100, H100 and systems such as DGX that include them.\" An AMD representative confirmed to CNBC that it had also received new licensing requirements from the U.S. Department of Commerce which it believed applied to its MI250 circuit, which is intended for artificial intellegence. AMD said it did not believe the new requirements would cause a material impact to its business. In a statement to CNBC, a department spokesperson said \"While we are not in a position to outline specific policy changes at this time, we are taking a comprehensive approach to implement additional actions necessary related to technologies, end-uses, and end-users to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.\" WATCH: Semiconductor market signaling a surplus"},

It's also working with dairy farmers to help them reduce emissions produced on their farms. While electricity and transportation tend to get most of the attention when it comes to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, agriculture is a massive contributor. Breakthrough Energy Ventures has segmented global emissions into five categories, and agriculture is the third worst offender, responsible for 19% of total greenhouse gas emissions, behind manufacturing (31%) and electricity (27%), but ahead of transportation (16%) and buildings (7%). Neutral Foods milk is in about 2,000 grocery stores and has already received funding from a diverse roster of celebrity investors, including Mark Cuban, NBA stars LeBron James and Kevin Love, Tobias Harris, and musicians John Legend and Questlove. The company is planning to expand into butter, and eventually meat. \"It's clear that consumers are hungry for sustainable, climate-forward options and they're reflecting that in their purchasing decisions, especially when it comes to buying food and beverages,\" Carmichael Roberts, one half of the investing committee at Bill Gates' investment fund, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, told CNBC. Neutral Foods measures the carbon emissions of the entire lifecycle of its products and purchases carbon offsets for the measured emissions, Ann Radil, the Head of Carbon Reduction at Neutral Foods, told CNBC. Carbon credits are permits that businesses buy to certify greenhouse gasses have been removed from the atmosphere. While not all carbon credits are reliably policed, Neutral Foods says it uses only offsets verified by Climate Action Reserve (CAR), which it says are quite strict. CAR offsets are \"real, additional, permanent, verifiable, and enforceable,\" said Lauren Brown, senior manager of carbon reduction data and analytics for Neutral Foods. Long-term, the company's plan is to work with farms to reduce their greenhouse emissions directly. Currently, Neutral Foods has eight distinct projects underway at farms it works with and 30 projects in some phase of development, Radil told CNBC. Those projects include changing what cows eat and changing how cow manure is managed. Separating and composting manure \"alone can reduce manure-related GHG emissions like methane and nitrous oxide by 19 to 50 percent,\" Radil told CNBC. Also, Neutral Foods is working with farms to change the way they plant things on the farm to improve the amount of carbon that gets absorbed by the soil. The start-up both guides farmers to help them make changes in the operations on their farms to reduce emissions and then also provides the financing to make those changes, explains CEO Marcus Lovell Smith. Helping farmers lower the emissions on their farms requires approaching farmers with respect. \"You don't go onto a farm and tell a farmer what to do,\" said Smith, who runs his own dairy farm in New Hampshire. \"Farmers are one of the most independent minded groups of people in the country. So I learned that pretty quickly.\" One partner is Groeneveld Farms, a dairy farm with 240 cows, located in Snohomish County, Washington. The farm grows 90% of its feed, and Neutral Foods has helped it figure out how to plant two different crops -- corn and grass -- at the same time.This process, sometimes known as \"co-cropping\" or \"relay cropping\" means the farm only has to till the ground once, which decreases the amount of fossil fuels used on the farm. \"We can do this in a way that works really well for where we are located here in Washington,\" Groeneveld told CNBC. \"Neutral found this appealing and it's something that works within both of our collective budgets to try out.\" Neutral Foods started its product line with milk, which it currently sells at Amazon -owned Whole Foods, Target stores on the West Coast, Sprouts, and various other grocers. The price of Neutral Foods is \"pretty much in the middle of the pack for organic milk,\" CEO Smith said. Results so far are positive. \"We are pleased with how customers are reacting and purchasing the Neutral Foods products. Based on that, we are looking at other opportunities to expand with them into other items,\" said Sprouts spokesperson Steve Nieto. Starting in August, Neutral Foods will start selling carbon neutral pasture-raised butter, and it's planning to expand its product repertoire to include beef as well. Carman Ranch, located in the Wallowa Valley in northeast Oregon, raises cows and hogs. Owner Cory Carman, reached out to Neutral Foods to see they were working on any carbon emissions tracking programs for beef. \"We know that there are so many innovations in agriculture that can make a huge difference in greenhouse gas emissions or carbon sequestration, but discovering how those innovations play out in specific regions, or testing new ones is incredibly hard for individual ranchers,\" Carman told CNBC. Carman Ranch is what is called a \"century farm\" because the same family has worked the farm for over a hundred years. Cory herself grew up on the ranch and has worked at the ranch for the last two decades. \"Neutral has helped bring us technology, resources, and information that I would never had access to and that I am now sharing across my network.\" Carman Ranch has learned about feed supplements for cattle that lower the methane that cows belch out when they digest their food, Carman told CNBC. Currently, Carman Ranch is running trials with Neutral Foods to plant feed for their cows to graze on that contain condensed tannins. \"They are nutritious to our animals, promote soil health and can lower methane emissions,\" Carman told CNBC. Carman Ranch is also running a trial with Neutral Foods to put a seaweed supplement into the feed for 50 cattle. For this pilot program, Neutral Foods and the company making the seaweed supplement, Symbrosia, \"will bring leading researchers, partners, equipment, and procedures to measure methane emissions and weight gain, conduct a full life cycle analysis, and generate verified carbon credits,\" Carman said. It will take time for the projects Neutral Foods is doing with farms to be fully implemented and measurably reduce the emissions of their products, Radil told CNBC. But for now, Gates' investment fund is encouraged by the steps Neutral Foods is making. \"It sends a critical price signal to farmers that climate-forward practices have value. As they continue to improve upon those decarbonization techniques, there's an opportunity for scale at the farm level that can mirror the brand's growth and retail expansion,\" Roberts told CNBC. Fellow investor Marc Cuban, who put money into the company last October, agrees. \"I think consumers are becoming increasingly concerned about the impact of the products they consume on the environment,\" Cuban told CNBC. \"I think Neutral is well positioned to meet that demand.\""},

Thursday's announcement follows the largest climate funding package in U.S. history, which President Joe Biden signed into law in August. The package includes incentives to jump-start domestic supply chains for electric vehicle batteries, although Piedmont said plans for the plant were in development prior to the Inflation Reduction Act. Now that the company has selected the site in McMinn County, it will begin the process of securing the necessary permits, which can be lengthy. Still, the company is targeting construction beginning in 2023, with production starting in 2025. When fully operational, the plant will produce 30,000 metric tons of lithium per year, making it the largest lithium refining facility in the U.S, according to the company. Piedmont said it will churn out enough material to supply roughly 500,000 electric vehicles annually. Piedmont currently has no active mines in the U.S., so once the facility is up and running it will process spodumene concentrate from Piedmont's international operations in Quebec and Ghana. Eventually, the company hopes to use lithium that's mined domestically. The company has plans for a mine as well as another plant in North Carolina, although CEO Keith Phillips said it's challenging from a permitting perspective, since both the mine and the plant are on the same site. Albemarle runs the only meaningful lithium mine in the U.S., which is in Silver Peak, Nevada. Additionally, only 2.1% of lithium is refined in the U.S., according to data from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. China dominates the industry, refining more than half of global lithium supply. Should Piedmont's North Carolina mine and plant secure the required permits, however, the company forecasts its lithium output doubling, with the company supplying 1 million electric vehicles per year. Piedmont Lithium's announcement also comes as automakers are rushing toward vast electric vehicle fleets. By some forecasts, there simply won't be enough lithium to meet demand in the foreseeable future. The International Energy Agency estimates that in order to meet the goals set forth in the Paris Agreement, lithium demand will grow by over 40 times by 2040. Building new mines takes years. They're capital intensive and can face permitting challenges. There are also those opposed to new mines, who argue that the world should instead focus on existing production. Piedmont's Phillips noted that in just the last year $33 billion has been announced for electric vehicle battery manufacturing plants in the U.S., which would require 500,000 metric tons of lithium annually. \"That is more than all the lithium hydroxide produced in the world currently, so clearly the industry is facing a critical resource shortage,\" he told CNBC. \"Anyone who can produce material to supply this market \u2014 especially domestically in the United States \u2014 will be in a favored position.\" Piedmont plans to invest around $600 million developing the Tennessee facility."},

The Swedish payments firm generated revenues of 9.1 billion Swedish krona ($950 million) in the period spanning January to the end of June 2022. That was up 24% from a year ago. But the company also racked up hefty losses. Klarna's pre-tax loss soared more than threefold year-on-year to nearly 6.2 billion krona. In the first half of 2021, Klarna lost around 1.8 billion Swedish krona. The company, which allows users to spread the cost of purchases over interest-free installments, saw a jump in operating expenses and defaults. Operating expenses before credit losses came in at 10.8 billion Swedish krona, up from 6.3 billion krona year-over-year, driven by administrative costs related to its rapid international expansion in countries like the U.S. Credit losses, meanwhile, rose more than 50% to 2.9 billion Swedish krona. Klarna had previously been profitable for most of its existence \u2014 that is up until 2019, when the firm dipped into the red for the first time after a hike in investments aimed at growing the business globally. The company's ballooning losses highlight the price of its rapid expansion after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Klarna has entered 11 new markets since the start of 2020, and took a number of costly gambits to extend its foothold in the U.S. and Britain. In the U.S., Klarna has spent heavily on marketing and user acquisition in an effort to chip away at Affirm, its main rival stateside. In the U.K., meanwhile, the firm acquired PriceRunner, a price comparison site, in April. It has also engaged in a charm offensive with British politicians and regulators ahead of incoming regulations. More recently, Klarna has been forced to cut back. In May, the company slashed about 10% of its global workforce in a swift round of job cuts. The company subsequently raised raised funds at a $6.7 billion valuation \u2014 an 85% drop from its previous valuation \u2014 in an $800 million investment deal that defined the capitulation from high-growth tech firms as investors grew wary of a possible recession. The sharp discount reflected grim sentiment among investors in fintech in both the public and private markets, with publicly-listed fintech Affirm having lost about three quarters of its market value since the start of 2022. \"We've had to make some tough decisions, ensuring we have the right people, in the right place, focused on business priorities that will accelerate us back to profitability while supporting consumers and retailers through a more difficult economic period,\" said Sebastian Siemiatkowski, CEO and co-founder of Klarna. \"We needed to take immediate and pre-emptive action, which I think was misunderstood at the time, but now sadly we have seen many other companies follow suit.\" Klarna said it plans to tighten its approach to lending, particularly with new customers, to factor in the worsening cost-of-living situation. However, Siemiatkowski said, \"You won't see the impact of this on our financials in this report yet.\" \"We have a very agile balance sheet, especially in comparison to traditional banks due to the short-term nature of our products, but even for Klarna it takes a little while for the impact of decisions to flow through.\" Fintech companies are cutting expenses and delaying listing plans amid a worsening macroeconomic backdrop. Meanwhile, consumer-oriented services are losing their appeal among investors while so-called \"business-to-business\" fintechs attract the limelight. Klarna says it is now used by over 150 million people, while the company counts 450,000 merchants on its network. Klarna mainly generates income from retailers, not users, taking a small slice of each transaction processed through its platform. \"Ultimately they've proven there can be a profitable business there but have doubled down on growing in the U.S. market which is expensive,\" Simon Taylor, head of strategy at fintech startup Sardine.ai, told CNBC. \"Market share there will be meaningful for long-term revenue. But it takes time and the funding taps aren't what they used to be.\" But the company faces stiff competition, with titans in the realms of both tech and finance seeking to capitalize on growth in the buy now, pay later industry. Apple is set to launch its own BNPL product, Apple Pay Later, this fall, which will allow users to split the cost of their purchases over four equal monthly payments. Meanwhile, proposals are afoot to bring the BNPL market under regulatory supervision. In the U.K., the government has announced plans to enforce tighter affordability checks and a crackdown on misleading advertisements. Stateside, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau opened a market-monitoring probe into BNPL companies."},

Speaking to CNBC's \" Street Signs Asia\" on Wednesday, Sanjay Kapoor, who is now an independent analyst, said Indian mobile operator Reliance Jio's $25 billion plan to launch 5G network across the country indicates that India is \"very serious\" about 5G. 5G refers to the fifth generation of high-speed mobile internet which offers super-fast download speeds and more bandwidth that's capable of supporting technologies like driverless cars and virtual reality applications, including the metaverse. According to Reuters, Reliance is making a push to roll out its network within two months. It is also developing an affordable 5G smartphone with Google, according to the report. \"But when you look at what's happening \u2026 [in] China, for example, a single operator puts in more than $15 [billion], $16 billion every year, and they've been doing it for the last couple of years,\" said Kapoor. \"From an international perspective, [$25 billion] seems pretty okay. But in India, it looks really colossal.\" In July, India kicked off its 5G auction ahead of a planned 2023 rollout. Bidders include three of the country's major mobile operators in India \u2014 Reliance Jio, the market leader, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea \u2014 as well as Indian billionaire Gautam Adani's Adani Enterprises. Kapoor said the battle for the 72 gigahertz of 5G spectrum will be a \"two-horse race\" between Reliance and Bharti Airtel. \"They will be neck-to-neck [and] the strategies might differ,\" he added. Reliance Industries' Jio deposited 140 billion rupees of earnest money with the Indian government in July \u2014 it was the largest sum among the contenders. The amount of earnest money deposited is an indication of the amount of spectrum a company wishes to buy. Bharti Airtel deposited 55 billion rupees, while Vodafone Idea put in an earnest money deposit of 22 billion rupees. Reliance may have had a first-mover's advantage with its recent announcement, but Bharti Airtel's postpaid customer base could give it an edge over its rival, Kapoor said. However, what customers really value is their experience with a service provider, he pointed out. \"Therefore, each one of them will have to strive for supremacy in the market to make sure that they have a positive customer experience and are able to be competitive and world-class.\" But India's 5G infrastructure still has some way to go before that can happen, according to Kapoor. \"To give a sizable rollout in a country as large as India, it's not going to be very easy,\" he said. \"Do we have completely fiberized sites? China, for example, has a million sites already \u2026 and we [have] roughly, to each operator, about 250,000 sites.\" He added that India is going to need \"a lot more\" fiberized sites before it can give coverage to every nook and corner. Fibre infrastructure is the backbone of ultra-fast 5G networks, where a large availability of fiber-optic cables are required. \"To the time when we really can boast about giving a great customer experience, I think we are two, three years away,\" Kapoor said."},

The e-commerce platform is warning merchants who try to install Amazon's \"Buy With Prime\" button on their storefront that it violates Shopify's terms of service, and is also raising the specter of security risks, according to research firm Marketplace Pulse. Amazon introduced Buy With Prime in April, pitching it as a way for merchants to grow traffic on their own websites. The service lets merchants add the Prime logo and offer Amazon's speedy delivery options on their sites. Members of the retail giant's Prime loyalty club can check out using their Amazon account. Shopify will not protect merchants who try to use Buy With Prime against fraudulent orders, according to a screenshot of a notice Shopify sent to merchants. The notice also warns that Amazon's service could steal customer data, and charge customers incorrectly. Shopify's terms of service require merchants to use Shopify Checkout \"for any sales associated with your online store.\" Merchants can use checkout integrations that are part of Shopify's payments platform. In order to be part of the payments platform, providers have to agree to Shopify's Partnership Program Agreement and API terms. Buy With Prime competes directly with Shopify's instant checkout and payment service, Shop Pay. Shopify has sought to expand the feature beyond its own platform, striking deals with Facebook and Google last year to let customers use the system to make purchases. Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke welcomed the launch of Buy With Prime at the time of Amazon's announcement, saying the company was \"happy\" to integrate the feature into its platform. \"This fits perfectly into our world view,\" Lutke told investors on the company's first-quarter earnings call. \"And it's not nearly as zero-sum as some people make it out to be.\" Privately, Shopify may not have been as pleased about Buy With Prime. The Information reported in May that the launch sparked internal debate about whether Shopify should integrate the feature on its site. Additionally, a Shopify spokesperson told the publication that Lutke's comments only represented his opinion, adding that the company needed to gather more details before ruling on the issue. A Shopify spokesperson told CNBC in a statement: \"Shopify believes it's a good thing when a company like Amazon opens their infrastructure to more independent businesses to succeed in commerce.\" Shopify has become a popular alternative for sellers who are looking to sell products online, or diversify beyond Amazon. The Canadian company got its start providing businesses with software to help them build a presence online. Shopify in May acquired third-party fulfillment service Deliverr, putting it more directly in competition with Amazon's logistics arm. In response to Shopify's claims that Buy With Prime is insecure, an Amazon spokesperson said: \"We protect information collected via Buy with Prime, including shopper data, in accordance with Amazon's high security standards. We use this information to provide and improve Buy with Prime for merchants and shoppers.\" \"We use Amazon Pay to process payments for Buy with Prime orders. Amazon Pay is backed by the fraud protection technology used on Amazon.com,\" they added. \"Merchants have complete control over the prices customers are charged.\" Shopify said its terms of service are intended to protect merchants, and violations may trigger a warning.

But with interest rates rising and inflation stuck near a 40-year high, one part of the tech sector is still showing booming demand: cybersecurity. Earnings reports this week from CrowdStrike and SentinelOne pleasantly surprised Wall Street, and both companies, which specialize in protecting the many devices attached to corporate networks, boosted their forecasts for the year. \"Cybersecurity is not a discretionary line item,\" CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said on his company's earnings call. Investors heard similar commentary last week from Palo Alto Networks, which reported a profit for the first time in a decade. The data center security company's stock soared 12%, its best performance since its IPO in 2012. And two weeks ago, Cisco said its security business grew faster than all other segments, surpassing analysts' estimates by about $100 million. Security is now Cisco's top investment area, CEO Chuck Robbins told analysts on a conference call, and the company is staffing up as it raises prices to counter higher costs of components it needs to assemble hardware. Across the security landscape, vendors are busy providing tools to big companies concerned about vulnerabilities that have emerged due to the remote work and hybrid phenomenon and an increase in cyber attacks lodged while Russia is at war in Ukraine. \"In transformational projects, the vast majority of our customers continue on their investments here, despite the expected short-term macro impacts,\" Nikesh Arora, CEO of Palo Alto Networks, said on the call with analysts. \"Security spending is tied into our customers' desires to move to the cloud, drive more direct relationship with their customers, modernize their IT infrastructure, as well as drive efficiencies while adapting to a new way of working. Those efforts continue.\" Investors haven't made money on the security bet this year, but they've lost less than if they'd wagered on the broader tech market. Cyber-focused exchange-traded funds from First Trust Nasdaq and Global X (ticker symbol BUG) are down 22% and 19%, respectively, in 2022. The Nasdaq has dropped 25% for the year. Within software, security providers are showing the advantage they enjoy during a period of economic turmoil. Clients can't reduce their spending given the myriad of threats they face and the risks to their business if they're hit with a big ransomware attack. So they're looking elsewhere. Last week, cloud-software maker Salesforce trimmed its fiscal-year guidance and said customers had become more deliberate about purchases. The stock slid 11% over the next three trading sessions. Shares of Zoom also tumbled after the video-calling software company reduced its projections for the full year. Elsewhere in technology, ad-supported businesses like Snap and Facebook have gotten pummeled, while online commerce companies Shopify and Affirm warned of a return to pre-Covid spending patterns. Even Apple CEO Tim Cook said the iPhone marker sees\"pockets of softness\" as fears of an economic slowdown percolate. \"I don't know that anybody's using the recession word,\" said Gary Steele, CEO of Splunk, whose software helps companies analyze data to monitor performance and spot threats, in an interview this week. \"I just think that we saw macro conditions where budgets seemed to be tightening, meaning they had to make a decision about when they wanted something to happen.\" Second-quarter revenue at CrowdStrike rose 58% from a year earlier as the company signed up over 1,700 subscribing clients, more than in any previous quarter. Burt Podbere, CrowdStrike's finance chief, said the company was enjoying \"strong industry tailwinds.\" Kurtz told analysts that it's taking longer to do some deals because clients are being forced to get higher levels of required approvals before making purchases. But they're still happening. Jefferies was one of several banks to raise its price target on CrowdStrike, and analysts at the firm said the company should be reasonably sheltered in the case of a recession. SentinelOne CEO Tomer Weingarten touted his company's record-high gross margin and customer retention rate. \"Cybersecurity remains a top priority for enterprise IT spending, a must-buy for all enterprises,\" he said. Palo Alto's Arora said clients signed up for long-term deals during the quarter. That lines up with commentary from Guggenheim analysts, who wrote in a note to clients that security spending among companies they cover hasn't moderated as much as IT spending. Not all companies in the space are seeing a pop. Okta shares tumbled 33% on Thursday, after the provider of secure sign-on software cited a \"weakening economy\" and said it was struggling to integrate salespeople from Auth0, which it acquired last year for $6.5 billion. \"Integrations are always difficult and touch every part of an organization,\" CEO Todd McKinnon said on the earnings call. \"While we are making progress, we've experienced heightened attrition within the go-to-market organization, as well as some confusion in the field, both of which have impacted our business momentum.\" WATCH: Security and data are strong trends in small cloud companies, says Cohesity CEO Sanjay Poonen"},

In the smartphone field, companies ranging from Apple to Samsung have designed their own custom processors to differentiate from competitors and create better products than they might have using off-the-shelf chips. A focus on custom chips by Meta makes sense as it looks to differentiate its headsets and possibly create unique experiences for users. \"Unlike mobile phones, building virtual reality brings novel, multi-dimensional challenges in spatial computing, cost, and form factor,\" Zuckerberg said. \"These chipsets will help us keep pushing virtual reality to its limits and deliver awesome experiences.\" The length of the deal between the companies and financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

On Friday, the company launched the mid-range Honor 70 smartphone in Europe and said an unannounced foldable phone will be coming to the region and other international markets too in the future. It will be the first time Honor launches a foldable device overseas, the company said. Honor faces an uphill battle outside of China where it has less than a 1% smartphone market share. The brand was sold by Huawei to a consortium of Chinese buyers in late 2020 as a way to survive U.S. sanctions. In 2019 and 2020, Huawei was hit by a number of American sanctions that cut its access to Google software and key chips, destroying its smartphone business. Since then, Honor has launched a number of smartphones. This year, it brought its flagship Magic 4 handset to international markets. Alongside the upcoming foldable phone, Honor is placing emphasis on the more expensive premium end of the smartphone market outside of China. That will put Honor in competition with Samsung's latest foldables \u2014 the Galaxy Z Flip 4 and Galaxy Z Fold 4. \"As the global economy has deteriorated in 2022, the premium end has remained strong, benefitting Samsung and Apple so far this year,\" James Manning Smith, senior analyst at CCS Insight, told CNBC via email. \"One of Honor's greatest challenges in the year will be trying to leverage this trend, attempting to win sales from well-established premium brands, particularly in a year where stretched budgets will result in consumers looking to avoid potentially more risky purchases.\" Shipments of phones costing over $1,000 grew 94% year-on-year in the second quarter, according to Counterpoint Research. This segment is dominated by Apple and Samsung. But Honor's Chinese rivals including Xiaomi, Oppo and Realme have also managed to gain share overseas by managing to pump out mid-priced devices with high specs. That will pose another challenge to Honor. Honor's \"low-cost Chinese peers have made some serious in-roads in the European market over the last two years, a position that they will not give up without a fight,\" Smith added. \"Although Honor has been ramping up its marketing, it faces some incredibly fierce competition outside of China.\""},

It's a win for the company after it warned Wednesday that new export restrictions could hamper its operations in the country. Nvidia said in an SEC filing Wednesday that the U.S. government is restricting sales of high-performance AI chips for servers, the A100 and H100, to China and Russia. Sales of both chips are still restricted in those markets, though it can still develop the H100 in China. Nvidia expects a $400 million hit to revenue in the current quarter from new export restrictions. The company's stock fell nearly 9% in trading Thursday. \"The U.S. government has authorized exports, reexports, and in-country transfers needed to continue NVIDIA Corporation's, or the Company's, development of H100 integrated circuits,\" Nvidia said in a filing Thursday. The Biden administration is working to limit U.S. exports of certain semiconductors and equipment because of fears that Chinese companies could use them for military purposes. Graphics processors like the kind that Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices make are well suited for artificial intelligence applications that could include weapons development, facial recognition and other military uses. The H100 is Nvidia's upcoming enterprise AI chip that was previously expected to ship by the end of the year. Part of its development takes place in China. The A100 is an older model that has been shipping for three years. They are both graphics processors that can be used for supercomputing and artificial intelligence. Nvidia's data center business, which includes sales of the A100 and H100, is one of the fastest-growing parts of the company, reporting $3.8 billion in sales in the June quarter, a 61% annual increase. However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang warned analysts in August that Chinese cloud companies were slowing down building out their data centers and that China was a \"very large market\" for the company. Nvidia said Thursday that it can continue to ship AI chips from its Hong Kong facility through September 2023. \"The Chinese hyperscalers and the Chinese Internet companies really, really slowed down infrastructure investment this year, particularly starting in -- they've been rather slow in building out and really accelerate -- well, really slowed down in Q2,\" Huang said. Some analysts believe that Nvidia can ameliorate the impact of the new export restrictions by working with the government, although it's unclear whether the Chinese government might retaliate with its own bans. \"While there are potential near and intermediate term risks from the export ban, Nvidia is working closely with the [U.S. government] to navigate through the situation and we believe the USG is fully aware of the critical/strategic importance of Nvidia's accelerated compute platform to the global tech industry,\" JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur wrote in a note Thursday. The Department of Commerce said the new export restrictions are related to national security, but it didn't answer follow-up questions about whether it clarified or changed the policy for Nvidia. \"While we are not in a position to outline specific policy changes at this time, we are taking a comprehensive approach to implement additional actions necessary related to technologies, end-uses, and end-users to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests,\" a Department of Commerce representative said Wednesday. AMD also said Wednesday that it received new license requirements from the Department of Commerce, but did not expect them to materially affect its business because of lower China exposure.

{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/01/why-arms-lawsuit-against-qualcomm-is-a-big-deal.html", "title": "Why Arm's lawsuit against Qualcomm is a big deal", "paragraphs": " Arm is suing Qualcomm, putting two of the most valuable semiconductor firms into direct conflict, and raising questions about the future of the partnership between the two firms. The lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, comes at a critical time for Arm as its owner Softbank hopes to soon list the firm on public markets after a deal to sell it to Nvidia fell through because of regulatory scrutiny. But the suit also threatens Qualcomm's expansion plans, as it was hoping to use Nuvia processor designs at the heart of the dispute to compete more directly with Apple's chips for iPhones and Macs, and possibly use them to crack the server chip market, a lucrative space dominated by Intel and AMD. Nuvia was founded by ex-Apple chip designers and Qualcomm spent $1.4 billion to acquire it in 2021. Qualcomm's current Snapdragon chips for smartphones are also based on Arm technology. Arm is seeking damages and to force Qualcomm to destroy information and hardware from the Nuvia acquisition including chips, dies, packaging and promotional materials. The dispute centers around the rights to develop a chip using Arm's instruction set architecture (ISA), a core piece of intellectual property with origins dating back to 1985 that outlines how a chip performs basic functions like accessing memory or basic arithmetic. Arm-based chips have been ascendant in recent years because they're more power-efficient than the x86-based chips made by Intel and AMD. Over 29 billion chips based on Arm technology were shipped in 2021, including the chips at the heart of Apple's iPhones, Macs and iPads. Some companies, like Apple, license the ISA from Arm, then design their own physical processor circuits to implement the ISA instructions. Other companies, like Qualcomm historically, also buy the rights to full core designs from Arm, marketed as Cortex. Arm reported $2.7 billion in sales from licensing and royalties in 2021. The suit highlights the tension between Arm's business licensing the underlying intellectual property to make processors that could compete with the company's own designs. Arm said last year that it considered Qualcomm to be a competitor and that architectural licenses pose a threat to its implementation business. Lawsuits over intellectual property and contracts in the semiconductor industry are common. But the Arm-Qualcomm lawsuit is a significant conflict over the ability to design the kind of chip at the heart of nearly every smartphone in the world. It could have significant ramifications for chip startups and could open up a path to adoption for open-source alternatives to Arm. Qualcomm general counsel Ann Chaplin said in a statement that the dispute was a departure from a \"longstanding, successful relationship.\" \"Arm has no right, contractual or otherwise, to attempt to interfere with Qualcomm's or NUVIA's innovations,\" Chaplin said. \"Arm's complaint ignores the fact that Qualcomm has broad, well-established license rights covering its custom-designed CPUs, and we are confident those rights will be affirmed.\" Meanwhile, Arm said in a statement that the company was \"left with no choice other than to bring this claim against Qualcomm and Nuvia to protect our IP, our business, and to ensure customers are able to access valid Arm-based products.\" Qualcomm bought Nuvia because it wanted its chips to have better performance than what it could do with an off-the-shelf Arm processor design, especially to compete with Apple's high-efficiency custom Arm cores. Nuvia, a startup founded by former Apple and Google engineers, was developing a server chip with custom cores under an architecture license. It also had access to Arm's core designs. After the acquisition, Qualcomm placed Nuvia at the heart of its smartphone and PC strategy, using the startup's cores to make its laptop processors more competitive with Apple's M-series chips in products launching as soon as 2023. Qualcomm was also pitching Nuvia-based cloud processors to cloud providers such as Amazon, according to Bloomberg News. Arm says in its lawsuit that Nuvia's architectural license didn't transfer to Qualcomm when it bought it. Qualcomm has an architectural license, Arm says, but needed Arm's consent to purchase and use Nuvia's custom core designs. Arm terminated its Nuvia licenses in March, it said. If that holds in court, Qualcomm's entire chip strategy could be in flux. There may be an alternative route, however. Karl Freund, founder and analyst at Cambrian AI Research, speculated that Qualcomm could try to use RISC-V, an open source alternative to Arm's instruction set. Arm told regulators in December that \"RISC-V's momentum is accelerating\" and that established vendors are increasingly using it instead of Arm's instruction set. A few startups are currently building CPU cores based on RISC-V, but it has yet to be used in high-volume smartphones, which all currently use Arm. Arm's efforts to enforce its intellectual property with long-term partners, however, will likely prompt companies building custom Arm cores to take another look at open-source alternatives."},

Chipmaker Nvidia's shares have plunged around 13% this week after the company disclosed new U.S. restrictions on its exports to China, affecting about $400 million in potential sales in the current quarter. In China, the Nvidia Drive Orin chip has become a core part of electric automakers' assisted driving tech. These semi-autonomous driving systems are an important selling point for the companies in what has become a fiercely competitive market in China. Some automakers are also using Nvidia's Xavier chip. Automotive is a relatively small but fast-growing part of Nvidia's business. However, the new U.S. restrictions target Nvidia's A100 and H100 products \u2014 and these chips' sales are part of the company's far larger data center business. The products are graphics processors that can be used for artificial intelligence. \"There shouldn't be any restrictions on Xavier and Orin, and Xpeng, Nio and others would continue to ship with those chips,\" said Bevin Jacob, partner at Shanghai-based investment and consulting firm Automobility. Jacob, however, did warn that there could be \"close scrutiny\" in the future on U.S. firms shipping chips relating to artificial intelligence and autonomous driving to China. Xpeng declined to comment. Nio, Li Auto, Huawei and Jidu \u2014 a new electric vehicle brand backed by Baidu and Geely \u2014 did not respond to requests for comment. The new U.S. rules are designed to reduce the risk of supporting the Chinese military, according to the U.S. government, Nvidia said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. But it's unclear what prompted this specific policy move or what could drive future ones. In another positive sign for the chipmaker, the U.S. will allow Nvidia to continue developing its H100 artificial intelligence chip in China, the company said Thursday. \"The U.S. government has authorized exports, reexports, and in-country transfers needed to continue NVIDIA Corporation's, or the Company's, development of H100 integrated circuits,\" Nvidia said in a filing Thursday. The company said second-quarter revenue for its automotive business was $220 million, up 45% from a year earlier. \"Our automotive revenue is inflecting, and we expect it to be our next billion-dollar business,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in an earnings call in late August, according to a StreetAccount transcript. WeRide, an autonomous driving technology start-up, said in a statement that \"there is no immediate impact from the ban.\" \"We believe both the supply and demand side in the industry will work closely together to handle the constantly changing business environment to safeguard the continuous development of technology,\" the company said in a statement to CNBC. Pony.ai, another autonomous driving start-up, said it is not affected, as did automaker Geely. \u2014 CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report."},

Two years later, they shared their first kiss outside an Amazon seller summit in New Orleans. And in 2020, Gao left her home in Los Angeles to move in with Levine in Chicago, bringing their e-commerce businesses under one roof. So it only made sense that when it came time to tie the knot, they turned to e-commerce for their inspiration. On Aug. 21, the couple tied the knot in Chicago, and the wedding reception was filled with Amazon paraphernalia. At the reception, guests were seated at tables designated by a ten-digit code used to look up products on Amazon's website (known as an ASIN in seller parlance). Wedding favors were tiny Amazon packages, complete with barcodes and filled with treats, placed in miniature shopping carts. Attendees posed for photos in front of a backdrop declaring \"Jeddie (a combination of the couples' first names) Prime Day,\" an homage to Amazon's annual summer shopping bonanza. Although the references were a little bit esoteric, at least the couple was confident that some of their guests would understand them. Levine gave a toast during the reception. \"I said, 'Last but certainly not least, e-commerce brought us together. If we have met you as a result of e-commerce, directly or indirectly, stand up,\" he told CNBC in an interview. \"Literally half of our guests stood up.\" Not everyone got it, though. \"The bartender was like, 'Can you tell me what the deal is with all the Amazon-inspired stuff?,\" said Robyn Johnson, CEO of digital marketing agency Marketplace Blueprint, and a friend of the couple who attended the wedding. Both Levine and Gao have worked in e-commerce for more than a decade. Levine is president and co-founder of Hub Dub, which helps brands manage their businesses online and provides logistics services. Gao runs an Amazon business selling home d\u00e9cor products. Levine and Gao are part of an active community of sellers, consultants and service providers that's sprung up around Amazon's third-party marketplace. Launched in 2000, the marketplace has become a centerpiece of its dominant e-commerce business, as it now accounts for more than half of online retail sales. As of 2021, there were more than six million third-party sellers worldwide on the Amazon marketplace, according to research firm Marketplace Pulse. Gao met Levine at an Atlanta conference through a consultant who was helping her with her Amazon business, and who also happened to be Levine's friend. They didn't hit it off right away. But over the following months, Gao and Levine continued to run into each other on the e-commerce conference circuit and developed a friendship. Their friendship turned romantic in June 2018 at Amazon's Boost conference for third-party sellers in New Orleans. The conference coincided with Gao's 29th birthday, so she invited Levine and some of their friends out for a night of barhopping in New Orleans' historic French Quarter. That night, they kissed for the first time. On the last day of the conference, they went for a long walk through the streets of New Orleans, a memory they both half-jokingly describe as their \"five-hour marriage contract.\" \"We were contracting where we're going to live, the family we're going to bring, the religion we're going to have in the household, education,\" Gao said. \"We were lining it up.\" \"Based on five hours of back and forth, we found we were at least a decent match,\" Levine added. A few days later, Levine flew from Chicago to Los Angeles for their first date. He returned to Chicago the following day in time for a 10-day trip in Europe. They continued dating long-distance for the next two years, until June 2020. It was the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, and they could no longer safely hop on a plane for their bi-weekly visits. They decided it was the right time to move in together, and Levine proposed to Gao at Niagara Falls that September. Levine was the one who came up with the idea for an Amazon-inspired wedding. \"We went through all these ideas, and they were so boring,\" Levine said. \"I wanted something that showcased our background and gave homage to where we came from.\" Levine, who is Jewish, chose Jeff Cohen, an Amazon employee who previously worked for Seller Labs, which held the conference where they met, to serve as a witness when they signed their wedding contract, known as the ketubah. And guests who helped connect the couple at Amazon events had special \"matchmaker\" signs on the back of their chairs. They jokingly toyed with the idea of turning their wedding into a full-blown Amazon conference, with a software company offering, in jest, to sponsor the event. \"I said, 'No, I am not getting you a booth at our wedding,\" Levine said."},

Employees are turning to gadgets to outsmart monitoring software. One such tool is a mouse mover, or mouse jiggler, that's supposed to keep your screen on. I decided to give one a try to see if it works. I learned about mouse jigglers on TikTok. A mouse mover is a device that claims to be undetectable by your computer. As the name indicates, the device simulates mouse movement, preventing your computer from going into sleep mode. So-called \"tattleware,\" or surveillance software, is being installed on company-issued devices to track employee screen time, keyboard usage, and clicks. The mouse jiggler may not help with keyboard usage or clicks, but it should address screen time monitoring by keeping your computer's display on. Here's how a mouse jiggler works. I ordered a $30 Vaydeer Mouse Jiggler off Amazon and tested it out for a day. It took less than a minute to set up. You simply plug the power cord into the USB port on your computer, or attach it to the power brick and plug it into the wall. Use the wall for power if you're paranoid. You probably don't want to plug any type of device that helps you avoid work directly into a work-owned computer, especially since USB ports open up a whole host of security concerns, too. There's an orange power button on the left side that you can press to turn it on and off. A turntable moves when it's on. That's where you place the mouse's sensor. Once your mouse is in the right position, you'll begin to see the cursor on your screen move very slowly, keeping your monitor from going to sleep. That's pretty much all there is to it. Once your mouse is on the jiggler you can get up, make lunch, do whatever you need, and your computer won't go to sleep. It won't make you more productive, of course, but it may trick some surveillance software into thinking you're still working, at least if that software is checking to see if your computer is active. We shouldn't need these gadgets in the first place, though. I was surprised to learn employer surveillance is more common than I thought. A recent examination by The New York Times found that 80% of the 10 largest private U.S. employers track the productivity metrics of individual workers. And secretly monitoring employees makes them more likely to break the very rules these systems are trying to deter, according to a recent study by Harvard Business Review. Transparency is key to keeping worker morale up. Explaining the scope and purpose of monitoring can boost employees' acceptance of the practice by about 70%, according to a recent study by Gartner, a management consultant company."},

In April, more than 2,600 workers at Amazon's warehouse in Staten Island, known as JFK8, voted to join the Amazon Labor Union, becoming the first group to vote in favor of unionizing at one of the e-commerce giant's U.S. facilities. Amazon in May sought to overturn the results of the election. It submitted a filing to the NLRB accusing the federal agency's Brooklyn office of violating labor law by appearing to support the union drive. Amazon, which included 25 objections in its filing, also alleged that labor organizers intimidated workers to vote in their favor. Amazon's objections kicked off 24 days of hearings held via Zoom where lawyers for the company, NLRB's Region 29 office, and the ALU dissected conduct during the election. JFK8 workers and union organizers, including Chris Smalls, co-founder and interim president of the ALU, were among the more than a dozen witnesses called to testify. Lisa Dunn, the NLRB attorney presiding over the hearing, concluded in a filing Thursday that Amazon \"had not met its burden\" of establishing the agency, the union or any other parties \"engaged in objectionable conduct affecting the results of the election,\" NLRB spokesperson Kayla Blado said. Dunn also recommended ALU be certified as bargaining representative, Blado said. Amazon has until Sept. 16 to file objections to Dunn's recommendations, which will then be heard by a regional director of the NLRB. The regional director will determine whether to order a new union election, or certify the results of the April election, at which point Amazon will be required to start contract negotiations with the ALU. The union said in a statement that it's pleased with the hearing officer's recommendations. \"It is our hope that the Regional Director for Region 28 can expedite our certification and that the NLRB enforces Amazon's legal obligation to negotiate with the workers of the ALU,\" the union said in a release posted to Twitter. Representatives from Amazon and the NLRB didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The ALU, a grassroots organization of current and former Amazon employees, has sought to expand its reach beyond JFK8. The union in May failed to replicate its successful union campaign at another Staten Island warehouse, but it has gained traction elsewhere. Workers at an Amazon warehouse near Albany are seeking to be represented by the ALU. The NLRB has yet to set a date for that election. A Kentucky Amazon warehouse has also expressed interest in organizing under ALU. WATCH: How two friends formed Amazon's first U.S. union and what's next"},

Some 220 solar panels and other equipment at the facility, known as FAT1, were damaged by the three-alarm fire, which was caused by \"an undetermined electrical event within the solar system mounted on top of the roof,\" Leland Wilding, Fresno's fire investigator, wrote in an incident report. A little over a year later, about 60 firefighters were called to an even larger Amazon facility in Perryville, Maryland, to put out a two-alarm blaze, local news outlets reported. In the intervening months, at least four other Amazon fulfillment centers caught fire or experienced electrical explosions due to failures with their solar energy-generating systems, according to internal company documents viewed by CNBC. The documents, which have never been made public, indicate that between April 2020 and June 2021, Amazon experienced \"critical fire or arc flash events\" in at least six of its 47 North American sites with solar installations, affecting 12.7% of such facilities. Arc flashes are a kind of electrical explosion. \"The rate of dangerous incidents is unacceptable, and above industry averages,\" an Amazon employee wrote in one of the internal reports. The solar snafus underscore the challenge Amazon and many other large corporations face in their quest to shrink their environmental footprint and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Amazon has been among the most aggressive. In 2019, founder Jeff Bezos launched the Climate Pledge, promising the largest online retailer would zero out emissions by 2040, embrace renewable energy and move away from gas-guzzling delivery vans, including through a billion-dollar-plus investment in electric vehicle company Rivian. Corporate America is under pressure from regulators and a growing subset of investors to set and report on environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals. Many will be able to reap financial rewards for renewable energy efforts after Congress in August passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes climate provisions projected to reduce the country's carbon emissions by roughly 40% by 2030. Commercial solar in the U.S. is expected to see 8% annual growth over the next five years, thanks in part to the legislation, according to Wood Mackenzie solar analyst Michelle Davis. Warehouses can take outsized advantage of solar, she said, because they have large roofs and the systems can power all the HVAC, refrigeration and other energy-heavy systems located inside. But costly and dangerous issues can arise. By June of last year, all of Amazon's U.S. operations with solar had to be taken offline temporarily, internal documents show. The company had to ensure its systems were designed, installed and maintained properly before \"re-energizing\" any of them. Amazon spokesperson Erika Howard told CNBC in a statement that the incidents involved systems run by partners, and that the company responded by voluntarily turning off its solar-powered roofs. \"Out of an abundance of caution, following a small number of isolated incidents with onsite solar systems owned and operated by third parties, Amazon proactively powered off our onsite solar installations in North America, and took immediate steps to re-inspect each installation by a leading solar technical expert firm,\" the statement said. Those details didn't show up in Amazon's 100-page sustainability report for 2021, which was published at the beginning of August. In that report, available to the public via Amazon's sustainability website, the company said rooftop solar was powering 115 of its fulfillment centers across the globe by the end of 2021, up from more than 90 in the middle of the year. The majority of those are outside the U.S. \"Many of our fulfillment facilities throughout the U.S., Europe, and India are powered by on-site solar, where a rooftop installation can power up to 80% of the facility's energy use,\" the report said. By April of this year, Amazon had onsite solar at 176 facilities, according to its website. The solar program was launched in 2017. \"As inspections are completed, our onsite solar systems are being powered back on,\" Howard said. \"Amazon also built a team of dedicated solar experts overseeing the construction, operations, and maintenance of our systems in-house to ensure the safety of our systems.\" Excluded from the public sustainability report is any mention of the expenses Amazon incurs when there's a failure. An Amazon employee estimated, in the documents circulated internally, that each incident cost the company an average of $2.7 million. Costs included third-party audits of rooftop solar systems, checks on how much electricity they were generating and repairs for any broken or faulty parts of the systems that inspectors identified. The Amazon employee also said the company would lose $940,000 per month, or $20,000 for each of the 47 decommissioned North American sites, as long as the solar remained offline. There could be additional costs for Amazon depending on contracts with clean energy partners for renewable energy credits, the documents show. To date, Amazon has contracted with third-party vendors to design, then install solar photovoltaic systems on rooftops and big backup batteries on site. Other major retailers, including Walmart and Target, have also installed solar rooftops and adopted programs to trim their energy bills and reach sustainability goals. In addition to its warehouses, Amazon has some solar roof systems at its Whole Foods stores. Amazon and its auditor, Clean Energy Associates (CEA), put off inspection of the solar rooftop systems at Whole Foods locations until 2022, the documents said. As of late 2021, four years after acquiring Whole Foods, Amazon was still working to attain technical information about the renewable energy assets at the stores. To maintain tighter quality control of its solar energy systems, some Amazon employees recommended bringing more operations in-house. The fire in Perryville, Maryland, which was the sixth failure in a little over a year, spurred the company to take systematic action. On June 17, 2021, roughly a week after the fire at the warehouse known as MDT2, Amazon's sustainability division directed the owners and developers of solar rooftop systems on its U.S. warehouses to decommission them. The solar rooftops would no longer be generating electricity from the sun or producing renewable energy credits. Amazon then hired Denver-based CEA to conduct a third-party audit of its rooftop solar systems in the U.S., Asia-Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Late last year, while CEA was still conducting its inspections, it informed Amazon of one critical and 259 major findings across Amazon's rooftop solar portfolio. Problems included mismatched module-to-module connectors, improper installation of connectors, poor wire management and evidence of water intrusion in the inverters, internal documents said. Issues with inverters, which convert solar energy into usable electricity, were identified as the likely cause of a fire in at least one Amazon warehouse. Wilding, the Fresno fire inspector, concluded the blaze at FAT1 \"originated on or near two inverters,\" according to an investigation report obtained by CNBC through a request for public records. Amazon blamed third-party partners and vendors for the most significant problems uncovered by CEA and other teams working on facilities and sustainability initiatives. \"Over the past five years, solar malfunctions have been caused by improper installation techniques, improper commissioning of a new system, inadequate system maintenance and equipment malfunction,\" the documents said. Amazon teams working on facilities and sustainability initiatives devised a two-part plan to help prevent future breakdowns in the rooftop solar program. In late 2021, the divisions requested $3.6 million in funding to reinspect sites where major findings were identified in order to ensure the systems were safe to be brought back online, according to internal correspondence. Internal teams also began to urge Amazon leadership to rely more on salaried employees and less on outside vendors. Over time, the company hired more solar experts focused on procurement, design, construction and maintenance globally. In some cases, management was notably slow in responding. For example, the groups inside the company agitating for change went to leadership for approval on the hiring, re-inspection and re-energizing plans. But the efforts were held up for months by top Amazon executives, including Kara Hurst, vice president of worldwide sustainability, and Alicia Boler-Davis, senior vice president of global customer fulfillment, who left the company in June 2022, according to internal correspondence viewed by CNBC. Amazon disputed the claim in the documents that leadership was slow to address employee requests. Job openings suggest Amazon is still seeking to hire people internally for solar operations. The company was recently looking for someone to manage sustainability projects across its North American facilities, which include rooftop solar. There's a current listing for a technical program partner on the solar team says that a key aspect of the position is collaborating with \"internal partners\" in worldwide design, solar construction and sustainability, among other divisions. As it tries to staff up, Amazon has acknowledged that going green comes with hurdles, particularly for a company \"of the size and broad scope of Amazon.\" \"But at Amazon, we don't shy away from big challenges,\" Hurst wrote, in the letter kicking off the 2021 sustainability report. \"We don't have all the answers today, but we believe in the need to act now.\" WATCH: How two friends formed Amazon's first U.S. union and what's next"},

The website called Temu, which went online Thursday, lists items across a number of categories including clothing, jewelry, pet supplies and home and garden, and could mark a new challenge to U.S. e-commerce leader Amazon. Pinduoduo did not respond to a request for comment when contacted by CNBC. Temu marks Pinduoduo's biggest push overseas yet as the domestic Chinese economy faces a number of challenges from a resurgence of Covid-19 to an energy crunch. That has hurt economic growth in China and dampened consumer sentiment. China's biggest technology companies from Tencent to Pinduoduo's e-commerce rivals Alibaba and JD.com continue to pursue international markets. Pinduoduo, a much younger company than Alibaba and JD.com, having only been founded in 2015, is behind its rivals when it comes to the overseas push. Alibaba took a controlling stake in Singapore-based Southeast Asian e-commerce site Lazada in 2016 and has since invested money in the business to expand its presence in the region. Alibaba also has a separate website called AliExpress that services markets like Europe and the U.S. JD.com meanwhile operates Joybuy.com for international customers. Pinduoduo's Temu is a cross-border e-commerce website with most products likely to come from overseas, especially China. Temu said shipping to the U.S. could take 7-15 business days. \"It's important to keep in mind that you may see longer delivery times than you're used to from other e-commerce websites. This is due to the fact that items that may be coming from another country or need to be bundled or packaged with other similar-sized items,\" the website says on the shipping information page. Shipping is free for orders over $49. Pinduoduo could face some challenges in cracking the U.S. market. First it will need to build brand reputation versus the likes of Amazon. And it could also suffer from its relatively long shipping times versus the same-day or next-day deliveries Amazon offers via its Prime subscription services. Temu's \"main challenges will be cultivating trust and awareness among customers,\" Jacob Cooke, CEO of WPIC, an e-commerce tech and marketing firm that helps foreign brands sell in China, told CNBC. There are currently also some categories that have very few products. For example, the men's wristwatch category had just two products listed. However, Temu could compete on price. On Thursday, Temu had a 20% discount offer sitewide. And products appear to be quite cheap. For example, the women's dresses listed were mostly under $20. Temu could also have an advantage due to \"existing relationships with low-cost manufacturers in China that maybe haven't expanded to the U.S. yet,\" Cooke said. Pinduoduo has grown quickly in its seven-year history to become one of China's biggest e-commerce firms. The company has tended to focus on lower-income consumers by offering heavily discounted products. And it has been focusing on bringing agricultural products onto its platform to differentiate from rivals. The company is worth around $87 billion."},

Although monkeypox cases are still increasing nationally, the speed of the outbreak appears to be slowing, Walensky said. The U.S. has reported nearly 17,000 monkeypox cases since May, more than any other country in the world, according to CDC data. In New York City, which has reported more infections than any other jurisdiction, new monkeypox cases have dropped from more than 70 per day on average to nine as of Thursday, according to data from the city health department. Dr. Aswhin Vasan, the city health commissioner, said earlier this week the outbreak has slowed due to increased vaccination and community outreach efforts. New York City has reported a total of 2,888 monkeypox cases. In Chicago, another major epicenter of the outbreak, new cases have dropped from 141 during the week ended July 30 to 74 for the week ended Aug. 20, according to that city's health department. Chicago has reported a total of 807 cases. \"We're not seeing the potentially exponential growth that we were seeing early on so that is reassuring,\" said Dr. Allison Arwady, Chicago's public health commissioner, during a Facebook live event earlier this week. \"Too early to say things look really good, but definitely some signs of slowing of cases.\" The U.S. is nearing the point where the entire community of gay and bisexual men who currently face the greatest health risk from monkeypox rwill have access to two doses of the monkeypox vaccine, according to Dawn O'Connell, head of the office responsible for the national stockpile at the Health and Human Services Department. The CDC previously estimated that up to 1.7 million gay and bisexual men who are HIV-positive or are eligible for medicine to reduce their chance of contracting HIV face the greatest health risk from monkeypox. The U.S. has distributed 1.5 million doses of the monkeypox vaccine so far and more than 3 million doses should be available by when the latest distribution round is complete, according to O'Connell. To date, the outbreak is disproportionately affecting Black and Hispanic men. About 30% of monkeypox patients are white, 32% are Hispanic and 33% are Black, according to CDC data. Whites make up about 59% of the U.S. population while Hispanics and Blacks account for 19% and 13%, respectively. The monkeypox vaccine, called Jynneos in the U.S., is administered in two doses 28 days apart. The patients will not have full protection from the vaccine until two weeks after the second dose is administered, according to the CDC. Data from 19 jurisdictions show that nearly 97% of the shots administered so far were first doses, according to Walensky. About 94% of monkeypox cases are associated with sexual contact and nearly all of the people who have contracted the virus are men who have sex with men, according to Demetre Daskalakis, the deputy head of the White House monkeypox response team. A CDC survey of 824 gay and bisexual men found that 48% respondents have reduced their number of sexual partners and 50% have reduced one-time sexual encounters during the current outbreak. A separate CDC study found that a 40% decrease in one-time sexual encounters would reduce the final percentage of gay and bisexual men infected with monkeypox by up to 31%. \"We're actually seeing vaccine get out, behaviors change, harm-reduction messages being heard and implemented,\" Walensky said. \"And all of that working together to bend the curve.\" Correction: 33% of confirmed monkeypox cases are among Black Americans. A previous version of this story misstated the figure."},

Over the past two years, fall and winter have brought devastating Covid surges that took hundreds of thousands of lives and pushed hospitals to the breaking point. But U.S. health officials say the nation is in a much different place today due to the arsenal of tools doctors now have to fight the virus. \"We are in a much, much better place. We are in a better place because people have gotten vaccinated and boosted. We've got treatments that are widely available,\" Dr. Ashish Jha, White House Covid response coordinator, said in an August interview with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a report published in early August, said high levels of immunity in the U.S. population from vaccination and infection have substantially reduced the threat of hospitalization and death from Covid. The CDC ended its quarantine recommendations for people exposed to the virus last month. Public health officials are calling on people to stay up to date on their vaccines, but are largely leaving it up to individuals to decide what other precautions they should take based on their health history, risk tolerance and how much Covid is spreading in their communities. The CDC is taking a more targeted approach that focuses on making sure those at the highest risk of severe illness have access to vaccines, antiviral treatments and other therapeutics to protect their health. Many people haven't had a vaccine dose in months, which means their immune protection against the virus is waning off with some studies showing three shots of the original vaccines were just 19% effective at preventing Covid infection after five months. At the same time, more transmissible omicron subvariants are spreading. It's creating a perfect storm ahead of the cold weather months and holidays that force people indoors in close proximity to each other and a highly contagious airborne pathogen. Even with all the tools the U.S. has available, Covid infections, hospitalizations and deaths have plateaued at stubbornly high levels over the summer. The U.S. is gearing up for a booster campaign after Labor Day with reformulated vaccines that target both the original strain of the virus that emerged in Wuhan, China, in 2019 and omicron BA.5, the dominant variant in circulation. Public health officials believe the reformulated boosters will provide more durable protection against infection and help avert a major surge that taxes hospitals. \"It's going to be really, really important for people to get this updated, new, very specific Covid vaccine because I think it's going to help a lot in preventing infections, and I think it is going to help a lot in keeping people out of the hospital,\" Jha said. The U.S. has so far secured 171 million doses of Pfizer's and Moderna's new boosters shots that target omicron. The reformulated boosters could reduce infections by 2.4 million, hospitalizations by 137,000 and deaths by 9,700 from August through May of 2023 if a new variant doesn't emerge, according to a projection by a team of scientists who forecast the trajectory of the pandemic, called the Covid-19 Scenario Modeling Hub. But the projection is based on optimistic assumptions about booster coverage and efficacy, according to the scientists. The model assumes that the shots will prove 80% effective at preventing illness, the vaccination campaign will ramp up quickly and the public will broadly embrace the new boosters. But many people in the U.S. still haven't gotten their first booster with the old vaccine yet, and it's not clear that these individuals will be more willing to take the new shots. About 76% of people ages 12 and older have received their first two vaccine doses, according to CDC data. Out of those people, about half have gotten their third shot. It's also not clear how effective the new omicron boosters will be in the real world yet. The Food and Drug Administration authorized the shots on Wednesday without results from human trials on the BA.5 shots. But Dr. Peter Marks, head of the FDA office responsible for reviewing vaccines, said the available data suggests the shots will provide substantially better protection. Public health officials are working under the assumption that the U.S. will face some version of omicron in the fall, which is why the new vaccines target BA.5. But there is always the risk that a new variant outside the omicron lineage will emerge that can evade the new shots. If Covid mutates in a way that gives life to a new, dominant variant and boosters are slow to get out to the public, the U.S. could suffer 1.3 million hospitalizations and 181,000 deaths over the next nine months, according to the scientists' most pessimistic scenario. But Michael Osterholm, director of Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said the reality is that nobody really knows what will happen in the fall. \"We don't know,\" he said. Ali Mokdad, an epidemiologist at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, said his group is predicting a rise in Covid cases, deaths and hospitalizations this fall. \"But the rise in mortality and hospitalization will not be similar to what we have seen before, simply because most people have some kind of immunity against illness,\" Mokdad said. About 95% of people ages 16 and older in the U.S., in fact, have Covid antibodies of some sort \u2014 either from vaccination or prior infection, according to a CDC survey of blood donor data. This means more people in the U.S. have at least some protection against severe disease and death from Covid than at any other point in the pandemic. Previous infection, vaccination alone and vaccination plus infection didn't necessarily keep people from getting sick, but they all showed more than 70% effectiveness against developing a really severe case or dying from omicron BA.2 , according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Weill Cornell Medicine in Qatar. The study examined the medical records of 100,000 individuals in Qatar from December 2021 through February 2022. But the Qatar study may not translate well to the U.S. population, which has a large elderly population and many people with preexisting medical conditions, like obesity or diabetes. Qatar on the other hand has a very young population \u2014 only 9% of its residents are age 50 or older compared with more than a third of all Americans. Omicron has also continued to evolve into more transmissible and immune-evasive subvariants. The BA.5 subvariant became dominant this summer, pushing out BA.2. Though BA.5 has not been associated with more severe disease, it is more effective at evading immunity and infecting people who are vaccinated or who have recovered from Covid. \"BA.5 is the most contagious, certainly the most immune evasive variant we've seen,\" Jha told NBC News in July. \"That means if you were infected earlier this you're still at very high risk of reinfection. It means if you've not been vaccinated recently you have a very high risk of having a breakthrough.\" While the CDC previously thought that infection provided about 90 days of protection, Jha told reporters in July that breakthrough infections have become more common and are happening earlier with BA.5. He said it's unclear how long immunity lasts after recovering from a BA.5 infection. Osterholm said the pandemic has entered another unprecedented period. Previously, infections have surged to high peaks and then steeply declined before the next wave. But for the past three months, infections, hospitalizations and deaths have plateaued at a high level with no sign of another variant displacing BA.5, he said. \"We're seeing now more and more people are on their second and third episodes of this,\" Osterholm said. \"What is the interaction between increasing vaccination, natural infection and immunity related to infection? We just don't know,\" he said. It's unclear whether the current pattern of transmission will continue or if the U.S. will face another wave, Osterholm said. Right now, the U.S. is averaging more than 88,000 new infections daily, which is likely a vast undercount because people testing positive at home isn't picked up by the official data. More than 32,000 people total are hospitalized across the U.S. with Covid right now, and an average of nearly 400 people are still dying every day from the virus, according to data from the CDC and the Health and Human Services Department. That's a significant improvement from the peak of the outbreak in the winter of 2021 when more than 3,000 people died a day on average. Though milder today than those early days of the pandemic, Covid is still killing at four or five times the fatality rate of the flu, Jha told the Chamber. \"If everybody was up to date on their vaccines and people got treated with Paxlovid as they're supposed to deaths would go to close to zero across America,\" Jha said. Hospitalizations are down 75% and deaths are down 85% from the peak of last winter's omicron surge. But if deaths remain at their current level through next year, more than 140,000 people would succumb to the virus, which would still make Covid one of the 10 leading causes of death in the U.S. \"Will we continue to see this kind of activity maintained for some time? People will say it can't go on endlessly because people will be infected and develop immunity. But what happens with waning immunity?\" Osterholm said. Many elderly people and individuals with weak immune systems remain vulnerable to the virus. The rate of hospitalization and death from Covid has increased among those ages 65 and older since April despite high levels of vaccination in this age group, according to CDC data. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Brown University School of Public Health, said she is worried about the elderly and those with weak immune systems who are not up to date on their vaccines heading into the fall. Nuzzo said the public health response this fall should be laser focused on making sure these people are protected. \"I have some worry that unless we put that at the top of our list, our efforts are just going to be diluted, spread out over a number of different areas,\" Nuzzo said. \"If we fail to make sure the highest-risk people are fully protected, that's when we're going to see the deaths and that's the most important thing we could try to prevent.\" Although 92% of those ages 65 and older received the first two doses of the vaccine, many of them have not stayed up to date with their boosters. About 70% received their third dose and only 40% have gotten their fourth shot since the FDA authorized it in February. People ages 50 and older who received a second booster dose were 14 times less likely to die from Covid than the unvaccinated, and three times less likely to die than people who had one booster dose, according to CDC data. Dr. Paul Offit, an infectious disease expert at Children's Hospital Philadelphia, said people ages 75 and older, people with serious medical conditions and those with compromised immune systems would benefit the most from getting a booster right now. Deaths from Covid have risen in particular among people ages 75 and older, according to the CDC. The CDC has also emphasized the importance of using therapeutics to protect people who simply cannot mount a strong immune response to the virus even with vaccination. Nearly 3% of U.S. adults have compromised immune systems, or about 7 million people ages 18 or older, according a survey published in 2016 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The CDC has emphasized the importance of administering an investigational antibody therapy called Evusheld for people ages 12 and older with moderate and severely compromised immune systems. Evusheld is administered as two injections, before Covid infection, every six months to prevent severe illness, according to the FDA. But only 450,000 courses of the medicine have been administered so far, according to the Health and Human Services Department. \"The goal moving forward here for this year, next year, five years and 10 years down the road is protecting the vulnerable,\" Offit said."},

But booking airfare on a certain day of the week isn't one of them, according to data from Google Flights. Booking mid-week \u2014 and especially Tuesdays around midnight \u2014 is often cited as the best time to purchase flights. But in the past five years, U.S. airfares purchased on Tuesdays, Wednesday or Thursdays have been only 1.9% cheaper on average than airfares purchased during the weekend, according to Google Flights. \"If your trip is just a couple of weeks away, don't wait for Tuesday to roll around \u2014 book your flight now in case the price goes up,\" wrote James Byers, Google Flights' group product manager, on a blog post published yesterday. While the day of the week travelers book may not matter much, the day they fly does, according to Google Flights' research, which examined five years of historical flight data from Aug. 1, 2017 to Aug. 1, 2022. \"On average, flights that depart on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday have been 12% cheaper than weekend departures,\" wrote Byers. \"If you exclude international destinations, the potential savings jump even higher to 20%.\" Another common strategy \u2014 booking early \u2014 also works, according to the data. For U.S. domestic flights, airfares have been lowest between three and eight weeks before a departure date, with prices \"bottoming out\" 44 days out, according to the research. Non-stop flights cost on average about 20% more than connecting flights, according to Google Flights, but flights with stops also increase the risk of interruptions. An Instagram poll by the travel insurance company World Nomads indicated more than 1 in 3 respondents spent up to $250 on flights, meals or hotels because of flight delays or cancellations this summer, while 12% reported spending between $500 to $1,000. Travelers with flexible flying days can use Google Flights' \"date grid\" function to quickly ascertain the cheapest dates to depart and arrive in a given week. Those who want to travel for a specific duration \u2014 say, two weeks \u2014 but are flexible on when, can use the \"price graph\" function to see the cheapest times to fly too. Price tracking also eliminates the need to search again and again to price-check a desired route.

It is the first time the FDA has authorized an updated vaccine formula since the original shots rolled out in December 2020. Pharmacies are expected to start administering the new boosters after Labor Day weekend. The U.S. has secured 171 million doses of Pfizer's and Moderna's updated shots so far, according to the Health and Human Services Department. Pfizer's new booster dose is authorized for people ages 12 and older, while Moderna's new shots are authorized for adults ages 18 and older. The eligible age groups can receive the boosters two months after completing their primary series or their most recent booster with the old shots. The U.S. will no longer use the original vaccines as booster doses for individuals ages 12 and older now that the the updated shots have been authorized, according to the FDA. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has to sign off on the boosters before pharmacies can give them to patients. The CDC's independent advisory committee is scheduled to meet Thursday and Friday to review the data and issue its recommendations for health-care providers. Public health officials believe the redesigned boosters will provide longer-lasting protection against the virus and reduce hospitalizations this fall and winter. The new boosters target both the original strain that emerged in China more than two years ago, which scientists refer to as the \"wild type,\" and omicron BA.4 and BA.5, which are now the dominant variants in the U.S. Shots that target two different strains are called bivalent vaccines. The vaccine makers developed the original shots against the strain of Covid that first emerged in Wuhan, China, in 2019. But the virus has mutated dramatically since then. Omicron and its subvariants have drifted so much from the original Covid strain that the virus is able to slip past the protective antibodies induced by the vaccines. As a consequence, the shots' effectiveness at preventing infection and mild illness has declined substantially as the virus has evolved. Though the vaccines are still generally preventing severe disease, the protection they provide against hospitalization has slipped over time as well. \"There is declining effectiveness against hospitalization and severe illness. The problem has been persuading the American people to get boosted on a regular basis,\" said Dr. Peter Hotez, an infectious disease expert at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas. Hotez led a team that developed a Covid vaccine based on protein technology that is authorized in India. About 76% of people ages 12 and older have received their first two vaccine doses in the U.S., according to CDC data. About 50% of those individuals have received their first booster dose. For adults ages 18 and older, three doses of Pfizer's or Moderna's original vaccines were 55% effective at preventing hospitalization from the omicron BA.2 subvariant four months after the third shot, according to CDC data. Three shots were 19% effective at preventing infection from omicron five months after the third shot, according to CDC data from August 2021 through May 2022. The rapidly spreading BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants have since driven omicron BA.2 out of circulation. Dr. Peter Marks, head of the FDA office responsible for reviewing vaccines, said the hope is that the updated boosters will restore the high level of protection against disease that vaccines demonstrated when they were first authorized in December 2020. \"We don't know for a fact yet whether we will get to that same level, but that is the goal here. And that is what we believe the evidence that we've seen helps point to,\" Marks told reporters during a news conference after the authorization Wednesday. The Biden administration moved rapidly over the summer to get updated shots ready for the fall. Public health officials are worried the U.S. is on the verge of another wave of infection as more transmissible omicron variants spread, immunity from the original vaccines wears off, and people head indoors to escape colder weather. Pfizer and Moderna were originally developing boosters to target omicron BA.1, the variant that caused the massive wave of infection last winter. But the FDA told the vaccine makers in late June to switch gears and target BA.4 and BA.5 instead as those variants quickly gained ground. The sudden change in plans left little time for clinical trials in humans before a fall rollout. As a consequence, the authorization is based on human clinical trials from the BA.1 shots, which produced a better immune response than the original doses, according to the FDA. But it's unclear how the BA.5 boosters will perform in humans since the data is based on BA.1. Marks said it will likely be at least another two months before human clinical data on the BA.5 shots is made available to the public. The most common side effects from the human trials of the BA.1 shots was pain, redness, swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headaches, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea, vomiting and fever, according to the FDA. The Covid vaccines also have a well-established safety profile after administration to millions of people over the course of the pandemic, the FDA said. In addition to human data from the BA.1 shots, the authorization was also based on animal studies from the BA.5 boosters, Marks said. In June, Pfizer also presented data to the FDA's independent vaccine advisory committee that showed the bivalent omicron BA.5 shots increased antibodies in mice that protect against infection by about 2.6-fold compared with the original vaccine. Marks said the FDA used the same process for the authorization that it relied on in the past for switching the strains in flu vaccines. \"We're pretty confident that or what we have is very similar to the situation that we've done in the past with influenza changes where we don't do clinical studies for them in the United States,\" Marks said. \"We know from the way the vaccine works, and from the data that we have, that we can predict how well the vaccine will be working.\" But some infectious disease and vaccine experts say the FDA should have waited for human data from the BA.5 shots before authorizing them. Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA's advisory committee, said data based on mice studies is not sufficient to justify authorizing the new boosters. \"You have to show some evidence in people that the immune response that you're getting with the bivalent vaccine is clearly better, and those data haven't been presented,\" said Offit, an infectious disease and vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \"You can't ask millions of people to get this booster dose without showing some human data that you have a dramatic increase in neutralizing antibodies to the BA.4/BA.5 strains as compared to boosting with the ancestral type,\" Offit said, referring to the currently authorized shots based on the version of Covid that emerged in China, more than two years ago. Michael Osterholm, a leading epidemiologist and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, also said more data needs to be presented on how the BA.5 shots perform in humans. \"It's not that I don't think it could work,\" Osterholm said. \"But I think we need the data first to show that the immune response to this vaccine is equivalent to or better than what we have already.\" But CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, in a radio interview, said waiting longer for human data from the BA.5 shots could mean the boosters become outdated if a new variant emerges. Walensky said the change in the vaccine formula is small and should not affect safety. \"There's always a question here of being too slow versus too fast,\" Walensky told \"Conversations on Health Care\" in a radio interview. \"One of the challenges is if we wait for those data to emerge in human data [...] we will be using what I would consider to be a potentially outdated vaccine.\""},

But it's unclear how much protection the new booster shots will provide. The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cleared the shots without any data from clinical trials that are testing the reformulated doses in humans. The new boosters, authorized for people ages 12 and older, target the highly contagious and immune-evasive omicron BA.5 subvariant that has caused a wave of breakthrough infections over the summer. The shots also target the original strain of the virus that first emerged in Wuhan, China, in 2019. The nation's top health officials acted with urgency this summer to ensure the new boosters would roll out in time for the fall. They are worried that the waning effectiveness of the old vaccines is creating an opening for omicron to cause another wave of hospitalizations this winter as people spend more time indoors where the airborne virus spreads more easily. Deaths and hospitalizations have climbed since April among the elderly, the most vaccinated age group in America, as omicron has continued to mutate into more and more transmissible subvariants that dodge the protection of the original vaccines, according to Heather Scobie, a CDC epidemiologist. Dr. Peter Marks, who heads the FDA office that reviews vaccines, said the new boosters aim to restore the high levels of protection that vaccines demonstrated in early 2021. But Marks acknowledged that the federal government's experts simply do not know yet whether the boosters will meet the high bar set by those doses. \"We don't know for a fact yet whether we will get to that same level, but that is the goal here. And that is what we believe the evidence that we've seen helps point to,\" Marks told reporters during a news conference after the FDA authorization Wednesday. The FDA will conduct surveillance to see whether the boosters meet that goal, Marks said. When Pfizer's and Moderna's shots were authorized in December 2020, they provided more than 90% protection at preventing Covid. Marks told reporters it will likely take at least another couple of months before human data on the BA.5 boosters is available to the public. But he said the FDA used basically the same process to authorize the new boosters that it has relied on for years to switch the virus strains in flu shots. \"We're pretty confident that what we have is very similar to the situation that we've done in the past with influenza changes where we don't do clinical studies for them in the United States,\" Marks said. \"We know from the way the vaccine works, and from the data that we have, that we can predict how well the vaccine will be working.\" The new boosters could prevent 2.4 million infections, 137,000 hospitalizations and 9,700 deaths if a new variant doesn't emerge, according to a projection by a team of scientists that forecasts the trajectory of the pandemic, called the Covid-19 Scenario Modeling Hub. But that projection is based on optimistic assumptions about booster coverage and efficacy, according to the scientists. The model assumes that the shots will prove 80% effective at preventing illness and the public will broadly embrace the new boosters. There is no efficacy data on the new shots and it's unclear how strong public demand will be for them. The CDC estimates that an early fall vaccination campaign with boosters could save the U.S. between $63 billion and $109 billion in medical costs by preventing hospitalizations and ICU admissions. Pfizer and Moderna were originally developing new boosters to target the first version of omicron, BA.1, that caused the massive wave of infection and hospitalization last winter. But keeping up with the rapid evolution of the virus has proved challenging. By the time the nation's top health leaders moved in earnest in April to get new boosters ready, more transmissible subvariants had already driven omicron BA.1 out of prevalence. In June, the FDA asked the vaccine makers to switch gears and target omicron BA.5 after it rose to dominance. This decision did not leave enough time for Pfizer and Moderna to complete human clinical trials on the new boosters before a fall vaccine rollout. As a consequence, the FDA and the CDC are relying on human data from the clinical trials of the BA.1 shots to understand how the BA.5 boosters might perform. They also relied on data from studies in which the BA.5 boosters were tested in mice. The CDC's independent advisory committee backed the shots on Thursday in an overwhelming vote. But several members of the panel also had reservations about the lack of human data. \"I really do struggle with a vaccine that has no clinical data that's reported for humans, for those that would be actually receiving the vaccine,\" said Dr. Oliver Brooks, a committee member and the chief medical officer at Watts HealthCare Corp. in Los Angeles. Dr. Pablo Sanchez, the only CDC committee member who voted against the shots, called the decision to recommend the new boosters without human data premature. \"There's a lot of vaccine hesitancy already \u2014 we need the human data,\" said Sanchez, a professor of pediatrics at Ohio State University. Dr. Doran Fink, deputy head of the FDA's vaccine review division, told hesitant committee members that the new booster shots use the exact same manufacturing process as the old vaccines and contain the same total amount of mRNA, the code that instructs human cells to produce the proteins that provoke an immune response to defend against Covid. Fink said the BA.1 and the BA.5 shots are similar enough to use data from the BA.1 human trials to get a good idea of how the new BA.5 boosters will perform. Pfizer and Moderna presented data at the CDC meeting which showed that the BA.1 shots triggered a stronger immune response in humans than the old vaccines. The mouse studies from both companies on the BA.5 shots also showed a stronger immune response. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky last week said waiting longer for human data from the BA.5 shots could mean the boosters become outdated if a new variant emerges. \"There's always a question here of being too slow versus too fast,\" Walensky told \"Conversations on Health Care\" in a radio interview. \"One of the challenges is if we wait for those data to emerge in human data ... we will be using what I would consider to be a potentially outdated vaccine.\" Moderna completed enrollment in its clinical trials last week and expects results by the end of the year. Pfizer's clinical trials are ongoing, though the company hasn't provided a time frame on when it will have data. Brooks questioned why the FDA decided to go with a BA.5 vaccine when clinical data is available for the BA.1 shots that the vaccine makers were originally developing. Canada and the United Kingdom have authorized new booster shots that target omicron BA.1 Fink said the U.S. selected BA.5 based on the advice of the FDA's independent committee, data from South Africa that indicated natural infection from the subvariant provides broader protection than infection from BA.1, and the fact that BA.5 is dominant. Though the committee members had some hesitation about proceeding without the human data, they agreed the new boosters should have a similar safety profile to the old vaccines because they use the same platform. The Covid vaccines have been administered to millions of people in the U.S. with mostly mild side effects. The most common side effects from the human trials of the BA.1 shots was pain, redness, swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headaches, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea, vomiting and fever, according to the FDA. Dr. Sara Oliver, a CDC official, told the committee that the risk of myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, after a BA.5 booster is unknown. But health officials anticipate it will be similar to the risk observed with the old vaccines. Pfizer's and Moderna's vaccines have been associated with an elevated risk of myocarditis in young men and adolescent boys mostly after the second dose. But the risk of myocarditis is higher from Covid infection than vaccination, according to the CDC. Dr. Grace Lee, the CDC committee chair, sought to reassure the public that there's a robust surveillance system to monitor safety, and that the panel will meet again if any new concerns emerge. \"I just want to make sure that the members of the public are aware that we're continuing to monitor closely,\" Lee said. \"We have systems and teams that are continuing to monitor and to meet.\""},

Norm Bafunno, who is senior vice president, unit manufacturing and engineering at Toyota Motor North America, said the announcement marked \"another significant milestone\" for the business. The additional investment in the U.S. is part of a wider investment of up to $5.6 billion in battery production, with Toyota noting that demand for battery electric vehicles was growing. To this end, the business said it would aim to ramp up \"combined battery production capacity\" in the U.S. and Japan by as much as 40 gigawatt hours. As well as diesel and gasoline vehicles, Toyota is known for its hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell offerings. It is also attempting to make headway in the increasingly competitive battery-electric market, where firms like Tesla and Volkswagen are jostling for position. This has not been without its challenges. In June 2022, Toyota issued a safety recall for more than 2,000 of its all-electric SUV, the bZ4X. Toyota may be looking to invest billions in EV battery production, but on Wednesday the business stressed it would also \"continue to make every effort to flexibly meet the needs\" of customers \"in all countries and regions by offering multiple powertrains and providing as many options as possible.\" Indeed, the website of Toyota Europe states that the \"internal combustion engine continues to be the most popular means of powering vehicles and it will continue to play a role for the next 20 to 30 years.\" All the above comes at a time when major economies are laying out plans to reduce the environmental footprint of road-based transportation. Just this month, the California Air Resources Board approved a rule that will require all new car sales in the state to be zero emission by the year 2035. Elsewhere, the U.K. wants to stop the sale of new diesel and gasoline cars and vans by 2030. It will require, from 2035, all new cars and vans to have zero-tailpipe emissions. The European Union \u2014 which the U.K. left on Jan. 31, 2020 \u2014 is pursuing similar targets. According to the International Energy Agency, electric vehicle sales hit 6.6 million in 2021. In the first quarter of 2022, EV sales came to 2 million, a 75% increase compared to the first three months of 2021."},

Explaining its decision, the company \u2014 one of several in England and Wales to have announced water usage limits in recent weeks \u2014 said extreme temperatures and this summer's heatwave had resulted in the highest demand for water in more than 25 years. \"The driest July since 1885, the hottest temperatures on record, and the River Thames reaching its lowest level since 2005 have led to a drop in reservoir levels in the Thames Valley and London,\" it said. The TUB does not apply to businesses, although Thames Water said it was asking those within its area \"to be mindful of the drought and to use water wisely.\" This could involve companies switching off water features on their premises and not washing their vehicles, it suggested. \"Implementing a Temporary Use Ban for our customers has been a very difficult decision to make and one which we have not taken lightly,\" Sarah Bentley, the Thames Water CEO, said. \"After months of below average rainfall and the recent extreme temperatures in July and August, water resources in our region are depleted,\" Bentley added. The announcement of the ban comes at a time when many water companies are facing criticism related to leaks from their pipes. For its part, Thames Water said it had teams focused on locating and fixing more than 1,100 leaks per week. When it comes to enforcement of the ban, the firm said it hoped and expected customers to continue using water wisely. \"If we become aware of customers ignoring the restrictions, we'll contact them to make sure they're aware of the rules and how to use water responsibly and wisely,\" it added. \"There are criminal offences for those that repeatedly ignore requests to comply with the ban.\" Last month saw temperatures in the U.K. surge, with highs of over 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) recorded for the first time ever. On Aug. 12, the U.K.'s Environment Agency announced that parts of England had moved into drought status. \"In drought affected areas the public and businesses should be very mindful of the pressures on water resources and should use water wisely,\" authorities said. They added that government expected water firms \"to act to reduce leakage and fix leaking pipes as quickly as possible and take wider action alongside government policy.\" The U.K. is not alone when it comes to drought-related issues. On July 18, the European Commission's Joint Research Centre published a report looking at drought in Europe. \"The severe drought affecting several regions of Europe since the beginning of the year continues expanding and worsening,\" it said. \"Dry conditions are related to a wide and persistent lack of precipitation combined with early heatwaves in May and June.\" In an interview with CNBC earlier this week, Bill Hare, CEO and senior scientist at research non-profit Climate Analytics, explained how the current conditions were having wide-ranging effects. \"On the water supply, it's clear that in the U.K. and other parts of Europe, we're seeing already very significant water stress that's beginning to affect \u2026 ordinary urban residents, not just farmers,\" he said. \"We're seeing the lack of availability for cooling water for thermal, nuclear or coal power stations, which is causing curtailment of power,\" Hare, who was speaking to CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche, said. \"This is a problem we're seeing all over the world,\" he added. \"We're seeing, also, issues for example in Germany, now in the Danube region, with low water flow, meaning you can't carry cargo anymore.\" This was in turn, \"having big implications not just for the transport of energy, but for agriculture, all manner of industrial commodities and so on.\""},

The agency's independent committee on vaccines voted 13 to 1 earlier Thursday in favor of the shots after reviewing the available safety and effectiveness data over an almost seven-hour-long meeting. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky signed off on the shots a few hours later, clearing the way for pharmacies to soon start administering the shots. Pfizer 's omicron boosters were OKed for people ages 12 and older, while Moderna 's updated shots were authorized for people ages 18 and older. The eligible age groups can receive the boosters at least two months after completing their primary series or their most recent booster with the old shots. Walensky said her decision followed \"a comprehensive scientific evaluation and robust scientific discussion.\" \"If you are eligible, there is no bad time to get your Covid-19 booster and I strongly encourage you to receive it,\" she said in a statement. Pfizer plans to ask the Food and Drug Administration to also authorize the new boosters for children ages 5 to 11 years old in early October, company executives told the committee Thursday. The original vaccines will no longer be used as a booster in people ages 12 and older now that the reformulated shots are coming online. Public health officials are expecting another wave of Covd infection this fall as immunity from the old vaccines wanes off, more contagious omicron subvariants spread, and people spend more time indoors as the weather turns colder and families gather for the holidays. The CDC and the FDA hope the new boosters will provide more durable protection against infection, mild illness and severe disease. The reformulated shots target omicron BA.5, the dominant variant of Covid as well as the strain that emerged in China more than two years ago. The U.S so far has secured 171 million doses of Pfizer's and Moderna's new boosters. More than 200 million people are eligible for the shots, according to the CDC. Dr. Sara Oliver, a CDC official, told the committee Thursday that there should be enough supply of the vaccine to meet demand this fall. There is no data from human trials on the new BA.5 boosters, so it's unclear how they will perform in the real world. The CDC and FDA used human data from clinical trials for shots targeting the original version of omicron, BA.1, which triggered a stronger immune response than the old vaccines. Pfizer and Moderna were originally developing omicron boosters to target BA.1, but the FDA asked the companies to switch gears in June and develop BA.5 shots instead after the subvariant became dominant. The decision to focus on BA.5 did not leave enough time to wait for data from human trials ahead of a fall vaccine rollout. The lack of human data for the BA.5 shots has caused some controversy, but Dr. Peter Marks, a senior FDA official, said the agency followed the same process used for years with strain changes for flu vaccines. Marks said on Wednesday that flu vaccine strains are also changed without human clinical data. Dr. Pablo Sanchez, the only committee member who voted against the shots, called the recommendation premature and said the U.S. should have waited for human data before proceeding with the boosters. \"There's a lot of vaccine hesitancy already \u2014 we need the human data,\" said Sanchez, a professor of pediatrics at Ohio State University. But Sanchez said he believes the new boosters are safe and he will likely receive one himself. Panel member Dr. Oliver Brooks, chief medical officer at Watts HealthCare Corporation in Los Angeles, questioned why the FDA decided to go with a BA.5 vaccine when clinical data is available for the BA.1 shots that the vaccine makers were originally developing. Brooks ended up voting in favor the shots. But Dr. Sarah Long, also a committee member, said there's no reason to expect the BA.5 boosters will be inferior to the old shots since they also include the original Covid strain, and they have potential to reduce hospitalizations and deaths heading into the fall and winter. Long also voted in favor. Officials at the FDA and CDC have said the omicron BA.1 and omicron BA.5 boosters are similar enough that the immune response data from the BA.1 shot should give a good indication of how the BA.5 shots will perform. Omicron BA.1 and BA.5 are closely related with a four-mutation difference, according to Dr. Jacqueline Miller, who works on vaccine development at Moderna. Moderna completed enrollment in clinical trials on the BA.5 shots last week and should have results by the end of the year, Miller told the CDC committee on Thursday. Pfizer's clinical trial is also ongoing, though company hasn't said when it expects results. The health agencies also reviewed data on the BA.5 shots from mouse studies. Moderna presented data showing that the BA.5 shots increased antibodies in mice more than fourfold compared with the old shots. The mice express the same cell protein as humans that the virus latches onto. Pfizer's BA.5 booster increased antibodies 2.6 fold in mice compared with the original vaccine. The most common side effects from the human trials of the BA.1 shots was pain, redness, swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headaches, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea, vomiting and fever, according to the FDA. Oliver, the CDC official, told the committee that health officials do not expect any difference in the safety profile of the BA.1 and BA.5 shots given that subvariants differ only by a few mutations. But Oliver noted that the risk of myocarditis following a BA.5 booster shot is unknown. There is an elevated risk of myocarditis among young men and adolescent boys following the second dose of Pfizer's and Moderna's shots but the risk of myocarditis from Covid infection is higher, according to the CDC. \"We know that the myocarditis risk is unknown but anticipate a similar risk to that seen after the monovalent vaccines,\" Oliver said. The monovalent vaccines are the old shots that have been administered to millions of people in the U.S. over the past two years. The original vaccines, which were first authorized in December 2020, are no longer providing meaningful protection against infection because the virus has mutated so much over the past two years. The shots were developed against the first strain that emerged in China, so they are no longer matched to target the omicron subvariants that are spreading. Infections, hospitalizations and deaths have declined dramatically since the massive wave of omicron infection last winter, but have plateaued this summer at a stubbornly high level. Omicron BA.5 is the most contagious and immune evasive variant yet, and breakthrough infections have become increasingly common as a consequence. The old vaccines effectiveness against hospitalization also declined after omicron BA.5 became dominant. A third dose was 77% effective at prevention hospitalization four months after receiving the shot, but protection declined after 120 day to as low as 34%, according to CDC data. A fourth dose in people ages 50 and older was 56% effective at preventing hospitalization after four months. Deaths and hospitalizations from Covid among people ages 65 and older have increased since April, according to Heather Scobie, a CDC epidemiologist who presented data during Thursday's meeting. Deaths have risen in particular among people ages 75 and older, Scobie said. The CDC has shifted to a more targeted public health response with an emphasis on protecting the most vulnerable \u2014 the elderly, people with serious medical conditions and those who have weak immune systems. Although there's no data on the real-world effectiveness of the new boosters, the U.S. is moving rapidly to roll them out in the hope that they will protect people this fall."},

The sister of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was speaking at the Global Supertrends Conference 2022 on Wednesday. The Web3 is a hypothetical, future version of the internet based on blockchain technology \u2014 an \"ideal utopia,\" said Zuckerberg. \"But \u2026 that's not what's happening. What's happening in reality, is chaos.\" The founder and CEO of Zuckerberg Media, a production company and marketing consultancy, added, \"You're the only one watching your own back and your own assets, people are spending time protecting themselves by setting up so many different wallets and protecting their identity and that's not contributing to development in the area.\" Zuckerberg, who was an early employee at Meta \u2014 formerly known as Facebook \u2014 explained that various metaverses are now acting as \"their own walled garden,\" in which users are unable to use their assets across platforms. The metaverse can be loosely defined as a virtual world where people live, work and play. With cryptocurrency, users can buy and develop virtual land or dress their own avatars. \"Right now, I'm on Decentraland, my son is on Roblox, my other son is on Fortnite. That's great \u2014 we're all in the metaverse. [But] we have no interaction with one another,\" she said. \"In order to really unlock the potential [of Web3], we're going to need to figure out a system where there's interoperability. What you have goes with you wherever you are, [and] we're not there yet,\" Zuckerberg added. However, according to Zuckerberg, that's easier said than done because no company running a metaverse right now wants to give up control or \"share that ownership.\" \"That's why it's not we're not seeing that kind of consumer mainstream adoption yet because there needs to be a world where you leave the house with one wallet. And you need to see that same behavior online also.\" She added that Web3 needs experts who have been involved in the global banking system and Web2 \u2014 the internet that we know today \u2014 to lend a \"protective layer.\" The need for such experts is all the more important because it has been \"too easy\" for users to be scammed or lose all their assets in Web3, said Zuckerberg. \"There needs to be more protections for consumers \u2026 I think we will wind up [with] web 2.7, where there is some centralization, keeping people safe, but the ability to port your assets with you to any site.\" Another thing that needs to be improved in Web3 is user-friendliness, she added. \"It should not take 45 steps to set up a cryptocurrency wallet, buy a currency and enter the metaverse. It needs to [be] one-stop, beginner-friendly.\" The metaverse may still be in its infancy, but Zuckerberg pointed out that sectors like real estate will be \"extremely valuable.\" \"Wherever there's scarcity \u2026 there's value. I think the big question will just be, is there scarcity in the metaverse and if there is, there will be value in real estate there,\" she added. According to data from MetaMetrics Solutions, real estate sales in the metaverse surpassed $500 million in 2021 and could double in 2022. Zuckerberg said that education and training will be another \"huge area\" for opportunities and revenue. \"Especially in this new age where workers are remote, it is very difficult to upskill remote workers \u2026 I think training in the metaverse, education in an interactive way, is going to become crucial for every business that has a remote work,\" she added. \"We're really just scratching the surface of what we're going to see.\""},

The local government approvals allow Baidu's Apollo Go robotaxi business to eliminate the cost of human personnel in some instances. The initial scale of the permits is small: 10 robotaxis divided between two suburban areas of Wuhan and Chongqing, two major Chinese cities. In April, Baidu and rival robotaxi operator Pony.ai received approval from a Beijing suburban district to operate robotaxis without a human driver. But the Chinese capital still requires human staff to sit in the robotaxi with passengers. Municipal authorities across China have issued an increasing number of permits in the last year that allow robotaxi companies to operate and charge fares in selected areas. In the U.S., Alphabet's Waymo and General Motors ' subsidiary Cruise can already run public robotaxis with no human staff in the vehicles. Laws for testing robotaxis and charging riders vary by city and state. Baidu claimed it has received more than one million orders for robotaxi rides.

He was speaking at the 2022 Global Supertrends Conference. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced in May that the country will take firm steps to restart idled nuclear power plants to stabilize energy supply and prices. In 2011, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami, which killed nearly 16,000 people and caused the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986. Though there have been reservations among the Japanese public over the use of nuclear energy, particularly when it comes to the issue of safety, Tanaka said the future of nuclear power is now safer, and stressed the importance of minimizing risk and maintaining \"peaceful use.\" Tanaka attributed the increase in public support to the possibility of \"serious problems by the end of this year\" if Japan does not have nuclear power. He added that Russia supplies 9% of Japan's natural gas, and losing that supply could spell trouble for the country as it would have to turn to alternative sources, which would lead to a spike in energy prices. Japan has repeatedly criticized Russian aggression in Ukraine and has slapped Moscow with economic sanctions. In response, Russia sanctioned over 300 Japanese lawmakers in July. Russia recently cut gas supplies to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to just a fifth of its capacity. Moscow has repeatedly denied it is weaponizing fossil fuel supplies over the Russia-Ukraine war. Tanaka said that Japan wants to secure energy supplies but also work toward reaching carbon neutrality by 2050, and striking that balance could prove increasingly challenging. Nuclear power has been touted as an important option for decarbonization.\n\"Japan is trying to secure the supply of energy, especially electricity, while trying to maintain the targets of carbon neutral by 2050 intact.

{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/26/action-on-climate-change-can-boost-global-economy-economist-says.html", "title": "Action on climate change can provide a shot in the arm for the global economy, economist says", "paragraphs": " Ramping up investment in policies and technologies to tackle climate change could play a significant role in the global economy's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. In a recent note, Charles Dumas, chief economist at U.K.-based investment research firm TS Lombard, said that action on climate change is often criticized as moving too slowly. However, with governments increasing spending to aid their post-Covid economies, they may start catching up. A key tenet of this is the ever-decreasing cost of electricity per megawatt hour, according to figures from TS Lombard, with costs of solar, offshore and onshore wind dropping over the last 10 years, while gas and coal have remained largely the same. \"Effectively by 2030 the cost of renewable electricity is going to be half that of coal and gas sourced electricity,\" Dumas told CNBC. These trends will bring many of the various pledges to reach net zero more closely in sight. The fatal floods in Germany in recent weeks have put the impacts of climate change firmly in the spotlight again but they are only the latest in a series of devastating extreme weather events of late, including the sprawling wildfires in Oregon. Amid this backdrop, the United Nations Climate Change Conference, better known as COP26, will meet in Glasgow in November. It will mark one of the most significant multilateral meetings on climate since the Paris agreement. Dumas said that as COP26 approaches, governments need to understand their key priorities, and among them should be infrastructure investments as numerous technological and engineering challenges continue to obstruct renewable energy. \"I think the intermittency problem is pretty serious and it's not just that the sun goes down at night,\" Dumas said. In the case of solar power, output can be mixed depending on the location of infrastructure like solar farms. \"There's huge variation with sunny days in winter and sunny days in the middle of summer so the intermittency takes on a very big seasonal aspect,\" Dumas said. \"You can have vicious weather for a long time in the middle of December or January and lo and behold you wouldn't want to be depending on solar power.\" Energy transmission could be another bottleneck, he said. While the developing world, including several African nations, has great potential in developing sites for generating solar power, that power needs to move easily. \"The issue of transmission technology is really major. If you want Chad to be the new Saudi Arabia, because of the Sahara Desert there's a lot of sun there, but you want the electricity to be used in Europe then you're talking about some expensive processes and processes needing a lot of research and a lot of further investment.\" Storage and carbon capture are all areas that require hefty investment, Dumas added, if governments are to reach their net-zero targets. \"What we need is a very clear public policy lead in order to get anywhere near these net zero promises and I suspect that actually what it's going to be about is a carbon tax, which the Americans may resist but will be necessary,\" he said. Paul Steele, chief economist at an independent policy research institute called the International Institute for Environment and Development, said that climate action and renewable energy investments will serve the dual purpose of tackling the climate crisis while creating jobs for the post-Covid economy. \"One of the priorities coming out of Covid is to create labor intensive employment. Both in developed and developing countries, you can provide labor intensive employment through renewable energy,\" Steele said. One example, he said, was the retrofitting of boilers in homes in the U.K., which would help push the country toward its climate targets and create new jobs while being relatively inexpensive in the grand scheme of things. Steele said that investments to drive a climate-friendly economy cannot be short term or have quick goals. He pointed to the various government support schemes for the airline industry, which has been battered by the pandemic. Just this week, the European courts gave the nod to a $2.9 billion bailout for Air France-KLM's Dutch business. Bailout funds like these should be tied to sustainability commitments by the airline industry, he said, but that can be a dicey proposition to get over the line. \"Governments aren't making the connections enough and traditionally treasuries and particularly the ministries of transport are still dominated by road building lobbies and people who like to build highways and increase transport rather than people who want to invest in sustainable alternatives.\"  "},

As economies reopened after the pandemic, companies in the hospitality, retail and entertainment sectors ramped up hiring, said Feon Ang, Asia-Pacific managing director at the professional networking platform. All three countries saw an increase in job postings on LinkedIn for jobs in the accommodation sector, such as hotels, motels, casino hotels and bed-and-breakfast inns. According to data collected by LinkedIn, paid job postings for careers in Australia, India and Singapore increased in June compared to a year ago, with the following sectors seeing the most growth: 1. Accommodation, up 62%\n2. Retail jobs, up 46%\n3. Financial services, up 25% 1. Accommodation, up 65%\n2. Construction, up 40%\n3. Real estate and equipment rental services, up 25% 1. Accommodation, up 15%\n2. Transport and logistics, up 31%\n3. Entertainment providers (businesses involved in performances, events, and exhibitions), up 100% However, jobs in Singapore's health care, education and construction industries were all down by more than 30%, according to LinkedIn. Ang noted that the cutback of job postings for Singapore's construction sector was likely due to measures introduced by the government to cool the private and residential property market. Although there's an increase in hiring rates across the three countries, there was less competition among job seekers in June compared to one year ago, LinkedIn data showed. On average, there was a more than a 50% drop in applications for paid job postings on LinkedIn in Australia, India and Singapore \"Even as job postings rise, workers are being more selective in picking their next role, and so competition for jobs on average is down,\" said Ang. \"This means that workers are in a position to demand more out of work, and have higher expectations of what they want in a job \u2013 and that's a healthy sign,\" she added. In both Australia and Singapore, paid job postings that offered remote work options fell. Paid listings in Australia fell by 8% in June compared to a year ago, although sentiment for flexible working arrangements was still strong. Opportunities that offered remote working options received two times more applications on average, according to LinkedIn. In Singapore, paid job postings that allowed employees to work from home fell from 8% in the first quarter to 6.7% in the second quarter. But unlike employees in Australia, LinkedIn observed that interest in flexible working arrangements seemed to be waning in Singapore. Employers in India felt differently, according to the data. Paid job postings in the South Asian country which offered remote work options remained relatively constant throughout the year and there wasn't particularly more interest in jobs with remote options. \"Postings with remote options received only 1.1x more applications on average relative to their absolute share of all job postings in both quarters,\" said LinkedIn."},

A new study compared prices to find out", "paragraphs": " Many travelers try to save money by searching the internet for cheaper hotel rates. But a new study suggests it may not be worth the time \u2014 at least in some places. The travel insurance comparison site InsureMyTrip compared rates for 950 hotels in 19 global cities on three popular booking websites as well as each hotel's site. According to the results published last week, Hotels.com had the best overall rates \u2014 but just barely. Hotels.com had the best rates in 620 instances, which was slightly higher than Expedia, which had the cheapest rates in 579 instances. Booking directly with a hotel was more expensive, but by only about $6 more on average, according to the study. \"There have been conflicting views on hotel rates, and people ... believe that booking through online travel platforms ensured a better rate than the hotel website,\" said Shalabh Arora, director of marketing at India's Four Seasons Hotel Bengaluru. \"However, it's not so at Four Seasons where rate parity is taken very seriously.\" He said the hotels' website has a pop-up function which compares rates offered by the hotel with those on other booking platforms. Finally, the website Booking.com had the cheapest rates in 72 instances \u2014 or about 7% of the time \u2014 according to the study. \"Not only was [Booking.com] rarely the most affordable, but it was also the most expensive option the majority of the time,\" according to the published results. The company's Managing Director for Asia Pacific Laura Houldsworth responded to the study by email, stating that the company aims \"to always be transparent with our customers\" and that \"our property partners are free to set their own prices on Booking.com.\" She added that \"our promise to price match also means that if a customer should ever find a lower price on another website, Booking.com will refund the difference.\" The report found average hotel rates on Hotels.com and Expedia were the same in seven of 19 cities, with overall averages varying by just 27 cents. \"Expedia and Hotels.com often had the same price, especially with the international hotels,\" said Sarah Webber, director of marketing for InsureMyTrip. Both brands are owned by Expedia Group, which also operates other travel booking websites, including Travelocity, Hotwire, Orbitz and CheapTickets. \"Hotels working with Expedia Group distribute their rates across all of our brands,\" said Anna Brown, a company public relations manager. \"The rate is similar across brands, however various offers ... approved by our hotel partners, sometimes create rate differences.\" Brown said rates can also vary through brands' app-only pricing, while Hotwire's \"Hot Rates\" mask hotels' names prior to purchase in exchange for deep discounts on last-minute bookings. Booking.com is part of Booking Holdings, which operates Priceline, Agoda and Kayak. Booking Holdings had the highest revenue among all online travel agencies from 2019 to 2021, according to the research company Statista. The InsureMyTrip report showed significant rate differences in certain cities. For instance, travelers could save as much as $88 per night in Honolulu, if they found the lowest price. In New York, the report found average hotel rates varied from $293 on Hotels.com to $367 on Booking.com. The study also found: But rate fluctuations were less pronounced outside of the United States. Posted rates varied less than $10 per night on average in Hong Kong, Bangkok, Macau, Kuala Lumpur and Istanbul, according to the research. InsureMyTrip's study represents a snapshot in time, with the research analyzing rates for a double room for two people booked for the night of Aug. 27, 2022, the firm said. All searches were conducted on the same day to avoid price fluctuations, since \"prices can change quickly and without warning,\" said Webber. However, the study did not consider whether rates were refundable or included taxes, said Webber. \"To keep the study as simple as possible, we took the price seen on the sites as the final cost,\" she said. \"So, it's definitely something to consider as not all hotels or booking sites include the same extras in the final price.\" Other factors, such as prepayment requirements and breakfast inclusions, can affect rates too, which further complicates the hotel price comparison process \u2014 for researchers and travelers alike."},

The world's biggest long-haul carrier will be retrofitting over 120 aircraft with new interiors, as well as dishing up menus with new vegan options and cinema snacks like popcorn, Emirates said in a statement.\nOther new perks for the carrier's first-class travelers include unlimited portions of Persian caviar, paired with Dom Perignon vintage champagne. Those investments come just as Emirates posted a $1.1 billion loss for the year ended March 31. \"While others respond to industry pressures with cost cuts, Emirates is flying against the grain and investing to deliver ever better experiences to our customers,\" said the president of Emirates airline, Tim Clark. Emirates is not the only airline pulling out all the stops to ride the tailwinds of \"revenge travel\" \u2014 the idea that people are making up for time \"lost\" during the pandemic to travel again. Earlier this year, Finnair launched a new line of premium economy cabins, featuring seats that provide around 50% more space than their economy seats. Air France, likewise, announced new long-haul business seats in May, complete with sliding dividers for passengers who want their own private space.\nEmirates told CNBC that it has seen \"a lot of interest\" in these luxury upgrades, though it said it does not have the full numbers yet. The upgrades come on the heels of an industry report predicting that business travel spending will return to pre-pandemic levels in 2026 rather than 2024, as previously forecast. Though spending by business travelers has been on the upswing, the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) annual report stated that the 2021 figure was still less than half of the over $1.4 trillion that was generated by in business travel in 2019. One travel analytics company, however, noted a shift in demand toward premium seats. \"During the pandemic, we saw that the numbers of people travelling by air collapsed. However, the proportion of travelers flying in premium cabins increased significantly,\" Olivier Ponti of ForwardKeys told CNBC in an email.\nPonti said that before the pandemic, the split between premium and economy seats was a ratio of 13:87, compared with 17:83 in 2022.\n\"While there's no guarantee that the shift towards premium seats will be maintained as air travel recovers, one can understand why the airlines would want to invest in keeping hold of premium passengers, who, this year have typically spent 575% more on a seat than those flying economy.\" Others are skeptical, however. Edward Russell, an editor at Skift, a travel industry news site, told CNBC it's unclear how much of an effect \"small\" product changes will have on sales. \"Most travelers either fly the airline, or alliance, where they have loyalty, or opt for the cheapest fare. It is only a small subset of travelers who will actually book a flight based on the addition of a sliding door or unlimited caviar.\""},

Here are their stories. Job: Emmy-award winning TV host of \" Samantha Brown's Places to Love\"\nStarted in: Comedy \" I went to Syracuse University for musical theater because I so desperately wanted to move to New York City and become a thespian. I wanted to do Shakespeare and be on Broadway. That didn't pan out. I waited on tables for a good eight years. But I loved improv, and I was a part of an improv comedy troupe. So I just kept auditioning for jobs. A writer recommended me to a production company that was \u2026 looking for a host. But my audition for it had to be totally improvised. That's how I got the job. When you are a travel host, there's no script. Yet it is still up to you to define the scene, to understand the trajectory of a story and how to end it. Also in improv, the golden rule is to never say no, it's always yes \u2014 to keep things going. Waiting on tables in New York City for eight years, you start to be really humbled, [but] those were the tools that I had that got me a job that I never in my wildest dreams thought I would ever have.\" Job: Creator of \" Strictly Dumpling\" and other YouTube channels (total: about 8 million subscribers)\nStarted in: Accounting and wedding videography \"I moved to the U.S. from China when I was 8 years old. My parents started working in restaurants, and eventually started their own very Americanized Chinese restaurant. So I grew up on a steady diet of General Tso's chicken and crab rangoon. There wasn't a lot of diversity where I'm from, but it helped that my parents sent me back to China when I was 13. Most people get grounded and sent to their room as a punishment \u2014 I got sent to China for two years. That's when I was like: Wow, it's so amazing \u2014 the people, the history \u2014 I want to know more. After college, I went to New York and worked on Wall Street for a year. Then I became a wedding videographer because I wanted to be flexible. I was living in a small basement apartment in Brooklyn with no air conditioning, making about $400 \u2014 on a good week. But this was the first time I was eating something that wasn't Red Lobster and Olive Garden. I got a taste of diverse ethnic food in Chinatown, and I started to discover a lot of my heritage that I never really saw as important before. I started recording food videos on YouTube as a food diary for myself. I remember having a conversation with a friend that food content will never amount to anything. There wasn't anybody online doing it. I had like 10 subscribers. Somehow it grew to this, which was never expected. I never really had much money growing up \u2014 or throughout most of my adulthood. So I was always looking for things that were inexpensive but also really filling and delicious. And that's pretty much what I do around the world now.\" Job: Television host of \" Family Travel with Colleen Kelly\"\nStarted in: Sales \"I tried out for the broadcast school at the University of Texas. The school gave you one chance to be accepted into the program. I had never sat at an anchor desk with a camera pointed at me. I failed miserably. Several years later, I graduated and got my first job in sales, eventually moving to Chicago and working in the pharmaceutical industry. The money was amazing, and I had a company car. But I wasn't living my dream, and this started to really bother me. In my early 30s, I got married and eventually quit my job to be a stay-at-home mom. One day, when my two little girls were in school, I went to our town hall's cable TV station and asked if, in exchange for teaching me how to edit, I could host the local entertainment show about our village \u2014 something like \"Access Hollywood\" for our 50,000-resident town. Because they had no other offers, they said yes. I acted confident, but I was as green as they come. I was shaking in my boots every time I did an interview and read voice-over, but I was gaining experience and knowledge. I confided in another mom that my dream was to host a national travel show, and, surprisingly, she agreed to produce it with me. We wrote a script, found a local camera guy for a few dollars and made a pilot. I took meetings with two major companies \u2014 both said no. I was told by one network that women don't watch travel shows, so the concept of family travel didn't appeal to them. I then sent thousands of emails to television stations. Nothing worked. Finally, my mother suggested I call the local PBS station. I googled the head of programming, called him (no emails) and got a meeting. After more meetings, we learned PBS was picking two shows to go national, and \"Family Travel with Colleen Kelly\" was one of them. We scraped by for a year, producing 13 episodes that first season. Now, the show has been on for more than 10 years. And, the best part is that I can bring my family with me. It's been a long and arduous journey, but I hope this story inspires others to believe in themselves, ignore the naysayers, and never give up on their dream.\" Editor's note: These interviews have been edited for length and clarity."},

But they still have options", "paragraphs": " There was a time when Western Europe was the destination of choice for Russian tourists. But things have changed. Max, a Russian in his 40s, used to stroll museums in France, enjoy fine cuisine in Italy, and go on hikes on the hills of Spain. Then Russia invaded Ukraine. This year, Max, who told CNBC that he's not comfortable sharing his last name, \"did not even consider\" Europe as a vacation destination. \"I am aware of the problems with obtaining visas to European countries,\" he said. Last week, the European Union agreed to suspend a 2007 travel agreement with Moscow which facilitated the issuance of visas to Russians. The move will make it more difficult and expensive for Russians to travel to the bloc. The closure of EU airspace to Russian airlines in February also made traveling difficult. \" The bad irony is that I am absolutely against the war and Putin, but I also experience travel difficulties,\" Max said. \"In the future, when Putin leaves and we become a normal country again, I hope that I will be able to visit Europe again. I love Italy very much.\" Max is one of many Russians who traded European holiday destinations for other countries this summer. EU countries like Italy, Spain, Cyprus and Greece were among the top 20 destinations most booked by Russian travelers before the war's outbreak, according to data from ForwardKeys, a travel data company. However, Olivier Ponti of ForwardKeys said Russian air travel to Europe over the summer was just 26% of what it was in 2019. \"Russia's invasion of Ukraine has certainly restricted the holiday choices of its citizens, as direct flights to many popular destinations have been banned,\" he said. \"It is still possible for Russians to visit Europe, but they now need to change planes in places like Istanbul or Dubai.\" According to ForwardKeys, which examined flight arrival data, several leisure destinations saw an increase in the market share of Russian visitors in June, July and August compared to 2019. Most of those countries were popular with Russian visitors before the war too. According to the Economic Intelligence Unit (EIU), Turkey was the top destination for Russian tourists in 2019, followed by the Russia-occupied territory of Abkhazia, the UAE and Maldives. Analysts from the EIU told CNBC that the Maldives has long been a preferred destination for wealthy Russians who can easily obtain tourist visas on arrival to stay up to 90 days. A more favorable exchange rate in Turkey since mid-March likely boosted travel numbers there, EIU analysts Mario Bikarski and Federica Reccia told CNBC. The Turkish lira currently stands at 18.23 against the dollar\u2014 near record lows after Turkey's central bank slashed its benchmark rates in August despite inflation being near 80%. Still, Russians' ability to travel may be further curtailed, they said. In addition to the EU's suspension of its 2007 preferential visa agreement with Moscow, Bikarski and Reccia said, economic problems could discourage Russians from traveling. \"As the war grinds on, we also expect the deteriorating economic outlook to weigh on Russians' propensity to travel.\""},
{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/07/dr-oz-has-ties-to-hydroxychloroquine-companies-as-he-backs-covid-treatment.html", "title": "Dr. Oz owns shares of companies that supply hydroxychloroquine, a drug he has backed as a Covid treatment", "paragraphs": " Republican Pennsylvania Senate candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz has financial ties to at least two pharmaceutical companies that supply hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug that he has floated as a possible Covid-19 treatment. Oz, a physician and veteran television show host who is facing Democrat John Fetterman in the race for Pennsylvania's open Senate seat, owns along with his wife at least $615,000 in shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific, according to his financial disclosure. Thermo Fisher Scientific's website lists hydroxychloroquine sulfate as one of its available products. It is unclear when Oz and his wife bought the stock, or whether they owned it as Oz promoted hydroxychloroquine as a Covid treatment early in the pandemic. Oz and his wife also own between $15,001 and $50,000 in McKesson Corporation stock, according to the disclosure. The company labels and distributes hydroxychloroquine sulfate, according to the FDA. It is also unclear when they bought McKesson stock. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is the anti-malaria drug commonly known as hydroxychloroquine, according to the Food and Drug Administration. Doctors around the country, in part boosted by endorsements from former President Donald Trump and conservative media figures, have offered the medication to patients as a Covid treatment despite its questionable efficacy against the virus. Oz's financial ties to a producer and distributor of the drug, and his promotion of it as a potential Covid treatment, raise questions about what he stood to gain from its wider use during the pandemic. If he wins the Senate election, he could also face conflicts of interest as Congress grapples with a still evolving coronavirus pandemic. In a statement responding to CNBC questions about Oz's relationships with companies that make or distribute hydroxychloroquine, including when he and his wife bought the Thermo Fisher Scientific stock, Oz campaign spokeswoman Brittany Yanick did not address the candidate's financial holdings. \"At the outset of the pandemic, Dr. Mehmet Oz spoke with health experts worldwide who were seeing hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as viable treatment options for desperately ill COVID patients. He offered to fund the clinical trial at Columbia University,\" she said. The FDA has approved hydroxychloroquine to fight malaria, but warned it has \"not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing COVID-19.\" Oz took bold steps early in the pandemic to promote its usage as a treatment. He urged Trump administration officials in 2020 to back a study he aimed to fund at the Columbia University Medical Center about the effect of hydroxychloroquine on Covid-19 patients, according to emails obtained and released by the House select subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis. Oz also has ties to third company that says it divested hydroxychloroquine from their U.S. portfolio. Sanofi, which is headquartered in France and previously made hydroxychloroquine, for years supported Oz's nonprofit, HealthCorps, according to the group's annual disclosure reports. Between 2009 and 2018, Sanofi was listed as either a sponsor or in-kind supporter of the Oz-funded group, which promotes itself as aiming to help teens with their health and wellness. In 2013, Sanofi is listed as one of the group's \"school sponsors.\" HealthCorps' website says a school sponsor must donate $100,000 to qualify. Sanofi announced in April 2020 that it would donate 100 million doses of hydroxychloroquine to 50 countries around the world as studies assessed the drug's efficacy in treating Covid-19. A spokesman for Sanofi told CNBC that the company has no involvement with Oz's comments about Covid-19 or hydroxychloroquine. He explained that Sanofi divested hydroxychloroquine from its U.S. portfolio in 2013 and investigated the use of the drug at the start of the Covid pandemic as a possible way to fight the virus. Once it was deemed ineffective against Covid-19, the company's work on it ceased. The spokesman also explained that the company's last financial contribution to HealthCorps came in 2011. The company representative later corrected himself in a follow up email to CNBC after publication of this story and said that 2013, was, in fact, the last year Sanofi gave a financial donation to HealthCorps. Oz's ties to companies that would benefit from wider use of hydroxychloroquine could pose issues for the Republican if he wins the Senate seat. Kedric Payne, an ethics attorney at the Campaign Legal Center, told CNBC in an email that Oz could choose to divest from the companies if he were to defeat Fetterman in November. \"He may be in for a rude awakening if elected because ethics rules could bar him from this activity. Senators cannot use their positions to promote any goods or services that financially benefit them,\" Payne said. \"Oz could voluntarily divest the stock if elected or stop promoting anything tied to his stock.\" A spokesman for Thermo Fisher Scientific declined to comment. A representative for McKesson did not return a request for comment before publication. Since he launched his campaign late last year, Oz has downplayed warnings by the FDA and other experts against using hydroxychloroquine as a Covid treatment. He suggested political animus against Trump, who endorsed the drug as a treatment and Oz in the Senate election, motivated criticism of the drug as a means to fight Covid. \"Now, let me just say this real quick, I really don't know if it works or not, we still to this day had not been able to prove if it [hydroxychloroquine] works or not, which is a shame, because we should have known by now if a cheap 70-year-old drug used by a billion people works or not,\" Oz said at a campaign rally earlier this year. \"But we don't, which is a problem by itself. However, I mentioned it and then President Trump mentioned it in a press conference, and all of a sudden the entire world hated hydroxychloroquine without testing it, without knowing about it.\" Before he launched his campaign, Oz more explicitly championed hydroxychloroquine. During a Fox News interview in March 2020 at the height of the pandemic, Oz said that \"hydroxychloroquine plays a role\" in fighting the virus. A graphic on screen while Oz was being interviewed called the anti-malaria drug \"promising\" as a Covid-19 treatment option. Oz also sought the White House's help in kickstarting the hydroxychloroquine study he hoped to fund at Columbia, where he was once vice chair of the surgery department. He has since said the study never got off the ground. The Pennsylvania candidate's communications with White House officials were released by the House select subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis last month. In a March 2020 email to former Trump White House coronavirus response coordinator Deborah Birx, Oz said he would recruit patients and pay for the hydroxychloroquine trial himself. Also in March 2020, Oz emailed Trump's son in law and advisor Jared Kushner that \"we must make completion of this study a national priority and insist on immediate enrollment,\" according to the correspondence obtained and made public by the House committee. Kushner responded to Oz on the same day, \"What do u recommend to speed it up?\" The New York Post reports that Oz spent $8,800 at that time on hydroxychloroquine tablets for the study and offered to spend $250,000. Oz, while campaigning for Pennsylvania's Senate seat, blamed then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for halting the study after he effectively banned the anti-malaria drug as a Covid treatment. Oz's financial ties could become a bigger issue for him if he wins the Pennsylvania race, one of a handful of contests that will decide which party controls the Senate next year. A Real Clear Politics polling average shows Fetterman leading Oz by almost 7 percentage points. Stock ownership in Congress is facing increased scrutiny. Some lawmakers have proposed a ban on individual stock trades in Congress, which would require lawmakers to put assets in a blind trust or divest entirely. Business Insider has identified at least 71 lawmakers who have violated the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, or STOCK Act. The law aims to stop members of Congress from trading stocks off of insider information gained from their work as lawmakers. However, members of Congress have broadly faced few repercussions for lucrative stock trades."},

Demetre Daskalakis, deputy head of the White House monkeypox response team, said it took 25 days for cases to double in August, down from eight days in July. California, New York, Illinois and Texas have all seen significant declines in new cases over the past month, Daskalakis said. \"The positive trends that we're seeing in this data also speak to the actions of individuals taken across the country to protect themselves against the virus that includes changing their behaviors and seeking out testing and vaccines,\" Daskalakis said. The U.S. is still battling the largest monkeypox outbreak in the world with nearly 21,000 cases reported across all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Monkeypox is primarily spreading during sex among gay and bisexual men, though anyone can catch the virus through close physical contact with someone who is infected or contaminated materials such as towels and bedsheets. The disease is rarely fatal, but causes painful lesions resembling pimples or blisters. The Biden administration faced criticism over the summer for not moving quickly enough to ramp up vaccine supply to meet the tremendous demand for the shots. Health Secretary Xavier Becerra declared a public health emergency last month, and the Food and Drug Administration authorized a different method to administer the vaccines that allows providers to extract more doses from each vaccine vial. The Jynneos vaccine, manufactured by Danish biotech company Bavarian Nordic, is the only approved monkeypox vaccine in the U.S. It is administered in two doses 28 days apart, with the peak immune response coming two weeks after the second dose. The CDC does not yet have real-world efficacy data on the Jynneos vaccine, though public health officials expect it to provide protection against monkeypox. Vaccine supply has expanded significantly since early August. The U.S. has administered more than 460,000 monkeypox vaccines doses so far, according to data from 35 states provided to the CDC. About 1.6 million gay and bisexual men face the highest risk from monkeypox and have been the primary focus of vaccination efforts. The Black and Hispanic communities are particularly hard hit by the virus. Nearly 38% of patients are Black, 29% are Hispanic, and 27% are White, according to CDC data. The overall U.S. population is 12% Black, 19% Hispanic, and 61% White, according to data from the 2020 Census. Daskalakis said the CDC and the White House have been working with organizations in Black and Brown communities to improve vaccine access. Vaccinations were offered on site at Atlanta Black Pride over the Labor Day weekend with 4,000 doses administered, according to Robert Fenton, head of the White House monkeypox response team. The U.S. is offering vaccinations on site at Pride and other events with high attendance by gay and bisexual men to make the shots more available. More than 3,000 doses were administered at Southern Decadence in New Orleans, according to Fenton. The U.S. is providing 820 doses to Boise Pride and 10,000 doses for California ahead of the Folsom Street Fair and the Castro Street Fair, Fenton said. Daskalakis said federal health officials are also working with colleges and universities as school gets back into session to inform them about the resources and tools available to address monkeypox in the event that there are infections on campus, though the risk is low. \"The risk in colleges is extremely low,\" Daskalakis said. \"Realistically, given the way that this virus is spreading through the population, the risk in those settings is low. Awareness is more important than anxiety,\" he said. People who have monkeypox should stay at home until the rash has healed and a new layer of skin has formed, stay away from other people, and do not share any objects or materials with other people, according to CDC guidance. People who have a new or unexplained rash should avoid sex and social gatherings, particularly those where there's close skin-to-skin contact, according to CDC. People can also reduce their risk of infection by temporarily limiting sexual partners until two weeks after receiving the second dose of the monkeypox vaccine."},

But booking airfare on a certain day of the week isn't one of them, according to data from Google Flights. Booking mid-week \u2014 and especially Tuesdays around midnight \u2014 is often cited as the best time to purchase flights. But in the past five years, U.S. airfares purchased on Tuesdays, Wednesday or Thursdays have been only 1.9% cheaper on average than airfares purchased during the weekend, according to Google Flights. \"If your trip is just a couple of weeks away, don't wait for Tuesday to roll around \u2014 book your flight now in case the price goes up,\" wrote James Byers, Google Flights' group product manager, on a blog post published yesterday. While the day of the week travelers book may not matter much, the day they fly does, according to Google Flights' research, which examined five years of historical flight data from Aug. 1, 2017 to Aug. 1, 2022. \"On average, flights that depart on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday have been 12% cheaper than weekend departures,\" wrote Byers. \"If you exclude international destinations, the potential savings jump even higher to 20%.\" Another common strategy \u2014 booking early \u2014 also works, according to the data. For U.S. domestic flights, airfares have been lowest between three and eight weeks before a departure date, with prices \"bottoming out\" 44 days out, according to the research. Non-stop flights cost on average about 20% more than connecting flights, according to Google Flights, but flights with stops also increase the risk of interruptions. An Instagram poll by the travel insurance company World Nomads indicated more than 1 in 3 respondents spent up to $250 on flights, meals or hotels because of flight delays or cancellations this summer, while 12% reported spending between $500 to $1,000. Travelers with flexible flying days can use Google Flights' \"date grid\" function to quickly ascertain the cheapest dates to depart and arrive in a given week. Those who want to travel for a specific duration \u2014 say, two weeks \u2014 but are flexible on when, can use the \"price graph\" function to see the cheapest times to fly too. Price tracking also eliminates the need to search again and again to price-check a desired route. Search the route once, hit the button to \"track prices\" and Google Flights will send notifications of airfare changes via email. Based on its historical data, Google Flights also suggests the \"best times\" to book flights for peak-period travel and popular routes. Travelers hoping to save money on airfare to Europe are advised to plan the earliest, while summer vacationers can consider making plans weeks, rather than months, in advance."},

Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina is set to start operations in 2025, with the firm stating that total investment in the plant will now amount to $3.8 billion. Norm Bafunno, who is senior vice president, unit manufacturing and engineering at Toyota Motor North America, said the announcement marked \"another significant milestone\" for the business. The additional investment in the U.S. is part of a wider investment of up to $5.6 billion in battery production, with Toyota noting that demand for battery electric vehicles was growing. To this end, the business said it would aim to ramp up \"combined battery production capacity\" in the U.S. and Japan by as much as 40 gigawatt hours. As well as diesel and gasoline vehicles, Toyota is known for its hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell offerings. It is also attempting to make headway in the increasingly competitive battery-electric market, where firms like Tesla and Volkswagen are jostling for position. This has not been without its challenges. In June 2022, Toyota issued a safety recall for more than 2,000 of its all-electric SUV, the bZ4X. Toyota may be looking to invest billions in EV battery production, but on Wednesday the business stressed it would also \"continue to make every effort to flexibly meet the needs\" of customers \"in all countries and regions by offering multiple powertrains and providing as many options as possible.\" Indeed, the website of Toyota Europe states that the \"internal combustion engine continues to be the most popular means of powering vehicles and it will continue to play a role for the next 20 to 30 years.\" All the above comes at a time when major economies are laying out plans to reduce the environmental footprint of road-based transportation. Just this month, the California Air Resources Board approved a rule that will require all new car sales in the state to be zero emission by the year 2035. Elsewhere, the U.K. wants to stop the sale of new diesel and gasoline cars and vans by 2030. It will require, from 2035, all new cars and vans to have zero-tailpipe emissions. The European Union \u2014 which the U.K. left on Jan. 31, 2020 \u2014 is pursuing similar targets. According to the International Energy Agency, electric vehicle sales hit 6.6 million in 2021. In the first quarter of 2022, EV sales came to 2 million, a 75% increase compared to the first three months of 2021."},

Situated roughly 89 kilometers (approximately 55 miles) off the coast of Yorkshire, England, the scale of Hornsea 2 is considerable. According to Orsted, it has a capacity of more than 1.3 gigawatts and stretches across an area of 462 square kilometers \u2014 more than half the size of New York City. Hornsea 2, it added, uses Siemens Gamesa turbines with blades measuring 81 meters, or more than 265 feet. \"One revolution of the wind turbine blades can power an average UK home for 24 hours,\" the company says. It is the latest step forward for the Hornsea 2 project, which generated its first power in Dec. 2021. The development comes as European countries attempt to wean themselves off Russian fossil fuels, including gas, following the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine in February. \"Current global events highlight more than ever the importance of landmark renewable energy projects like Hornsea 2, helping the UK increase the security and resilience of its energy supply and drive down costs for consumers by reducing dependence on expensive fossil fuels,\" said Duncan Clark, head of the U.K. region at Orsted. The U.K. is home to a mature offshore wind sector that looks set to expand in the coming years, with authorities aiming for up to 50 GW of capacity by 2030. The European Union, which the U.K. left in January 2020, has previously laid out a 300 GW target for offshore wind by the middle of this century. Across the Atlantic, the U.S. has a long way to go to catch up with Europe. America's first offshore wind facility, the 30 megawatt Block Island Wind Farm, only started commercial operations in late 2016.

The research, based on an analysis of the online ad budgets of over 100 different consumer app companies, found that Apple's ad business has benefited from the company's major iOS privacy update in 2021, which made it more difficult for companies like Facebook to track users across the Internet. Apple's search ads let people advertise on the iPhone maker's App Store. Advertiser adoption rate for the second quarter rose almost 4 percentage points from a year earlier to 94.8%, while Facebook adoption fell 3 percentage points to 82.8%, Appsumer said. Google's rate declined 2 points to 94.8%. Apple has \"joined the duopoly of Facebook and Google at the top table of advertiser adoption,\" according to Appsumer, which is owned by InMobi. Shumel Lais, general manager at Appsumer, attributed Apple's improved standing to an increase in the number of app developers willing to pay big money to bolster downloads. At the same time, Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) update has limited the amount of data ad-based apps like Facebook can use to help brands with their online ad campaigns. \"One of the things that's quite interesting is the ATT measurement limitations that are kind of put on the wider network doesn't exist in the same way for Apple,\" Lais said. \"So you could say Apple has slightly more visibility or an advantage across the other channels on iOS.\" Apple's rise in online ads for developers mirrors Amazon's position in e-commerce, as retailers spend more money to promote their products on the site they rely on for customers. In terms of overall app developer spend on online advertising, referred to as share of wallet, Google remains at the top, with 34%. Facebook is second at 28%, followed by Apple at 15%. Amazon wasn't listed because it's not a platform for developers. At the lower end of the market, TikTok overtook Snap, which has also been hammered by ATT. TikTok has 3% market share, and Snap is at 2%, Appsumer said. Even though it topped Snap, TikTok's adoption rate dropped nearly 7 percentage points in the second quarter. Lais said app developers are still trying to figure out what ads work well on the short video service. \"Brands are maybe still adjusting to making TikTok work for every vertical,\" Lais said. The numbers weren't all bad for Facebook. Its share of wallet rose 4 points to 28% in the fourth quarter, indicating the social media company is experiencing some \"signs of recovery,\" Lais said. In July, Facebook parent Meta reported a stepper-than-expected drop in second-quarter revenue and said sales will drop again from the year-ago period in the third quarter. Lais said Facebook benefits from the serendipity of ads, versus Google and Apple, which serve ads based on search terms. \"Facebook still has very unique properties and people are in a mindset where they are in kind of a discovery mode, so there's still opportunity there,\" Lais said.

{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/29/apple-iphone-14-event-preview-september-2022.html", "title": "Apple's big iPhone 14 event kicks off Wednesday. Here's what to expect", "paragraphs": " Apple is holding a launch event at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, on Wednesday where it will unveil its latest hardware products, including the new iPhone 14. Apple has used prerecorded videos for its launch events since early 2020 thanks partly to Covid restrictions, and this will be the first iPhone launch with an in-person component since 2019. Apple is streaming the launch event online on its website and YouTube in addition to inviting some media to its campus. Apple's hype-filled fall launches are a signature event for Apple. They typically draw millions of simultaneous viewers on YouTube. They garner attention from around the world and set the stage for a holiday marketing blitz during the last three months of the year, which is when Apple's sales are the highest. This year's event has the tagline \"far out,\" which could refer to features such as night-sky photography. Last year, Apple released new iPhones and Apple Watches at an event in September, and then followed it up with an October launch featuring iPads and Macs. Here's what Apple is likely to launch Wednesday, based on reports. Apple is expected to release four new iPhone models. If Apple's current naming convention holds up, they will be called the iPhone 14. This year Apple will likely discontinue the \"mini\" model with a 4.7-inch screen, according to reports. Instead, Apple could offer two sizes, one with a 6.1-inch screen and one with a 6.7-inch screen, each coming in a standard model and a pricier \"Pro\" model. The Pro models are expected to get more upgrades, according to reports from Bloomberg News, TFI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, and other analysts and Apple watchers. Since 2017, iPhones have included a space at the top of the phone's display with space for Apple's FaceID system, which includes several sensors and a camera. The Pro models could ditch Apple's \"notch\" where it houses the FaceID camera for a slimmer, more streamlined \"pill\" or \"cutout\" approach with a smaller space that has to remain blank, leaving room for an even larger display. The Pro models are also expected to get upgraded A16 processors and cameras. The camera bump is expected to get larger. Apple could release an always-on screen display for showing notifications, like some Android phones have sported for years. Beta iPhone software released over the summer suggested that Apple may be planning a similar feature because of new widgets that show weather and battery life. One of the biggest questions is how Apple will price its iPhones in a period of inflation around the world and macroeconomic uncertainty in some regions. Other consumer electronics, such as Sony's Playstation 5, have seen price cuts. Apple's least-expensive iPhone 13 model is the $699 iPhone 13 Mini, which is expected to be discontinued. That would make Apple's mainline device, which is currently the iPhone 13, the least-expensive new model at $829, if its price doesn't change. Some analysts also expect Apple to increase the price of its Pro models. Apple usually drops the price of older models when it releases new ones, giving more price-sensitive consumers an option. Apple is likely to show the eighth major new version of its watch on Wednesday. Last year, the Apple Watch Series 7 got a slightly larger screen, but the redesign did not significantly change the look and feel of the device, which has remained mostly the same since 2014. Expect more evolution this year, too. Apple is considering a body temperature sensor in the new devices, according to the Wall Street Journal, which could help with fertility and sleep tracking. Other sleep tracking features could include the ability to detect advanced sleep patterns or apnea. But the biggest Apple Watch Series 8 announcement could be a new \"Pro\" model with a bigger screen and more durable finish. Apple has previously released Apple Watches with pricey case materials such as gold, ceramic and titanium, and the new \"Pro\" model described by Bloomberg and Kuo could be one of the first high-end Apple Watches to gain additional features over its less-expensive siblings. Also likely: A new updated version of the Apple Watch SE, its $329 entry-level Watch model. IPhone owners who don't plan to buy any new gear this fall will still get an annual update to the iPhones software, iOS 16, which was announced in June and has been in testing over the summer. The software has several new features that users will immediately notice. The biggest banner feature is the ability to customize the iPhone's lock screen with widgets that can display weather forecasts, calendar appointments and other information at a glance. Users can also change the font for the lock screen clock for the first time, as well. IOS 16 also lets you unsend or edit iMessage text messages, as long as you catch them within a few minutes of sending. IOS 16 will also introduce short-term loans from Apple called Apple Pay Later. The feature will allow users to buy stuff online with Apple Pay but pay for the item in four installments without paying interest. One cool feature in iOS 16 is if a user has both an iPhone and a Mac laptop or desktop, they can use the iPhone as a very high-definition web camera. Apple is unlikely to release new iPads on Wednesday because their software isn't ready yet. Earlier this month, Apple told TechCrunch that iPadOS, the iPad software, will ship after iOS this fall, suggesting a staggered release. Apple's statement was terse, and the company dislikes talking about unannounced products. But in general, it likes to release new hardware together with new software, so the statement clearly suggested that new iPads would come at a later launch date than iPhones. IPadOS and iOS are very similar, but this year iPadOS is getting a feature called Stage Manager that could allow users to multitask more efficiently \u2014 but also got panned by early testers. Improved iPads could include more powerful processors that are closers to laptop processors, smoother displays and better integration with accessories. Apple also uncharacteristically teased a new \"Mac Pro\" in the spring. The Mac Pro is currently a $5,000 tower of power using an Intel processor. Apple wants to transition its entire Mac lineup away from Intel to its own M-series processors, but a pricey niche product doesn't fit as well with Apple's mass-market iPhones and Apple Watches. Instead, new Macs could be announced at a separate event later this year, as happened last year."},

During a phone in with radio station LBC back in April, and prior to his position in new Prime Minister Liz Truss' cabinet, Rees-Mogg offered some insight into how he may look to shape policy in the months ahead. \"We need to be thinking about extracting every last cubic inch of gas from the North Sea because we want security of supply,\" he said. \"But 2050 is a long time off,\" he added, referring to the U.K.'s legally binding goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by the middle of this century. \"We're not trying to become net-zero tomorrow, and we are going to need fossil fuels in the interim, and we should use ours, that we have got available,\" Rees-Mogg said. He later doubled down on the need for fossil fuels, stating that \"we want to get oil out of the North Sea, we want to get more gas out of the North Sea.\" And on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, Rees-Mogg said, \"if we're sitting on tons of gas, that seems quite an interesting opportunity.\" Such a viewpoint stands in stark contrast to the views expressed by high-profile figures such as the U.N. Secretary General, Antonio Guterres. Back in June, Guterres slammed new funding for fossil fuel exploration, describing it as \"delusional\" and calling for an abandonment of fossil fuel finance. In his phone in with LBC, Rees-Mogg said he was \"very much in favor of going nuclear\" and \"very interested by \u2026 modular nuclear reactors.\" Offshore wind, he said, was \"providing an increasing part of our supply, and that is important, but you don't always know where the wind is going to blow, that is the problem, whereas nuclear provides baseload.\" Rees-Mogg has also appeared skeptical about the importance of acting now when it comes to rolling out renewables and tackling climate change. Speaking to ChatPolitics in 2014, for instance, he said he \"would like my constituents to have cheap energy rather more than I would like them to have windmills.\" Asked about the climate and global warming, he offered up the following take. \"I'm all in favor of long-term policy making, but I think trying to forecast the climate for a thousand years and what little steps you make now having the ability to change it is unrealistic, and I think the cost of it is probably unaffordable. You need to look at ameliorating the consequences of anything that may happen.\" Rees-Mogg's views have already prompted a barrage of criticism from environmental organizations. Dave Timms, head of political affairs at Friends of the Earth, said putting Rees-Mogg in charge of energy policy was \"deeply worrying for anyone concerned about the deepening climate emergency, solving the cost-of-living crisis and keeping our fuel bills down for good.\" Elsewhere, Greenpeace UK's head of politics, Rebecca Newsom, described Rees-Mogg as being \"the last person who should be in charge of the energy brief, at the worst possible moment.\" CNBC contacted the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy for comment, but did not receive a response ahead of this story's publication. Rees-Mogg is part of the cabinet assembled by the U.K.'s new Prime Minister, Liz Truss. Truss is assuming office at a time of significant turmoil and uncertainty in energy markets, with many European countries attempting to wean themselves off Russian fossil fuels following the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. During an interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg over the weekend, Truss provided an insight into her views on the matter. \"We, actually, as a country, rely relatively little on gas from Russia,\" she said, noting that this was not the case in Europe. It was important, she went on to argue, \"that we develop renewables, we develop nuclear, that we work with our European partners to develop alternative forms of energy.\" \"It's also very important we use the resources in the North Sea,\" Truss, who was speaking before her victory in the Conservative Party's leadership contest was announced, said. \"There's more we can do to exploit current gas fields. I support exploring fracking in parts of the United Kingdom, where that can be done.\""},

Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said in a Tuesday note that Apple will likely raise prices on its iPhone 14 Pro models by $100 over last year's iPhone 13 Pro. That sentiment was echoed in notes from JPMorgan and Credit Suisse. Apple's iPhone 13 Pro starts at $999 while the iPhone 13 Pro Max, which has a bigger screen, starts at $1,099. Sacconaghi said Apple is likely to retire the $699 iPhone 13 mini and replace it with a more expensive and larger iPhone 14 Max, which he said will cost about $899. The iPhone 14 Max may help Apple increase the average selling price of its iPhones by offering the much-larger screen that has otherwise been reserved for the more expensive iPhone Pro Max models. Apple is also expected to sell a standard iPhone 14 with the same size screen as the iPhone 13. Credit Suisse analysts said they'll be watching whether price increases impact demand in countries where the U.S. dollar has strengthened. \"While we think there will be some pressure, we believe the proliferation of installment plans will significantly lessen the impact as customers will only need to pay the equivalent of a few more dollars per month per device,\" Credit Suisse analysts said. Analysts at JPMorgan anticipate a price increase for iPhone 14 Pro models because of inflation and supply chain pressures, but they don't expect Apple to raise prices for the regular iPhone 14. The analysts said a price bump would matter more for the company's wearables like the Apple Watch. \"Pricing is a key watch-point in a tough macro which comprises inflationary pressures and pull back in consumer spending, but we believe it matters more for Wearables which are considered more discretionary purchases relative to iPhone by consumers,\" they wrote in a Tuesday note. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report."},
{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/09/apple-event-had-an-unusually-dark-tone-emphasizing-emergency-features.html", "title": "Apple event this year had an unusually dark undertone as it leaned into emergency features for a dangerous world", "paragraphs": " When Apple held its annual launch event for the iPhone 13 in 2021, it started with a joyful video featuring jazz dancers celebrating the natural beauty of California (which can be captured with an iPhone camera, of course). The undertone of Apple's iPhone 14 launch this week was darker. After zooming in on Apple's headquarters from space, it kicked off with a video highlighting users who wrote letters to Apple CEO Tim Cook saying that they almost died \u2014 but were saved by their Apple Watch calling 911. \"Dear Apple: My dad was flying our small plane to Vermont. I was asleep in the back seat. I woke up when we were crashing into the tops of the trees. The plane broke into six pieces and we were miles away from civilization in the freezing cold. Then, all of a sudden, my Apple Watch started ringing,\" said one character named Hannah. Other characters in the short video told stories of falling into a frozen stream, getting trapped inside a trash compactor and witnessing a cardiac episode in a restaurant. Saving lives in emergency situations was the major theme of Apple's launch this year, and many of the most notable new features the company announced were oriented toward safety. The most significant new iPhone capability this year is called \" Emergency SOS via satellite,\" which can send a message for help even if there's no cell service around for miles. Users can also share their location with family or friends in the Find My app. Apple's example of how the feature works showed a hiker with a broken leg on top of a mountain ridge calling for a helicopter. Later, Apple mentioned winding back roads as another place where iPhone users might be out of range. But this feature could be useful in outside wilderness settings. Wildfires, hurricanes and other disasters can cut cell service, and having the ability to contact emergency services or tell your family where you are can literally be a lifesaver in those circumstances. Another example: Apple's $799 or more watch, the Ultra, has an 86-decibel siren that can be heard 600 feet away, and compass features that allow the user to retrace their steps without the internet. As with the satellite feature, Apple advertised it as a helpful tool for backcountry adventurers, but it could also be useful in more mundane settings. Imagine sounding the alarm as a deterrent to an attacker, or using the retracing feature to find your way back to your car after a disaster in your community has interrupted cell service. Apple also announced this week that iPhones and Apple Watches, using motion sensors, can now call 911 if they detect a car crash has occurred. \"We truly hope you never need it, but that you will feel a little bit safer every time you get in the car,\" an Apple presenter said, moments before showing images of a driver getting hit by an air bag in slow motion after crashing. Apple's launch events are designed to do one thing: build demand for Apple's new products. The company now wants to make the iPhone even more \"essential\" for its users through safety features, giving users reasons not to switch to competing Android devices. Will these features meaningfully increase iPhone adoption and sales? It turns out, Apple has at least considered the possibility in the past. In a disclosure with the ESG group CDP published in January 2019, Apple representatives wrote about potential business opportunities stemming from climate change, citing a previous version of the \"SOS\" feature as an example of Apple's work to build features for emergency situations. \"As severe weather events become more frequent, consumers may come to value more highly the immediate and ubiquitous availability of reliable mobile computing devices for use in situations where transportation, power and other services may be temporarily interrupted,\" Apple representatives wrote. Apple cited the 9/11 disaster and \"extreme weather events\" like hurricanes Katrina, Sandy, and Harvey that are occurring more frequently. \"Over time, as people begin to experience severe weather events with greater frequency, we expect an increasing need for confidence and preparedness in the arena of personal safety and the well-being of loved ones,\" Apple wrote in the disclosure. Apple's not the only consumer electronics company that is developing safety features for its devices. But Apple's devices also have a robust lineup of health features, like fall detection for seniors and heart monitoring, which underscore its overall safety pitch. \"iPhone is there when you need it most,\" one presenter said at the launch event. \"That confidence is especially important in moments where your safety is at risk.\" We may be seeing the start of a new messaging strategy at Apple: Its devices are the ones you want when things go wrong."},

It comes as the company seeks to remain relevant in the mobile market after U.S. sanctions crippled its mobile phone business. The Chinese technology giant took the wraps off the Mate 50 smartphone on Tuesday, alongside the MatePad Pro tablet and Watch GT 3 Pro smartwatch. Huawei's Mate 50 boasts an updated camera with 4 lenses arranged in a circle on the back. The phone also runs Harmony 3.0, the latest version of Huawei's self-developed operating system, which was first released in 2019 after the company was cut off from using Google's Android software due to U.S. sanctions. The Mate 50 also does not have connectivity to super-fast 5G networks after U.S. sanctions cut off the company from the key chip required for this. Instead, the phone connects to previous generation 4G networks. However, Huawei claims this is the first smartphone released to the public that can connect to China's Beidou satellite networking. Beidou was completed in 2020 and is a rival to the U.S. government-owned Global Positioning System (GPS), which is widely-used across the world. Connectivity to Beidou means users can still send messages even when they lose connection to a terrestrial mobile network, for example, if they're in a remote area. The Mate 50 went on pre-sale in China on Tuesday and the starting price is at 4,999 yuan ($718), with the higher-spec Mate 50 Pro starting at 6,799 yuan ($1,006). Huawei is trying to retain relevance in the smartphone market after U.S. sanctions, which cut the company off from key components and software and crushed its business. Huawei was once the number one smartphone player in the world, but now holds a very small share of the market. The company is hoping its other products such as the tablet, smartwatch and other accessories can pick up some of the slack. But Huawei, which rose to prominence through its telecommunications equipment business, has pivoted to new growth areas over the last two years, including software and cloud computing. More recently, Huawei has been building out an automotive technology business with a focus on electric vehicles. But the Shenzhen, south China-headquartered firm is not manufacturing cars. Instead, it is partnering with automakers and providing the technology in various parts of the vehicle. On Tuesday, Huawei launched the AITO M5 electric vehicle in collaboration with Chinese automaker Seres. The car contains Huawei's Harmony OS operating system for the digital cockpit and infotainment system and includes a computing system to adjust the torque of the vehicle. Huawei said it helps to improve the control of the vehicle. A number of Chinese technology firms, including search giant Baidu and smartphone maker Xiaomi, have entered the electric vehicle market to grab a slice of the pie in the fast-growing EV market. Huawei has already launched cars alongside Chinese state-owned automakers BAIC and Changan."},

In an announcement post on Facebook, Zuckerberg appears to be wearing a new headset, which is likely Project Cambria, a highly anticipated and powerful mixed-reality headset. The product and how it is received will be a key test of Zuckerberg's efforts to pivot the Facebook parent company to creating virtual reality and augmented reality hardware. Meta has spent as much as $10 billion a year on Zuckerberg's vision of creating the next major software platform, and the company has said one reason the technology hasn't taken off is that the hardware isn't good enough yet. The release timing of the product will give Meta an opportunity to gain a foothold in the market before Apple releases a competitive mixed reality headset of its own, reportedly as soon as next year. Zuckerberg said last month in an interview with podcaster Joe Rogan that the company planned to release Project Cambria in the fall. It's a hotly expected headset with the computing power to capture the real world with external cameras and display them inside the headset in real time and in color. The headset, which will likely cost $800 or more, will be significantly more expensive and capable than the current best-selling headset, the Meta Quest 2. Meta didn't announce a conference lineup on Tuesday, but the event is expected to last an entire day. It will be streamed online. In addition to revealing Project Cambria, Meta will also discuss updates to Horizon Worlds, its metaverse social networking app that has drawn mockery in recent weeks for its cartoonish graphics. The vice president in charge of Horizon is leaving the company, Meta confirmed in August. \"The graphics in Horizon are capable of much more \u2014 even on headsets \u2014 and Horizon is improving very quickly,\" Zuckerberg posted in August. In addition to Project Cambria, Meta is developing a slew of v arious virtual reality and augmented reality prototypes. The company believes the technology will eventually be used in a pair of lightweight glasses that can replace a user's smartphone."},

On Tuesday, the two companies announced that Tencent invested 300 million euros ($296.9 million) in Guillemot Brothers Limited, amounting to a 49.9% stake in the company. Tencent only gets 5% voting rights in the company. Guillemot Brothers Limited is controlled by the Guillemot family, and is the entity that controls the majority of the family's roughly 15% stake in Ubisoft. The Guillemot brothers founded Ubisoft in 1986 and have fought hard to keep the company independent and protected from a takeover. Tencent's investment values Ubisoft shares at 80 euros each, an 83% premium on Tuesday's closing price and gives it an indirect stake in the French games developer. The move effectively closes the door on a full takeover of Ubisoft by any party, according to analysts, something that investors were holding out for. \"What this transaction does appear to signal is that any full sale of Ubisoft to a strategic or financial buyer is very unlikely. In our view this should be seen as a net negative for shares (though not for the company itself),\" analysts at Cowen said in a note Tuesday. As part of the deal, Tencent is able to increase its direct stake in Ubisoft from 4.5% currently to 9.99% of the capital or voting rights. But Tencent will not be able to sell its shares for five years and will not be able to increase its stake in Ubisoft beyond 9.99% for a period of eight years. That effectively rules out a complete takeover of the gaming firm. Ubisoft's drama began in 2015 when French media conglomerate Vivendi took a stake in the European gaming firm, eventually becoming its biggest shareholder. But the Guillemot family were determined to keep the company independent. In 2018, after a three-year battle, Vivendi dropped its pursuit of Ubisoft. Tencent stepped in to buy some of the Ubisoft shares Vivendi offloaded and the Chinese tech giant ended up owning a 5% stake in the games company. Ubisoft has faced a number of challenges including sexual harassment allegations and a lack of new hit titles. Tencent's investment continues a flurry of deals in the video games space this year, particularly from Asian firms, that began with Microsoft's proposed $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard in January followed by Sony's takeover of Bungie, the maker of hit games Halo and Destiny. Tencent, based in Shenzhen, China, has grown into one of the world's largest gaming companies over the years, through acquisitions of and investments in smaller studios with popular global titles including League of Legends maker Riot Games, for example. Tougher regulation around gaming in China has pushed Tencent and its rival NetEase to expand overseas through investments and acquisitions. Ubisoft is known for some popular franchises including Assassin's Creed and Rainbow Six. Ubisoft scheduled an event for Saturday to reveal details about upcoming games. Tencent has typically helped companies it has invested in to run independently, but offered a hand to expand titles into China and onto mobile, where it has typically been strong. Martin Lau, president of Tencent, said that the two companies will continue \"to develop immersive game experiences\" and bring Ubisoft's most well-known franchises to mobile."},

Dr. Rita Singhal, director of disease control in Los Angeles County, said it's not clear what role monkeypox may have played in the person's death. Officials do not have additional details at this time, Singhal said. \"This is one of two deaths in the United States that are currently under investigation to determine whether monkeypox was a contributing cause of death,\" Singhal told reporters during a press conference Thursday. Health officials in Texas last month reported the death of an adult in the Houston area who was diagnosed with monkeypox. The individual had a severely compromised immune system, according to health officials. Monkeypox is rarely fatal, but people with weak immune systems are at higher risk of severe disease. The virus causes a painful rash that resembles blisters or pimples. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a report published Thursday, found that 38% of 2,000 patients diagnosed with monkeypox from May to July were HIV positive. People who have monkeypox and HIV were hospitalized more often than those who did not have HIV, according to the study. The U.S. is trying to contain the largest monkeypox outbreak in the world, with more than 21,000 cases across all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, according to the CDC. Nine monkeypox deaths have been confirmed worldwide since the outbreak began, according to CDC data. Deaths have occurred in Belgium, Brazil, Cuba, the Central African Republic, Ecuador, Ghana, India, Nigeria and Spain. More than 56,000 monkeypox cases have been reported across 96 countries since the outbreak began, according to CDC data. Monkeypox is primarily found to be spreading during sex among gay and bisexual men, though anyone can get monkeypox through close contact with someone who is infected or via contaminated materials like towels and bedsheets. Federal health officials said this week that the outbreak appears to be slowing as vaccines, testing and treatments have become more widely available. Demetre Daskalakis, deputy head of the White House monkeypox response team, said it took 25 days for cases to double in August compared to eight days in July. The U.S. has administered more than 460,000 monkeypox vaccine doses to date. About 1.6 million gay and bisexual men who have HIV or who are taking medication to reduce their risk of contracting HIV face the highest risk from monkeypox, according to CDC. The monkeypox vaccine, Jynneos, is administered in two doses 28 days apart. CDC officials say it's crucial for people at risk to receive the second shot. It takes two weeks after the second dose for the immune system to reach its peak response."},

The value of the entire cryptocurrency market also fell below $1 trillion as digital coins across the board saw a sell-off. Bitcoin found its way back above $19,000 late in the day and was last trading less than 1% higher at $19,044.30, according to Coin Metrics. Ether, which has far outpaced bitcoin's gains in recent months, hovered below the flat line, at $1,571.20. Central banks around the world are battling rampant inflation with tightening monetary policy. The U.S. Federal Reserve has undertaken a series of interest rate hikes totaling 2.25 percentage points. Markets are expecting further interest rate rises. Policy tightening by the Fed has strengthened the U.S. dollar which has weighed on risk assets. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has also surged. Bitcoin has traded in correlation to stocks and so if they fall, in general, so does the cryptocurrency. \"The macro environment also continues to prove difficult with the dollar continuing to put in highs. This impacts all risk assets as we can see,\" Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, told CNBC. \"If we see the dollar start to move back down, then we should be able to get risk assets such as bitcoin move back up again.\" The crypto market has been battered this year with nearly $2 trillion wiped off its value since its peak in November. Bitcoin is about 60% off its record high of $68,990.90 that was hit in November. The sell-off has been caused by a tough environment for risk assets as well as crypto-specific issues including collapsed projects and bankruptcies that has spread across the industry. Bitcoin has been trading within a tight range of between $18,000 to $24,000 since June. Luno's Ayyar said that in forming a bottom, \"bitcoin typically likes to go back and test previous lows to see if they hold as support.\" He said that unless bitcoin falls below $17,500, then the market is likely consolidating within the $18,000 to $24,000 range. In the meantime, ether and so-called altcoins, or alternative coins, have managed to rise further than bitcoin. Ether has outpaced bitcoin since both cryptocurrencies hit a low in June. Ether is the native cryptocurrency on the Ethereum network. Ethereum is planning a huge upgrade this month \u2014 known as the merge \u2014 that proponents say will make the network more efficient, and draw in new investors and drive bigger yields. \"Ethereum hit yearly highs against the bitcoin pair in anticipation of the merge,\" Ayyar said. \" Hence there has been a lot more interest and activity in the Altcoin space, while Bitcoin consolidates.\""},

But the billionaire Tesla CEO will be allowed to add claims from a Twitter whistleblower to his countersuit, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick ruled. The trial is expected to begin Oct. 17, earlier than the mid-November date Musk's team requested in its latest push. \"I previously rejected Defendants' arguments in response to Twitter's motion to expedite, making clear that the longer the delay until trial, the greater the risk of irreparable harm to Twitter,\" McCormick wrote. \"I am convinced that even four weeks' delay would risk further harm to Twitter too great to justify.\" Still, McCormick said Musk's request to amend his counterclaim clears the relatively \"low bar\" of the court's rules for doing so. Musk's lawyers asked to add claims related to the whistleblower complaint recently made public by Twitter's former head of security, Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko. Musk's team argued the complaint, which detailed what Zatko alleged were egregious security failings by the company, would show Twitter breached its terms of the merger agreement if true. Shortly after Zatko's allegations became public, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal said in a memo to employees first reported by CNN that while they were still reviewing the complaint, it \"is a false narrative that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies, and presented without important context.\" Musk originally said he wants to exit the deal because he's received insufficient reassurance from Twitter about the percentage of its monetizable users that are actually spam accounts. McCormick said Musk's team would be entitled to only \"incremental discovery\" based on the new allegations, including \"targeted document discovery and minimal additional experts and fact witnesses.\" \"We are hopeful that winning the motion to amend takes us one step closer to the truth coming out in that courtroom,\" Musk lawyer Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel said in a statement. \"We look forward to presenting our case in Court beginning on October 17th and intend to close the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk,\" a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement.

But, there are some noteworthy changes. Unsurprisingly, the cameras are even better \u2014 Apple highlights camera improvements every year \u2014 and include a 48-megapixel sensor for even sharper photos and to let in more light. The big changes are on the screen and inside. There's new satellite connectivity, for example, which allows you to point the phone toward a satellite to send a message or call emergency services where you don't have cellular service. The Pro also boasts an always-on display that lets you quickly peek at notifications, see what music is playing, track a flight, and more, without having to wake your screen up every time. You can just leave your phone on your desk and glance over whenever you want to see what's going on. It's similar to a feature that's been on Android phones for years. There's also a new pill-shaped cutout that replaces the blank \"notch\" that had previously housed the camera and Face ID sensor. The camera and sensor are still there, just hidden. It can show you notifications or status updates, and even the album art of the song you're playing. Here's a peek: It's super small in person, so here's a better look at what Apple showed during the event: You can tap that pill to view the song you're playing, or more information about a notification that's in the space. Apple calls the feature \"Dynamic Island\" and says it will work with alarms, AirDrop, flight alerts, AirPod pairing and charging indications, notifications about the status of your Lyft ride and more.

The company disclosed during Apple 's annual fall hardware launch event that it would be operating a satellite-powered emergency SOS service for the forthcoming iPhone 14. The stock closed down 1% but was up about 2% after hours. The stock quickly gave up most of those gains and is currently trading up about 5% for the day, after being down more than 10% prior to the announcement. Nonetheless, the stock move shows how exposure to a large technology company such as Apple can have a significant impact on a smaller entity's operations. In early 2020, Globalstar said it had agreed to provide services for a \"potential customer\" that it did not name. On Wednesday Globalstar revealed in a regulatory filing that customer is Apple. A copy of the agreement shows that Apple can elect to receive warrants to buy up to 2.64% of Globalstar's outstanding stock at $1.01 per share. But Apple isn't obligated to receive the warrants. Globalstar now sees 2023 revenue between $185 million and $230 million, depending partly on the degree to which it achieves goals tied to its Apple deal. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had previously expected $130.6 million in 2023 revenue from the company. \"The Company expects these financial metrics to continue to improve significantly by 2026, which is expected to be the first full year in which the new satellites are operational, with total revenue expected to increase by approximately 35% compared to the 2023 forecast driven primarily by revenue growth under the Partnership Agreements,\" Globalstar said. Apple agreed to pay Globalstar for 95% of approval capital spending tied to the new satellites and other costs, according to Wednesday's filing. Globalstar said that as part of the agreement, it must raise more debt capital to to launch the new satellites. A satellite connection for iPhones had been expected at least since 2021. Analysts at B Riley, who have a buy rating on Globalstar stock, said in a note last month that they suspected the potential mystery customer was Apple. Apple said on Wednesday that a compatible iPhone's antennas will be able to connect to a satellite and communicate in places where there's no regular cellular connectivity, and that a phone will compress a message to accelerate delivery to a ground station, which can then pass the message to emergency responders. Globalstar's infrastructure launched in the late 1990s through a partnership with Loral Space and Communications and Qualcomm. The Louisiana-based company filed for bankruptcy and received backing from privately held investment firm Thermo before a 2006 initial public offering.

Apple designed the Ultra to be more rugged so it can withstand the elements better if you take it to the mountains or deep under water. There's a larger crown, too, so it's easier to use while you're wearing gloves if you're diving or in the snow. And it has a bigger screen. But it sure is chunky. Just look at it on my wrist: The screen has other cool features. It's twice as bright as before, so it's even easier to see outside.

It's orange, which definitely stands out, but can be customized to launch an app when you tap it. So, you can start a workout, mark a specific waypoint on a hike, launch your music app and more, just by tapping it. It's thicker than other Apple Watches, but includes some new functions like a depth gauge for real-time measurements under water. It also has up to 36 hours of battery life in normal use, or up to 60 hours on low-power settings.

One thing stood out, though: it put a new focus on safety features. Here's an overview of what's new. Emergency SOS is a new safety service that operates via satellite for iPhone 14 users. It will allow you to connect with emergency services even if you are outside of Wi-Fi or cell service range. It may be useful for folks who are stuck out on a hike, for example. Apple created a user experience that shows you where to point your phone to stay connected to a satellite as it moves. You can answer questions about the emergency through the interface, send text messages or connect to an emergency service through a relay center. Apple said it's free for two years but didn't say how much it will cost after that. Apple also announced a new Crash Detection feature for iPhone 14 and new Apple Watch Series 8, Apple Watch SE and Apple Watch Ultra users. It builds on Apple's fall detection that was already available in Apple Watch models. It's a feature we've seen before in other devices, like some of Google's Pixel phones, but it's the first time we've seen it in Apple's products. Crash Detection can identify front impact, side impact, rear-end and roll-over collisions in most popular types of vehicles, and the feature only runs when you are driving. In the case of an emergency, Crash Detection will auto connect you with emergency services, provide your location and notify your emergency contacts. Sporty Apple Watch Ultra users will have access to a range of safety features designed for extreme conditions. Apple redesigned the Compass app so you can retrace your steps and mark your location, for example, and recreational scuba divers can download the Oceanic+ app for access to safety warnings that they would otherwise expect on advanced dive computers. As the image above shows, it can alert you to a decompression safety stop while you're diving. The Apple Watch Ultra also has a new 86-decibel siren that can be heard up to 600 feet away, in case you're lost or stuck out in the elements and need people nearby to find you."},

But the biggest surprise from Apple is something that didn't happen: a price increase. Despite surging inflation around the world and supply chain challenges that have made it more challenging to procure parts, Apple said the entry-level iPhone 14 will start at $799, the same amount that it initially charged for last year's iPhone 13. The successor to the iPhone 13 Pro, the iPhone 14 Pro, remains at $999. Apple's highest-end iPhone, the Pro Max, still starts at $1099 for the new version. Analysts had been expecting some price hikes in Apple's lineup. In holding steady, Apple didn't want to further dent demand with the risks of a deteriorating economy already threatening to crimp consumer spending. IDC expects global smartphone shipments to decline over 6% this year, although mostly in the lower-end categories where Apple doesn't compete. Apple shares rose about 1.4% on Wednesday to $156.61. Apple did make one tweak to the lineup that could increase the average selling price of an iPhone. The company eliminated the iPhone 13 Mini, which was the least-expensive model, at $699. It's been replaced by the iPhone 13 Plus, a bigger model with a 6.7-inch screen and an $899 price tag. Apple also introduced a pricey new Apple Watch, the Ultra, with a bigger screen and more rugged titanium case, which starts at $799. But even that device is less expensive than Apple's Edition models, which cost as much as $10,000 when introduced in 2014, and is in line with more recent editions with titanium cases that started at $799. The other new Apple Watch models, the Series 8, are consistent with previous prices. Apple raised the entry-level price for a new Apple Watch by eliminating the Series 3, an older model that was retailing for $199. The least-expensive new Apple Watch is now the SE, which starts at $249, or $30 less than the older SE version. Apple also introduced a new version of its AirPods Pro wireless earbuds at $249, which is unchanged from the previous model. While U.S. prices were largely flat, Apple sets prices in each country and they can sometimes differ from the American price converted into a foreign currency. The U.S. dollar is strong right now, and some devices are more expensive overseas. For example, Apple's new Ultra watch starts at $1,099 in Canada.

In October, Jassy said Amazon would leave it up to individual managers to decide how often workers would be required to come into the office, which marked a sharp reversal from its earlier goal of returning to an \"office-centric culture.\" Jassy said Wednesday most employees have returned to physical offices and are spending some days working from home. Certain teams tend to be at the office more often, such as hardware or creative units, while others, such as engineers, continue to work largely remotely, he added. \"I do think there are some things that are harder to do remotely,\" Jassy said. \"I think it's a little harder to invent remotely.\" Jassy has previously said the Covid-19 pandemic could leave a lasting impact on how offices are used, noting that it has already affected how Amazon hires employees. For example, Amazon is now more open to remote work, and will recruit employees from any location, rather than just focusing on areas where it has \"critical mass,\" he said. Amazon's position on remote work differs from some of its tech peers. Google began requiring most employees to return to physical offices at least three days a week in April, which has generated some pushback among workers who oppose the mandate.

The six plaintiffs include Coinbase employees and other users of the mixing service that was blacklisted by the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in August. Mixing services like Tornado Cash are used to obfuscate crypto transactions, which while anonymous, are easily traceable. The Treasury Department argued this particular service was used to launder more than $7 billion worth of digital currency in the past three years by North Korean hackers and other bad actors. But in some cases, mixing services are used for legitimate privacy reasons. One plaintiff, a senior security risk analyst at Coinbase, used the service to anonymize donations to Ukraine out of fear his address would be targeted by Russian hacking groups. Another had concerns about his family's security. \"Each is an American who simply wants to engage in entirely lawful activity in private,\" according to the lawsuit. The sanctions were a unique move by Treasury to blacklist open source software, versus an entity or person. Crypto enthusiasts have argued that the move was an overstep, sets a new legal precedent and could cause negative ripple effects for the tech industry. \"We saw this as a much larger problem,\" Coinbase's chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, told CNBC. \"It sets a dangerous precedent -- if this code can be designated without any limits imposed by law, any technology any tool or system could be fair game.\" Grewal, former deputy general counsel at Facebook, said it could have a chilling effect on innovation. He likened the Tornado Cash scenario to police chasing armed robbers on a highway. In order to catch the criminals, \"we wouldn't ban all use of that highway.\" Grewal said it was the first time Coinbase has financially supported an external lawsuit and plans to pay for the plaintiffs' lawyers, as well as other costs associated with pursuing the claims in federal court. Thursday's suit argues that the move went a step beyond Treasury's authority, and as Coinbase put it in a blog post uses \"a hammer instead of a scalpel.\" The plaintiffs argue it caused financial harm as their money is still locked on Tornado Cash, and hurt users relying on the tools for privacy reasons. The case asks the Court to remove Tornado Cash smart contracts from the U.S. sanctions list. Coinbase is the largest U.S. crypto exchange by trading volume and has publicly advocated for crypto reforms in Washington, while dealing with a series of recent SEC probes. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently requested information from Coinbase about the listing of cryptocurrencies that the agency argues may have been unregistered securities. The SEC is also looking into its crypto rewards program, known as staking. \"We have advocated for regulatory reform across Washington and that work will continue,\" Grewal said. \"We can continue to cooperate and partner with the agencies that are being challenged in this instance, because this is not about questioning anyone's good faith, but it is about assuring that the rule of law applies.\""},

Speaking at Code Conference in Los Angeles, Pichai gave more details about how he\u2019s thinking of making the company run more efficiently ahead of economic uncertainty and a broader slowdown in ad spending, of which Google has been the largest beneficiary to date. \u201cThe more we try to understand the macroeconomic, we feel very uncertain about it,\u201d Pichai said on stage Tuesday. \u201cThe macroeconomic performance is correlated to ad spend, consumer spend and so on,\" he added. While he said he views macroeconomic factors as outside of his control, Pichai acknowledged the company has become \"slower\" after its headcount ballooned. \"We want to make sure as a company, when you have fewer resources than before, you are prioritizing all the right things to be working on and your employees are really productive that they can actually have impact on the things they\u2019re working on so that's what we are spending our time on.\" Host Kara Swisher asked the CEO how he planned to make the company more efficient, citing \u201cSimplicity Sprint,\u201d a recent internal project launched to re-focus the growing company and \u201cget better results faster\u201d as first reported by CNBC in July. While revenue is still growing, the effort came after the company reported its second consecutive quarter of weaker-than-expected earnings and revenue. However, prior to that, employees early in the year had given the company's leadership particularly poor marks on pay, promotions and execution, citing the company\u2019s growing bureaucracy, which executives acknowledged at the time. \u201cAcross everything we do, we can be slower to make decisions,\u201d Pichai said Tuesday. \"You look at it end-to-end and figure out how to make the company 20% more productive.\u201d Pichai also gave more specific examples of how he hopes to do that. He gave a past example of aligning YouTube Music and Google Play Music into one product. \u201cSometimes there are areas to make progress [where] you have three people making decisions, understanding that and bringing it down to two or one improves efficiency by 20%,\u201d he gave in another example.

With rampant inflation persisting and a global recession on the horizon, all eyes were on how Apple priced its main product during the Cupertino giant's big event on Wednesday, where it revealed four iPhone 14 models. One of the biggest surprises was that in the United States, Apple kept the prices of the iPhone 14 series the same as what it was charging for the equivalent iPhone 13 model. The iPhone 14 base model will start at $799, the same amount that it initially charged for last year's iPhone 13. The highest price iPhone 14 Pro Max starts at $1,099, the same as the iPhone 13 Pro Max. However, Apple has raised the price in some of its biggest markets globally. The latest Apple smartphones will be a test of global consumer appetite for new electronics and put U.S. tech giant's brand power on trial. Here are some comparisons of the iPhone 14 base model versus the iPhone 13 in various countries. U.K. Australia Japan Germany Other models have steeper price increases. For example, the iPhone 14 Pro Max in the U.K. is \u00a3150 more expensive than the equivalent last year's model. Analysts said part of the reason behind the rises could be increasing costs of components and the appreciation of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies in the markets where Apple has hiked prices. \"The key takeaway is the Euro and Yen has depreciated quite a bit translating to slightly higher prices,\" Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC. On Wednesday, the British pound fell to its lowest level against the dollar since 1985. The euro remains roughly at parity with the dollar and the greenback continues to appreciate against the Japanese yen. Apple kept the price of the iPhone the same in mainland China, one of its most important markets. Apple's greater China revenue segment, which includes the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan, was its third-biggest region by sales in the second quarter of the year. Apple's iPhone 14 is priced at 5,999 Chinese yuan ($862), with the Pro Max starting at 8,999 yuan. China has seen a resurgence of Covid this year. Authorities are sticking to their \"zero-Covid\" policy, which has led to lockdowns of major cities including the financial metropolis of Shanghai and production hub of Chengdu. That has hurt the economy and dampened consumer appetite. Market research firm IDC expects the Chinese smartphone market to contract by 13% this year, falling below 300 million device shipments for the first time since 2012. That could be one reason Apple has not changed its iPhone pricing in China. \"I won't be surprised if part of the rationale to keep prices flat there is to sustain demand in such a difficult environment, and in such a strategically important market for Apple at that,\" Bryan Ma, technology industry analyst at IDC, told CNBC. Apple continues to find success in China, particularly in the higher-priced premium segment of the market. Apple held a 70% market share in the $600-plus smartphone segment in China in the second quarter, up from 58% in the first quarter, IDC said. Much of that can be attributed to the demise of Huawei, whose smartphone business has been hit by U.S. sanctions, leaving a gap for Apple to fill. \"Keeping prices flat helps Apple to retain its user base and fortify its position in China,\" Ma said."},

That's according to a StreetAccount transcript. \"Based on our estimations, our computing power is sufficient for our autonomous driving technology development in the aspect of the AI training for now,\" Li said. \"And we have been working very closely with our partner Nvidia.\" The Nvidia Drive Orin chip has become a core part of assisted driving tech for Nio and other electric car companies in China. An online Nvidia blog post described how Nio's new ES7 SUV came with four such chips, including one that enabled the car to learn from individual driver preferences. The new U.S. restrictions target Nvidia's A100 and H100 products, whose sales are part of the company's far larger data center business. The products are graphics processors that can be used for artificial intelligence. Li said Wednesday there are many companies in China with artificial intelligence training chips, and that Nio is evaluating opportunities to work with different companies.

Iger, who stepped down from his post as CEO of the Walt Disney Company in February 2020, handing the reins to then-head of theme parks Bob Chapek, said \"choice\" is the main reason moviegoers have not returned to cinemas at the same pace as before. He noted that consumers became more comfortable with streaming services while in lockdown and grew to enjoy the content on these platforms and the flexibility of being able to choose what to watch and when. Iger was quick to add that he doesn't think the movie theater industry is a \"dead business,\" but that the pandemic exacerbated and hastened a change in consumer habits. Between January and the end of August, the domestic box office generated around $5.3 billion, down around 31% compared to 2019. It remains on pace to deliver around $7.5 billion in total ticket sales by the end of the year. For comparison, in 2019 the box office tallied $11.4 billion for the full year. There are other factors leading to this decline in box office, including a significantly smaller number of film releases. Only 46 films have been widely released domestically during the first eight months of the year. During the same period in 2019, 75 films had been released widely. On the plus side, moviegoers are now spending more when they go to cinemas, opting for higher priced tickets to see films on premium screens and buying more concessions. Iger noted that cinemas aren't the only place for audiences to see the birth of major franchises. \"I think the movie industry used to argue that you could not create cultural impact without having everybody go to a movie theater on the weekend in every country in the world,\" he said. \"And then just couldn't create franchises. I don't agree anymore.\" Iger pointed to HBO's \"Game of Thrones\" and Disney's own \"The Mandalorian\" as series that have made significant impacts on the cultural zeitgeist without assistance from cinemas. \"It doesn't mean moviegoing goes away,\" Iger said. \"I'm a big believer in movies. I love big movies ... but it doesn't come back to where it was.\""},

Currently, texts between iPhones use iMessage, which has a much smoother experience than when an Android device texts an iPhone, in which SMS messages show up as green bubbles. Google wants Apple to adopt RCS, a kind of messaging that is meant as a next-generation SMS replacement with encryption and other modern features. The questioner pressed Cook, saying that he can't send videos to his mom because of the limitations of SMS messaging. \"Buy your mom an iPhone,\" Cook said. Cook was joined by former Apple head designer Jony Ive and Laurene Powell Jobs to discuss the legacy of Apple's founder and announce a new Steve Jobs archive and potential documentary. Apple's recent privacy push is not a new goal for the company \u2014 the thinking actually goes back to founder Steve Jobs, Cook said. \"S teve really ingrained in the company in the early days in the importance of privacy and it has only grown since,\" Cook said. Cook cited a 2010 talk by Jobs where he said that privacy means that users consent to share their data. \"Privacy means people know what they're signing up for, in plain English, and repeatedly. That's what it means,\" Jobs said in the talk cited by Cook. Cook's remarks come as the company's privacy push has drawn increasing criticism as self-serving as the company has introduced new privacy features that make online advertising more difficult to measure as Apple reportedly plans to increase the size of its advertising business and introduces new ad units. That's the same philosophy behind App Tracking Transparency, a feature introduced in 2021 that has roiled the online advertising industry. iPhone owners are asked before sharing a unique device identification number with apps when they boot up \u2014 and most iPhone owners choose not to, preventing online advertisers from accurately tracking the performance of their ads. Companies including Facebook parent Meta have blasted the change as anticompetitive. In February, Meta said it would cost it $10 billion this year. \"What we felt is that people should own their data, and they should make their own decision,\" Cook said on Wednesday. \"People should be empowered to be able to make that decision in a really straightforward and simple manner. Not buried 95 pages deep in a privacy policy somewhere.\" Cook elaborated that Apple follows stricter rules than advertisers and defended the company's search ads. \"We've never said digital advertising is a bad thing,\" Cook said. \"What is not good is vacuuming up people's data when they're not doing so on an informed basis.\" Cook was asked if he saw Apple as a powerful company that has stepped in because regulators haven't passed privacy laws. \"We're not trying to be a regulator,\" Cook said. \"All we're trying to do is give people the ability to make the decision for themselves.\""},

Last week, Mississippi's Department of Revenue confirmed with CNBC that student loan forgiveness will be taxable, and the North Carolina Department of Revenue shared the same in a news release. Of course, with state legislation in flux, it's still possible these tax policies, among others, may change. In addition to Indiana, Mississippi and North Carolina, state-level taxation also may be possible in Arkansas, California, Minnesota and Wisconsin, according to a preliminary analysis from the Tax Foundation. The organization initially estimated that 13 states may tax student loan forgiveness and has revised projections with updates. It now projects seven states \u2014 Arkansas, California, Indiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, North Carolina and Wisconsin \u2014 may tax student loan forgiveness. Taxing forgiveness isn't likely in Massachusetts, but the state hasn't shared an official determination. Currently, here's a breakdown of the status in pending states. The Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration on Friday told CNBC that student loan forgiveness may be taxable. However, it depends on what happens in the state legislature in January, said Scott Hardin, a spokesperson for the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration. \"It would be inaccurate to report student loan forgiveness will be taxable in Arkansas as we won't be certain until the legislative session is complete,\" he said. California may also tax student loan forgiveness, depending on how the Department of Education administers the program, a spokesperson from the state's Franchise Tax Board told CNBC. Indiana's Department of Revenue has confirmed with CNBC that student loan forgiveness is taxable at the state, and possibly county level. While the Massachusetts Department of Revenue hasn't made a final determination, state Rep. Steve Owens, a Democrat, said in a tweet that student loan forgiveness won't be taxable. What's more, the state has already issued guidance on conforming to the American Rescue Plan's exclusion, Owens said in a separate tweet. The Mississippi Department of Revenue has confirmed with CNBC that student loan forgiveness will be taxable at the state level. Student loan forgiveness is \"currently considered taxable income,\" according to a news release from the North Carolina Department of Revenue. However, the department is monitoring legislation changes from the state's General Assembly. With the state tax law conforming before the American Rescue Plan Act, it's possible Wisconsin may tax student loan forgiveness, according to the Tax Foundation. Tax-free forgiveness will require a statutory change and action from the state legislature, a spokesperson the Wisconsin Department of Revenue told CNBC. \"We will certainly address this discrepancy with federal law in our upcoming biennial budget request in an effort to ensure Wisconsin taxpayers don't face penalties and increased taxes for having their loans forgiven,\" they said."},

It also said federal agencies should consider information from crypto miners and local utilities \"in a privacy-preserving manner\" to help understand and mitigate the problem. Crypto operations in the U.S. now consume as much energy as all home computers or all residential lighting, the White House said in a report. The findings come amid mounting criticism over the amount of electricity that crypto mining operations produce. The process of cryptocurrency mining involves running banks of computers to solve complicated math equations in order to create new coins and validate transactions. Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, is wedded to this \"proof of work\" system, although the second-most poplar currency, ether, is moving to a different method that may not require as much energy. U.S. crypto production represents between 0.2% and 0.3% of global greenhouse gas emissions and between 0.4% and 0.8% of domestic emissions, respectively, though the estimates are uncertain, the report said. Mining crypto produces planet-warming emissions primarily by burning coal, natural gas and other fossil fuels to generate electricity. This year, crypto mining produced between 110 and 170 million metric tons on carbon pollution across the world and roughly 25 to 50 million metric tons in the U.S. alone, the report said. The process produces electricity by purchasing it from the power grid or by producing and disposing of computers and mining infrastructure. \"Electricity usage from digital assets is contributing to GHG emissions, additional pollution, noise, and other local impacts, depending on markets, policies, and local electricity sources,\" the White House said in the report. \"Depending on the energy intensity of the technology used, crypto-assets could hinder broader efforts to achieve net-zero carbon pollution consistent with U.S. climate commitments and goals,\" it added. The report is a result of President Joe Biden 's executive order in March that called on the government to examine the risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies. The president has pledged to reduce U.S. emissions from 2005 levels at least in half by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The report said that global crypto mining emissions are greater than the emissions of many individual countries and equivalent to the global emissions from all barges, tankers and other ships on inland waterways. Additionally, Bitcoin, the world's largest digital currency by market value, generates approximately two-thirds of global crypto greenhouse gas emissions."},

Having ascended to the throne in 1952 at age 25, Elizabeth became the U.K.'s longest reigning monarch in September 2015 when she surpassed Queen Victoria's record of nearly 64 years. Elizabeth became the world's longest-reigning monarch and head of state when Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej died in October 2016 after he spent 70 years on the throne. During her life, the queen was a patron to hundreds of charities and organizations and was one of the most traveled world leaders. CNBC looks back at some of the British monarch's most memorable moments. Elizabeth was born April 21, 1926, the first child of the then-Duke and Duchess of York. In 1930, Elizabeth's parents gave birth to her sister, Princess Margaret Rose. \"Lilibet\" ascended to the throne sooner than anyone had expected. Her uncle, childless King Edward VIII abdicated in December 1936 over his romance with divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson. Elizabeth's father became King George VI, putting her next in the succession. During World War II, Elizabeth joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service at age 18 in 1945, with the rank of subaltern. By the time the war ended, she had become a junior commander. Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip, her third cousin and a member of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gluecksburg, met in 1934 at the wedding of Philip's cousin, Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark. However, it wasn't until July 1947 until the pair were officially engaged. They married on Nov. 20, 1947, at Westminster Abbey. A year later, Nov. 14, 1948, Elizabeth gave birth to the first of her four children, Prince Charles. Before ascending to the throne, Elizabeth had two children, Charles and Princess Anne (1950), who were then followed by Prince Andrew in 1960 and Prince Edward in 1964. King George VI died on Feb. 6, 1952, making the 25-year-old Elizabeth queen. More than a year later, on June 2, 1953, she was formally crowned at Westminster Abbey in the first British coronation to be televised. Members of the royal family represent numerous organizations and charities worldwide. More than 3,000 groups list a royal as a patron or president. In recent years, the queen was the patron of over 600 organizations, with the causes including the environment, education and health. Being a member of the royal family means attending numerous gatherings from sport and charity to gardening. However, as an avid racegoer and owner of several horses, Elizabeth especially looked forward to attending the Royal Ascot race in Berkshire, a county west of London, every June. Ceremony and pageantry are a core part of the British royal family. Among the regular duties Elizabeth carried out were making the annual Christmas speech and attending \"Trooping the Colour.\" Elizabeth wasn't alone in undertaking national duties. Elizabeth's travels circled the world several times. She met countless leading figures inside and out of Europe. She met with every U.S. president from Harry S. Truman to Joe Biden (in June 2021) except Lyndon Johnson. Elizabeth's relationship with the British public was almost always warm, although she was criticized for remaining at Balmoral Castle in Scotland for several days after the 1997 death of Diana rather than to immediately return to London. The family later said they stayed at Balmoral to protect and prepare the grieving Princes William and Harry, then 15 and 12, for their mother's funeral. In June 2002, the U.K. celebrated 50 years of Elizabeth's reign. Celebrations were held across the country and the queen and the Duke of Edinburgh traveled to every region of the U.K. and the Commonwealth to mark the occasion. On Nov. 20, 1992, the queen's 45th wedding anniversary, a fire at Windsor Castle caused extensive damage that took years to repair. But that was just one of a string of events that prompted the queen declare 1992 to be \"annus horribilis.\" Prince Andrew's separation with the former Sarah Ferguson was announced in March. The next month, Princess Anne divorced Capt. Mark Phillips. In June, Princess Diana's tell-all book was published. Its revelations included husband Charles' affair with Camilla Parker-Bowles. During the coronavirus outbreak, the queen delivered a rare video speech on April 5, 2020, to promise her subjects that they will prevail over the coronavirus. \"We will succeed \u2014 and that success will belong to every one of us. We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return,\" she said from Windsor Castle. Aside from horses, another animal the queen loved was the Pembroke Welsh corgi. As her husband was undergoing treatment for his final illness in early 2021, the queen acquired two puppies, a corgi she named Muick and a dorgi, a cross with a dachshund, she called Fergus. They were named, respectively, after Loch Muick on the Balmoral estate and her late uncle Fergus Bowes-Lyon, who was killed during World War I. Sadly, Fergus the pup died of a heart problem in May at age 5 months. Being a royal, keeping up with appearances and official photographs was just one of the many duties the queen undertook. The queen sat alone as her husband's casket was held by a military honor guard at his funeral at Windsor Castle's St. George's Chapel. Philip died April 9, 2021, at age 99. The funeral was four days before Elizabeth's 95th birthday. The 96-year-old monarch made an appearance in June on the balcony of Buckingham Palace during the first day of her Platinum Jubilee, marking the 70th anniversary of her accession to the throne. She waved to tens of thousands of people gathered below and watched an aviation display in her honor, but was not able to attend many of the events that took place over the four days of celebration due to her declining health. Elizabeth appointed Liz Truss as prime minister on Sept. 6 during a meeting at her Balmoral Castle in Scotland. The meeting was part of a routine in which the queen fulfilled her constitutional role of appointing a new prime minister \u2014 a sequence of events she oversaw 15 times. However, she broke with tradition and appointed Truss from Scotland rather than traveling to Buckingham Palace, as is typical."},

BYD signed a contract Thursday to buy land and build a factory for new energy passenger cars in an industrial park run by local giant WHA Group, according to press releases. The companies did not disclose an investment amount. New energy includes pure battery and hybrid power. The news comes as BYD is expanding quickly into other countries. Notably, the company plans to enter the passenger car market in Japan \u2014 home to auto giant Toyota \u2014 by selling three electric car models to local customers next year. BYD said it announced in early August its official entry into Thailand's passenger car market. The company said the new factory is set to begin operations in 2024, building cars for the local market and for export to countries such as those in Southeast Asia. The cars will also be exported to Europe, WHA said. When the factory opens, annual production capacity will be about 150,000 vehicles, both companies said. WHA noted that by 2030, electric vehicles are expected to account for 30% of Thailand's total car production \u2014 or 700,000 such cars a year. Over roughly the last year, BYD has made many announcements about electric passenger car sales to countries such as Brazil, Australia, Singapore and Norway. Some mark the brand's entry to those markets, although it's unclear whether BYD is selling a meaningful number of cars there yet. For years, much of BYD's business, especially overseas, has focused on commercial vehicles such as buses. But in the last few years the company has quickly become an electric vehicle giant in China, the world's largest auto market. BYD said it sold more than 487,000 purely battery-powered passenger cars for the first eight months of the year \u2014 more than triple the number sold during the same period last year. For a rough comparison, the latest figures from electric car maker Tesla show the company delivered 564,743 vehicles in the first six months of the year. That's up 46% from a year ago. Unlike Tesla's handful of premium-priced models, BYD's numerous models cover a range of prices. BYD has said it stopped producing oil-fueled vehicles since March, and focused instead on battery-powered and hybrid vehicles. As of April 2021, BYD said all of its pure electric vehicles will use the company's self-developed \"Blade\" battery that was first installed in its popular Han luxury sedan."},

The quintessential American SUV brand announced the new vehicles Thursday along with plans for half of its U.S. sales, and all of its European sales, to be all-electric vehicles by 2030. The sales targets are in line with prior ones announced by Jeep's parent company, Stellantis. Jeep executives said the new EV models will be additions to the brand's lineup, not replacements for current models such as its flagship Wrangler off-road SUV. The announcements make for Jeep's most detailed and aggressive electrification plans to date. Previously, the brand was largely focusing on plug-in hybrid electric vehicles that offer all-electric driving in addition to a traditional internal combustion engine. \"Our goal is very clear: Become the global leader in SUV electrification,\" Jeep CEO Christian Meunier said during a media briefing. The company plans to achieve that goal by 2025. The Recon \u2013 a \"brother\" to the Wrangler \u2013 and the electric Grand Wagoneer, called the \"S,\" are expected to go into production in 2024, Jeep said. The automaker is targeting a range of 400 miles on a single charge, 600 horsepower and a 0-60 mph time of around 3.5 seconds for the electric Grand Wagoneer S. The brand did not announce performance expectations for the Recon beyond saying it will offer Wrangler-like off-road capability. Jeep also plans to offer four new EVs in Europe by 2025, including a small SUV called the Avenger that will not be sold in the U.S. Meunier declined to say how many of the vehicles would be sold in both North America and Europe. The Avenger, which is smaller than the brand's entry-level Jeep Renegade, will arrive in European showrooms in early 2023, according to the company. Jeep plans for every vehicle in its lineup to offer some form of \"electrification\" by 2025. That could include hybrid, plug-in hybrid electric or all-electric models. The company declined to forecast what part of its sales will be powered by traditional gasoline-powered engine by 2025 or 2030. Jeep currently offers plug-in hybrid electric versions of its Wrangler and Grand Cherokee in the U.S. The vehicles can travel in all-electric mode before an internal combustion engine kicks on to power the vehicles. The 4x4 electrified models are badged \"4xe,\" a play on the brand's off-road reputation combined with electrification. \"This is just the beginning of an exciting new chapter,\" said Jim Morrison, head of the Jeep brand in North America. \"4xe is the new 4x4.\" Jeep-parent Stellantis' overall electrification strategy includes investing 30 billion euros, now worth $30.1 billion, in electric vehicles and supporting technologies through 2025. The company expects to have 55 electrified vehicles in the U.S. and Europe by 2025 -- 40 all-electric models and 15 plug-in hybrid electric vehicles."},

Here's why America still can't agree on charter schools", "paragraphs": " Whether it's student loan forgiveness or banning books, education policy in the United States can get contentious. One controversial education policy that goes back to the 1990s is the charter school. A charter school is a publicly funded school that is established by a private group. The group creates a contract with the state and local government, which lays out specific accountability requirements. The government has the ability to shut the school down if it doesn't meet those standards. What's more, these schools are exempt from certain state laws and regulations that traditional public schools must follow, but they are expected to meet educational standards. \"We have more autonomy to be able to have a more flexible budget and make just different academic decisions,\" said Natalie Wiltshire, chief operating officer at KIPP Philadelphia Public Schools. KIPP, which stands for the \"Knowledge Is Power Program,\" is the largest charter management organization in the U.S., according to the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools. Nearly 3,000 students attend KIPP schools in Philadelphia. Admission is determined through a lottery system, with 97% of the students identifying as Black or African American and 76% qualifying for free or reduced lunch. \"KIPP has changed my life immensely,\" said Daniel Harris, a KIPP alumnus who is now a teacher at KIPP West Philadelphia Elementary Academy. \"My family was lower income, but I know that's not what [my teachers] saw me as. They saw me as a person who cared about his education, cared about his future, and wanted the best for himself and the people around him. That's what KIPP was about.\" At the organizational level, though, critics say charter schools harm the wider public school district, due to funding and transparency concerns. \"I'm opposed to publicly funded charter schools that are run privately,\" said Joseph Roy, superintendent of schools at the school district in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. \"Don't tell me you're a public school if you're not governed by the public.\" When a child leaves a district-run public school, the tax dollars follow that student to the charter school. Opponents of charter schools say even though the student is leaving the school, it doesn't reduce the traditional public school's costs. \"What winds up happening is there is a downward spiral because as the money goes out with kids, the services the district can provide become less and less,\" said Carol Burris, executive director of the Network for Public Education, an advocacy group that is outspoken against charter schools. \"So more parents leave for charter schools. And it puts some districts in critical places where they're really not able to service the kids that they have.\" \"Right now we're operating parallel school systems and at some point it's going to break,\" Burris said. Watch the video above to learn why charter schools are still so controversial. "},

During a press conference on Thursday, NASA officials said work at the launchpad is ongoing, with the agency's team aiming to complete the replacement of seals on the fueling system by the end of the day. NASA then hopes to conduct a tanking demonstration on Sept. 17 to verify the replacement work was successful. Assuming the work and testing are completed by then, NASA has requested new launch dates from the U.S. Space Force's Eastern Range \u2013 which reviews and approves all missions that liftoff from Cape Canaveral region. The agency has asked to make launch attempts on Sept. 23 and Sept. 27. NASA's associate administrator, Jim Free, noted that crucial to those requests is whether the Space Force will sign off on extending the requirements previously set around the batteries for the rocket's flight termination system, needed in in the event of a problem mid-launch. \"We're trying to plan a path forward if we're allowed to extend our battery retest requirements,\" Free said. NASA needs a waiver from the Eastern Range to move forward with an attempt on either of those launch dates. Without the waiver or completion of the hydrogen leak work, NASA faces the Artemis I mission delaying to October."},

The all-electric crossover is scheduled to go on sale in the U.S. next fall, starting at around $30,000 \u2013 a price level many automakers haven't been able to achieve as the cost to build electric vehicles and the batteries needed to power them continues to rise. GM executives expect the 2024 Equinox EV, officially unveiled Thursday, to become a high-volume seller for the Detroit automaker, as it transitions to exclusively offer electric cars and trucks by 2035. \"We think this is our big opportunity here to really start to get a massive adoption, and we have that expectation with the price; the volume that we expect to do,\" Scott Bell, global vice president of Chevrolet, said during a media briefing. \"This is a game changer for us and for the industry.\" Bell said Equinox EV production at GM's Ramos Arizpe plant in Mexico will ramp up gradually in the coming years. The Equinox EV is expected to join electric versions of the Silverado pickup, Blazer SUV, and the less expensive and smaller Bolt EV and EUV models for Chevrolet. GM CEO Mary Barra last year said the Detroit automaker can \"absolutely\" catch industry leader Tesla in U.S. sales of electric vehicles by 2025. Those plans include more than 1 million units of EV production capacity in China and North America, each, by that time. Barra on Thursday told CNBC's Phil LeBeau that the automaker expects to ramp up production of the Equinox EV far more quickly than its current EVs. She said the vehicle should be close to full production by the first quarter of 2024. The automaker began production of battery cells this year through a joint venture with LG Energy Solution at a plant in Ohio, speeding up EV output. Two other U.S. plants battery plants are also under construction, with a fourth plant expected to be announced soon. \"It is a big year for us. ... This battery plant that we have in Ohio is going to enable us to really start scaling because we're going to have the cells being made in this country,\" Barra said. \"Next year's a huge year. I can't wait because we're going to unleash the power of General Motors.\" The expected starting price of the Equinox EV at roughly $30,000 is less than half the $66,000-plus average transaction price of electric vehicles currently on sale, according to Cox Automotive. The price also brings the Equinox in line with gas-powered compact crossovers/SUVs at an average price of $35,300, according to the auto forecasting and research company. \"An electric Equinox is important to GM because it is a high-volume model in the most popular segment in the industry,\" said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Cox. \"We know from our studies that price of EVs is the No. 1 obstacle to EV adoption with range and charging infrastructure falling. \"Affordable EVs are critical to proliferating EVs.\" The Chevy Bolt, which went on sale in December 2016, was expected to be GM's first affordable, mainstream EV but its annual sales have yet to top 25,000 \u2013 a far cry from mainstream sales such as the gas-powered Equinox at hundreds of thousands of units per year. \"The Bolt has seen mild success but was never really intended as a high-volume EV model,\" said Paul Waatti, manager of industry analysis at AutoPacific. \"The funky design and market positioning require a bit of a unique buyer.\" The Equinox EV will enter a much larger market than the smaller Bolt models. The new crossover is powered by GM's next-generation Ultium electric vehicle platform that's expected to enable more technologies and capabilities compared with the outgoing battery technology of the Bolt models. The Equinox EV is expected to offer between 250 miles and 300 miles of range, depending on the model and battery. A standard front-wheel-drive Equinox is projected to offer 210 horsepower and 242 foot-pounds of torque, with all-wheel-drive models achieving 290-horsepower and 346 foot-pounds of torque. Despite the name, the Equinox EV shares little to nothing with the traditional gas-powered model. It has more in common with the recently unveiled Chevrolet Blazer, which also utilizes GM's Ultium platform and batteries. The Equinox EV will feature better performance than its gas-powered namesake but falls shy of the performance of the Blazer EV, which starts at $45,000 and offers up to 557 horsepower and 648 pounds-foot of torque. The interiors of the electric vehicles also are similar, including a 17.7-inch-diagonal infotainment touch screen that's standard on the Blazer and optional on the Equinox."},

DWAC had already twice adjourned the meeting earlier in the day after previously adjourning it Tuesday. The deadline for the merger was set for Thursday. The vote could decide the fate of a $1.3 billion cash infusion from DWAC's public offering and Trump Media and Technology Group's potential listing on the stock market. DWAC confirmed Thursday that ARC Global Investments II, a company controlled by DWAC CEO Patrick Orlando, initiated a built-in, three-month extension by depositing $2.8 million into DWAC's trust account. The deposit, equivalent to 10 cents per share, pushes the merger deadline to Dec. 8, around two months after the next scheduled special meeting. Given the extra time, DWAC ended its statement by rallying investors to vote in favor of the extension of up to a year. Following the Thursday adjournment, Orlando posted t o Truth Social a reference to \"Star Trek\" along with a photo of a tomahawk steak, a selfie with a white Ford Bronco as well as quotes from Trump and Thomas Jefferson. Shares of DWAC seesawed on light volume after the market closed. Trump Media owns Truth Social, which was founded by the former president after he was banned from Twitter following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Digital World had previously warned that the vote's failure could result in the SPAC's liquidation. The built-in extension buys the company some more time to gather votes and, if liquidation does occur, increases share payout from around $10.20 to around $10.30. DWAC had been scheduled to announce the vote results Tuesday, but Orlando adjourned its special meeting after just two minutes to provide more times for voting. Earlier that day, Reuters had reported that DWAC had failed to garner the votes necessary for the extension, citing sources familiar with the matter. DWAC needs 65% of shareholders to support the extension of the merger deadline. While 20% of those shares are held by Orlando through ARC Global Investments, he says the deal has attracted many retail investors. Orlando has been rallying those investors to vote on Truth Social. The deal has also been the subject of an SEC probe into potential securities violations, stemming from reports that representatives from Trump Media and DWAC discussed the merger prior to DWAC's public offering. Trump Media and Technology Group blamed the SEC for the merger delay, alleging that \"meaningful feedback\" from the commission is long overdue. \"In the interests of simple fairness, the SEC needs to set aside any improper political considerations and bring its review to a swift conclusion,\" a statement from Trump Media read. CNBC reached out to the SEC for comment Thursday. Trump Media has denied reports of financial strife that alleged that the company owed over $1 million to a contractor. The former president has indicated that company may not need the cash infusion from the DWAC deal. \"In any event, I don't need financing, 'I'm really rich!' Private company anyone???\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Saturday."},

Airlines were prohibited from laying off staff as a condition of accepting $54 billion in taxpayer aid to weather the Covid-19 pandemic. Travel demand collapsed in the early days of the crisis. However, carriers were able to urge workers to take early retirement packages or extended leaves of absence. Thousands took them up on the offer, including hundreds of pilots. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., chairwoman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, and James Clyburn, D-S.C., chairman of the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, on Thursday asked the Treasury Department's watchdog to review how airlines used the Covid-19 aid and whether it was used for buyouts or staff reductions, according to a letter reviewed by CNBC. Airlines for America, a trade group which represents American, Delta, United, Southwest and other major U.S. carriers, said the funds from the Payroll Support Program for airlines \"went only to the paychecks of employees, as stipulated by law, and carriers have paid back the government loans.\" \"Without the PSP, our aviation system would look like Europe, Canada or other areas that did not have any similar program,\" the group said in a statement. \"Or even worse, if not for the PSP, we may not be flying at all.\" When travel demand rebounded sharply this year, airlines found themselves short-staffed, including in cockpits. As a result, some airlines, including American and United, cut flights or grounded dozens of planes, particularly to small cities. Shorter routes are flown generally by regional airlines, and airlines have hired hundreds of new pilots from those smaller carriers to fill their own ranks. Labor shortages this year have made it harder for airlines to recover from routine issues such as bad weather. \"As a result of pilot shortages, thousands of flights have been delayed or canceled, wreaking havoc on travel plans for millions of American taxpayers,\" the lawmakers wrote in their letter to Treasury Department Deputy Inspector General Richard Delmar. Delmar confirmed that he received the letter and said his office plans to respond to the lawmakers in the coming days. The Treasury Department declined to comment. Maloney and Clyburn asked the watchdog for preliminary results by Sept. 22. U.S. carriers began 2020 with 456,398 full-time equivalent employees, which fell to 363,354 in November of that year, according to the Department of Transportation. Airlines have been on a hiring spree for more than a year, and in June had 455,642 full-time equivalent employees."},

Oil futures also rose slightly Friday morning, after falling over worries about slowing demand. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen seized an opportunity at a Ford plant in Michigan to tout the Biden administration's economic track record as better than people might think. The biggest thing weighing on the president's approval ratings is voters' low opinion of how he's handled the economy, particularly as inflation surged. But as gas prices have gone down, Biden's ratings have started to tick back up, and the administration is keen to promote some wins ahead of the midterms. \"Taken together, the bipartisan infrastructure law, the CHIPS Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act authorized among the most significant investments our country has ever made,\" Yellen said Thursday. \"I believe firmly, they will help us achieve stable sustainable growth, and they'll move us toward a fairer and more resilient economy.\" Electric vehicle giant Tesla is considering whether to open a lithium-refining facility in Texas, months after CEO Elon Musk said the company may have to refine its own lithium as prices for the resource have soared. The company told Texas authorities that such a plant would be \"the first of its kind in North America.\" Tesla also wants some tax breaks from Texas. \"In the case of the investment on this proposed project in Texas, the decision will be based on a number of commercial and financial considerations, including the ability to obtain relief regarding local property taxes,\" the company told the state. Queen Elizabeth II died Thursday at age 96, concluding a 70-year reign that covered Britain's recovery from World War II, the final decline of the empire, Margaret Thatcher's battles with trade unions, the formation of the European Union and the U.K.'s exit from it, and the Covid pandemic. Elizabeth's passing marks a new era of uncertainty for Britain, writes CNBC's Karen Gilchrist. Just days before her death, the queen met with a new prime minister, Liz Truss, who is tasked with taming the most challenging economy the nation has encountered in years. The pound hit a 37-year low this week, and Truss's government is aiming to alleviate the country's cost-of-living crisis with caps on energy bills. It'll be tough medicine, and Elizabeth won't be there to rally Britons' morale. That's up to King Charles now. The Emmys are Monday, and Apple TV+ is a contender for several major awards.

The firearms maker on Thursday had reported net sales to $84.4 million for its fiscal first quarter, a decrease of 69% from the same time last year. Smith & Wesson Chief Executive Officer Mark Smith blamed the \"challenging\" quarter on the return to normal demand levels and the company needing to correct inventory levels. \"The industry experienced our first normal summer slowdown in three years,\" Smith said in a press release. Additionally, he said manufacturer orders were \"artificially depressed\" as the company's partners sold through existing inventories. Demand for guns had surged in late 2021 and early 2022 amid the pandemic and societal civil unrest related to police killings of unarmed Black people and the presidential election. Analysts agreed with Smith's assessment of the normalization of firearm demand. \"Although disappointed with results that missed our estimates, we think the company remains disciplined in its approach to long-term growth and prudent management of channel inventory,\" a Lake Street analyst said in a note. Smith & Wesson has also been the subject of congressional scrutiny after lawmakers criticized the way gun manufacturers have marketed their products, especially to young men.

Fans of tales from a galaxy far, far away learned more about Disney's plans for the franchise during the company's D23 Expo on Saturday. Kathleen Kennedy, the president of Lucasfilm, took the stage at the D23 Expo to share new details about Lucasfilm's Star Wars projects as well as other franchises under its umbrella, including Willow and Indiana Jones. Here's a breakdown of what audiences can expect from Lucasfilm in the coming years: Kennedy introduced several members of the cast of \"Andor,\" which arrives on Disney+ Sept. 21. Diego Luna stars as Cassian Andor, reprising his role from 2016's \"Rogue One,\" and is an executive producer on the project. Genevieve O'Reilly also returns as Mon Mothma. The series, which Kennedy described as a spy thriller, takes place five years before the events of \"Rogue One.\" Additional cast members include Adria Arjona as Bix, an on-and-off again love interest of Cassian, and Kyle Soller as Syril, a villainous member of the Galactic Empire. Dave Filoni, who ushered in a new age of Star Wars animation with \"Clone Wars,\" revealed a trailer for \"Tales of the Jedi,\" a series of six animated shorts, three focused on Ahsoka Tano and three on Count Dooku. Each short takes place at a different point in each charaters' life, bringing back characters like Qui-Gon Jinn, Anakin Skywalker and Mace Windu. Jon Favreau, Filoni's partner on \"The Mandalorian\" series, arrived to discuss the live-action \"Ahsoka\" series starring Rosario Dawson in the title role and share details on other projects the Lucasfilm team is working on. Favreau announced that Jon Watts, who directed \"Spider-Man: No Way Home,\" is helming \"Skeleton Crew,\" an upcoming Disney+ show set in the New Republic, along side Chris Ford. The series stars Jude Law and follows a group of four kids as they try to make their way home. Little else was shared about the project, which is currently in production. To celebrate the third season of \"The Mandalorian,\" Filoni and Favreau brought out fellow executive producer Rick Famuyiwa alongside the cast, including Pedro Pascal, Katee Sackhoff, Emily Swallow, Amy Sedaris and Giancarlo Esposito. Lucasfilm provided a teaser for the new season, which promises even more armored Mandalorians, high-octane action and lots of the child known as Grogu. The next season arrives on Disney+ in 2023. James Mangold the director of the fifth \"Indiana Jones\" showed footage of the next installment in the franchise, which features Harrison Ford in the title role. The action-packed clips showcased epic car chases and Ford racing through a subway on horseback. Ford, who was visibly emotional while on stage, received a standing ovation and said the new \"Indiana Jones\" is \"a movie that will kick your a--.\" He also noted that this will be he last turn as the archeologist adventurer saying, with a laugh, \"I will not fall down for you again.\" The film, which also stars Phoebe Waller-Bridge, arrives in cinemas on June 30, 2023. Warwick Davis, reprising his role as Willow, took the stage alongside Christian Slater and other members of the cast of \"Willow\" to share a trailer for the new Disney+ series.

These 5 charts show how it went", "paragraphs": " It was a pricey and chaotic summer for air travel. A bigger share of flights were delayed or canceled during the main late spring and summer travel season, which runs from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day, compared with the same period of pre-pandemic 2019. Fares surged along with fuel prices and as millions of consumers booked trips after two years of forgoing flights. Domestic round trips averaged $342 between May and September, nearly 11% more than the same period in 2019, according to fare-tracker Hopper. Labor shortages made it even harder for airlines to recover from routine events. Overambitious carriers trimmed their packed schedules to give their operations more breathing room. Overwhelmed European hubs capped passenger numbers. Even airline employee travel perks were scaled back. Government agencies and airlines sparred over who was to blame. And on Sept. 1, the Department of Transportation published a dashboard that spells out what customers are owed when airlines delay or cancel their flights. Fares are finally starting to decline along with temperatures, but vacation travel demand is still strong, executives said this week. \"We're seeing a really strong September,\" Patrick Quayle, United Airlines ' senior vice president of global network planning and alliances, said at a Cowen industry conference this week. \"It does not appear that summer has come to an end. It's that strong.\" As airlines prepare for the fall \u2014 and busy year-end holidays \u2014 here's how they handled the heat this summer: Passenger numbers this summer surged compared with the past two years. During Labor Day weekend, the Transportation Security Administration screened about 8.76 million people, marking the first holiday weekend since the Covid pandemic began that was busier than one in 2019. Airlines canceled or delayed a greater share of their flights compared with 2019. Thinner staffing levels and training backups meant they had fewer crew members to step in when scheduled employees like pilots reached federally mandated workday limits. Operations improved in August and over the important Labor Day weekend for some airlines. Delta Air Lines reduced cancellations by 25% in August compared with July, CEO Ed Bastian said in a staff memo Thursday, which was reviewed by CNBC. Over Labor Day the carrier canceled 15 mainline flights out of 16,636 departures, he said. Airport delays varied around the country but some of the biggest hubs had greater shares of late-arriving flights, often driven by spring and summer storms. Traveler complaints to the Transportation Department soared, along with flight disruptions. By some metrics, however, like mishandled baggage, U.S. airlines performed similarly to 2019. Domestic round-trip fares surged this spring, reaching a peak in May of $404, up 25% from three years ago, according to Hopper data. But a drop in prices, combined with a seasonal lull as business travel remains below 2019 volumes, is making for some fall deals. Domestic airfare is averaging $299 in September, still up 2% from the same month three years ago. And airline executives expect travel demand to spike around the holidays. \"Though we'll slow down for a bit following the summer peak, the holiday travel season will be here before you know it,\" American Airlines COO David Seymour told employees this week."},

Animated movies released theatrically have floundered at the box office in the wake of the pandemic. At first, parents were reticent to bring kids back to cinemas, but now it seems that lackluster titles and an increase in children's content on streaming have contributed to keeping families at home. Disney has exacerbated this issue since movie theaters reopened, as it has placed the majority of its new Pixar films on Disney+ including \"Turning Red,\" \"Soul\" and \"Luca.\" While these decisions were made at time when vaccinations were either not available to children and moviegoing foot traffic was slow, it trained consumers to expect these titles on streaming. It's part of the reason that \"Lightyear\" had a lackluster opening in theaters this summer. Of course, the film was also hurt by a confusing premise that deviated from what made the Toy Story franchise so special. Disney revealed ew titles from Pixar and its Walt Disney Animation Studio as well as films associated with its live-action remakes during Friday's panel. It will also share which films will head to theaters and which will arrive by way of Disney+. Pete Docter, the chief creative officer of Pixar, took the stage at the D23 Expo to announce new titles from the animation studio that will arrive in theaters and on Disney+ in the coming years. \"Elemental,\" arriving in summer 2023, tells the story of a bustling metropolis where earth, air, fire and water elements live. But when a fire girl and a water boy develop a connection the two must navigate how to interact while being polar opposites. Director Peter Sohn noted the film also touches on themes of immigration and finding your place in the world. The company is launching its first ever long-form series on Disney+ called \"Win or Lose.\" The show is the brain child of two storyboard artists and tells the story of the Pickles softball team in the week ahead of their championship game. Each episode takes place during the same week, but from a perspective of a different main character. \"Elio\" is a new project from the studio that centers on an 11-year-old named Elio who is just trying to fit in. His mother is working on a top secret military project to decode alien messages, but its Elio who accidentally makes first contact and becomes the de facto emissary for Earth. The film will debut in spring 2024. Amy Poehler joined Docter on stage to announce Pixar will be making a sequel to 2015's \"Inside Out.\" Riley is now a teenager and there are new emotions joining the mix. The movie arrives in summer 2024. Jennifer Lee, chief creative officer of Walt Disney Animation Studios, announced several new projects from the studio. To start, Lee said \"Zootopia+\" will arrive in November. The show is a series of shorts following major characters from the 2016 feature film. Disney is partnering with Kugali Media to bring \"Iwaju\" to Disney+. The series is set in Nigeria and follows a young heiress named Tola and a poor boy named Kole. It arrives on the streaming service in 2023. The studio shared a trailer of \"Strange Worlds,\" which arrives in theaters Thanksgiving 2022. The film centers on the Clades, a family of explorers, who must rely on each other in spite of their differences to traverse an uncharted and treacherous new land. \"Wish\" is Disney Animations 2023 feature film. It explores how the dreaming star, upon which so many Disney characters have wished upon, came to be. The film is set within the Kingdom of Roses and follows Asha, an optimist with a sharp wit. Asha sees a darkness in the kingdom that no one else does, so in a moment of desperation she makes a passionate plea to the stars. This calls down an actual star from the sky named Star with magical wish-granting powers. Asha is played by Ariana DeBose as Asha and Alan Tudyk as Valentino, a goat. DeBose sang an original song from the film and Tudyk ran through his repertoire of Disney characters including Duke Weaselton from \"Frozen,\" Hei Hei from \"Moana\" and King Candy from \"Wreck-it Ralph.\" Ahead of reveals about its animated content, Disney unveiled new trailers for \"Hocus Pocus 2,\" which arrives on Disney+ Sept. 30, as well as \"Disenchanted,\" the sequel to 2007's \"Enchanted,\" out on the streaming service Nov 24. On the heels of the release of \"Pinocchio\" on Disney+ on Thursday, the studio announced a slew of new additions to its catalog of Disney live-action remakes. \"Peter Pan & Wendy\" starring Alexander Molony as Peter, Ever Anderson as Wendy and Alyssa Wapanatahk as Tiger Lily is slated for release on Disney+ in 2023. Jude Law portrays Captain Hook. \"Haunted Mansion\" is slated to arrive in theaters March 10, 2023. Directed by Justin Simien, a former Disneyland cast member, the film is filled with Easter eggs culled from the famous Disney parks ride. During the panel, Simien announced that Jamie Lee Curtis will star as Madam Leota in the film. Barry Jenkin's formerly untitled Lion King project is called \"Mufasa: The Lion King\" and tells the origin story of Mufasa from cub to king. Clips shared with audiences at the D23 Expo shows the same stunning visuals as 2019's \"The Lion King\" and will arrive in theaters in 2024. The company also shared a brief glimpse of \"Snow White\" due out in theaters in 2024. The film stars Rachel Zegler as the title character and Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen. Fans erupted in applause when Gadot took the stage. The \"Wonder Woman\" actress said it was fun to play the villain, having been so often cast in more heroic roles. Both Zegler and Anderson noted that the studio worked to give classic characters like Snow White and Wendy more agency and provide a modern take on these classic tales. Rob Marshall, the director of Disney's remake of \"The Little Mermaid,\" shared the entire sequence of \"Part of Your World\" from the film. Halle Bailey's performance received raucous applause and a standing ovation when she stepped out on stage. The film arrives in theaters May 26, 2023."},

The Restaurant Brands International chain unveiled a turnaround plan for its U.S. business in Las Vegas at its annual franchisee convention. The investments are expected to weigh on its adjusted earnings per share for 2022 and 2023 by 10 to 12 cents annually. The company expects the investments to start paying off by 2025. Wall Street analysts surveyed by Refinitiv expect earnings per share of $3.24 in 2023. In the second quarter, Burger King reported flat U.S. same-store sales growth, trailing behind rivals McDonald's and Wendy's. The burger chain has been reporting lackluster U.S. sales over the last year, causing concern for Restaurant Brands CEO Jose Cil. In his tenure as chief executive, Cil has also spearheaded efforts to revive Canadian demand for Tim Hortons, Burger King's sister chain. A year ago, Cil also tapped former Domino's Pizza executive Tom Curtis as the new president for Burger King's U.S. and Canadian restaurants. Early changes to Burger King included slimming its menu to speed up drive-thru times and cutting down its paper coupons to push customers to use its mobile app. Now Burger King is preparing to make even bolder changes. It's planning to spend $200 million to fund remodels of roughly 800 locations. Another $50 million will go toward upgrading about 3,000 restaurants with technology, kitchen equipment and building enhancements. The company has more than 7,000 Burger King locations in the U.S. Historically, remodeled restaurants see an average sales increase of 12% in their first year and outperform older locations over time, according to Burger King. The company is hoping that being more selective and strategic with its projects will produce even stronger sales growth, although it could take longer to see results. \"We might see remodels start to hit the market mid-2023 and going forward. It should really be a gradual ramp of the business over the course of the couple of years,\" Cil told CNBC. Burger King will also increase its U.S. advertising fund's budget by 30% by investing $120 million over the next two years. Those investments will start in the fourth quarter. \"We expect that to start having an impact on sales over the next quarter,\" Cil said. An additional $30 million will be spent through 2024 on improving its mobile app, exceeding the digital fees that franchisees pay to the company for the technology. Burger King's menu will also get a facelift. The company said it's built a multi-year blueprint for menu improvements, which include developing new Whopper flavors, betting on its Royal Chicken Crispy sandwich and investing in more employee training. The strategy has received support from franchisees operating 93% of its U.S. restaurants, according to Burger King. Operators will be chipping in their own money alongside the company for remodels and advertising. Curtis and h is team put together a group of franchisees, representing a range of regions and experience, to come up with the strategy over the last three to six months. \"There were many long nights and plane rides,\" Curtis said. In addition to the money they get from Burger King, franchisees making upgrades to their restaurants are expected to make comparabl e i nvestments to fund the projects. The company is also changing its incentive structure to encourage operators to make more extensive remodels, which can be costly and typically require a location to be temporarily shuttered. In the past, Burger King operators who remodeled their restaurants received discounts on their advertising and royalty fees for up to seven years. The new program will give franchisees cash once the project is completed, and let them choose how much of a discount they get on the royalties they pay to the company. If profitability targets are met, however, Burger King franchisees will have to pay higher fees toward the advertising fund."},

In 2022, organizations with paid maternity leave dropped to 35% from 53% in 2020, according to the Society for Human Resource Management's employee benefits survey. And fewer than one-third, 27%, now provide paid paternity leave, down from 44% in 2020. \"A lot of these firms are now trying to get back to pre-pandemic norms,\" said Michelle Long, a policy analyst at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. More from Personal Finance:\nBorrowers in these states may owe taxes on student loan forgiveness\nInflation fears spur shoppers to get an early jump on the year-end holidays\nCiti expands program to boost homeownership in diverse communities During the pandemic, many companies enhanced offerings beyond what is required by state law, but now \"purse strings have tightened\" as the economy has shifted, Long said. Currently, there isn't a federal paid leave program, and only 11 states plus the District of Columbia offer the benefit, typically funded by payroll taxes, according to data from the National Conference of State Legislatures. \"This is a very, very expensive offering, particularly for small and medium-sized companies,\" said Johnny Taylor, Jr., president and CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management, explaining that some firms may pay wages for the employee on leave and a replacement at the same time. However, as the labor market softens, \"the game is changing a little bit,\" he said, and companies are cutting back on previously enhanced paid parental leave policies. Whether you're a current employee or weighing job offers, it's important to know the details of your company's parental leave policy if you're planning to grow your family, Taylor said. \"Oftentimes, the temptation is to take a job with the highest salary without factoring in things like their paid leave offering,\" he said. If you're interviewing, ask for an overview of the company's full benefits package, he suggested. While using vacation time for parental leave is another option, he urged future parents to weigh the pros and cons before depleting paid days off for the year. \"Nurturing a new baby is not a vacation,\" Taylor said. \"If you spend all your vacation time doing that, you're going to burn out.\" Future parents may also consider coordinating benefits or taking paid leave separately, suggested Nicole Sullivan, a certified financial planner and co-founder of Prism Planning Partners in Libertyville, Illinois. \"Fully understanding and coordinating all company benefits is another major help \u2014 things like flexible spending or dependent care accounts and medical benefits,\" she said. \"Many companies have benefits open enrollment in November, so it's a good time for parents and parents-to-be to review,\" Sullivan added."},

To clear products off shelves in the meantime, retailers including Macy's and Nordstrom have turned to markdowns that are cutting into profits. \"The retail environment's not pretty,\" Jeffries analyst Corey Tarlowe told CNBC. \"Inventories have been elevated. There's billions of dollars of excess apparel inventory that's floating out around there right now, and that's a problem.\" On Wednesday, American Eagle said it was suspending its dividend after comparable sales in the latest quarter fell 6% from a year ago. Chief Operating Officer Mike Mathias pointed to a \"slowdown in demand\" caused by the macroeconomic environment. Jen Foyle, the company's chief merchandising officer, said American Eagle's priorities are \"adjusting our assortments and rightsizing inventory.\" The need for markdowns to move inventory hurt American Eagle's bottom line, with the company posting earnings of 4 cents per share for the quarter ending July 30. That fell short of the 13 cents per share expected by analysts. On Thursday, Nordstrom Chief Financial Officer Anne Bramman also said at the Goldman Sachs Global Retailing Conference that discounts have been \"a lot deeper\" than the company had expected and that it could \"take a couple quarters\" to properly readjust. The department store operator in August had reported stronger sales for its second quarter, but slashed its financial forecast for the year citing a glut of inventory and slowing demand later in the quarter. Rival Macy's also last month slashed its revenue and earnings forecast for the year, with Chief Financial Officer Adrian Mitchell noting \"weakening apparel sales over the quarter as the consumer faces higher costs on essential goods, particularly grocery. At Thursday's Goldman conference, Mitchell said that the company has \"taken the markdowns necessary\" to help clear inventory. Other retailers including Wal-Mart, Target, Gap and Kohl's have faced similar problems with bloated inventories. Target cited its deep discounting to get rid of excess inventory when it reported a 90% decline in quarterly profit in August. Chief Financial Officer Michael Fiddelke said there was \"softness\" in apparel and other discretionary categories. Noting an inflation-wary consumer, Wal-Mart employed similarly aggressive markdowns to move items like clothing out of stores, which led to a significant cut in profit expectations. Gap and Kohl's, meanwhile, are looking to avoid some markdowns with a \"pack-and-hold\" strategy for certain items, which allows them to reserve excess inventory until demand rises. By 2023, Tarlowe the analyst said retailers might be able to adjust more quickly to demand as the supply chain normalizes. But for now, he said companies are struggling to adjust their offerings. \"All that product that was initially ordered for soft and cozy trends is now coming in. These retailers have been stuck with it. They're forced to clear it out. It's not in the right categories,\" Tarlowe said."},
{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/11/where-walmart-amazon-target-are-spending-billions-in-slowing-economy.html", "title": "Where Walmart, Amazon and Target are spending billions in a slowing economy", "paragraphs": " When the economy slows down, the classic response for consumer businesses is to cut back: slow hiring, maybe lay off workers, slash marketing, or even slow the pace of technology investment, delaying projects until after business has picked up again. But that's not at all what America's troubled retail sector is doing this year. With the S&P Retail Index down nearly 30% this year, most of the industry is boosting investment in capital spending by double digits, including industry leaders Walmart and Amazon.com. Among the top tier, only struggling clothier Gap and home-improvement chain Lowe's are cutting back significantly. At electronics retailer Best Buy, first-half profits fell by more than half \u2013 but investment rose 37 percent. \"There is definitely concern and awareness about costs, but there is a prioritization happening,\" said Thomas O'Connor, vice president of supply chain-consumer retail research at consulting firm Gartner. \"A lesson has been taken from the aftermath of the financial crisis,\" O'Connor said. That lesson? Investments made by big-spending leaders like Walmart, Amazon and Home Depot are likely to result in taking customers from weaker rivals next year, when consumer discretionary cash flow is forecast to rebound from a year-long 2022 drought and revive shopping after spending on goods actually shrank early this year. After the 2007-2009 downturn, 60 companies Gartner classified as \"efficient growth companies\" that invested through the crisis saw earnings double between 2009 and 2015, while other companies' profits barely changed, according to a 2019 report on 1,200 U.S. and European firms. Companies have taken that data to heart, with a recent Gartner survey of finance executives across industries showing that investments in technology and workforce development are the last expenses companies plan to cut as the economy struggles to keep recent inflation from causing a new recession. Budgets for mergers, environmental sustainability plans and even product innovation are taking a back seat, the Gartner data shows. Today, some retailers are improving how supply chains work between the stores and their suppliers. That's a focus at Home Depot, for example. Others, like Walmart, are driving to improve in-store operations so that shelves are restocked more quickly and fewer sales are lost. The trend toward more investment has been building for a decade, but was catalyzed by the Covid pandemic, Progressive Policy Institute economist Michael Mandel said. \"Even before the pandemic, retailers were shifting from investments in structures to active investments in equipment, technology and software,\" Mandel said. \"[Between 2010 and 2020], software investment in the retail sector rose by 123%, compared to a 16% gain in manufacturing.\" At Walmart, money is pouring into initiatives including VizPick, an augmented-reality system linked to worker cell phones that lets associates restock shelves faster. The company boosted capital spending 50% to $7.5 billion in the first half of its fiscal year, which ends in January. Its capital spending budget this year is expected to rise 26 percent to $16.5 billion, CFRA Research analyst Arun Sundaram said. \"The pandemic obviously changed the entire retail environment,\" Sundaram said, forcing Walmart and others to be efficient in their back offices and embrace online channels and in-store pickup options even more. \"It made Walmart and all the other retailers improve their supply chains. You see more automation, less manual picking [in warehouses] and more robots.\" Last week, Amazon announced its latest warehouse robotics acquisition, Belgian firm Cloostermans, which offers technology to help move and stack heavy palettes and goods, as well as package products together for delivery. Home Depot's campaign to revamp its supply chain has been underway for several years, O'Connor said. Its One Supply chain effort is actually hurting profits for now, according to the company's financial disclosures, but it's central to both operating efficiency and a key strategic goal \u2013 creating deeper ties to professional contractors, who spend far more than the do-it-yourselfers who have been Home Depot's bread and butter. \"To serve our pros, it's really about removing friction through a multitude of enhanced product offerings and capabilities,\" executive vice president Hector Padilla told analysts on Home Depot's second-quarter call. \"These new supply chain assets allow us to do that at a different level.\" Some broadline retailers are more focused on refreshing an aging store brand. At Kohl's, the highlight of this year's capital spending budget is an expansion of the firm's relationship with Sephora, which is adding mini-stores within 400 Kohl's stores this year. The partnership helps the middle-market retailer add an element of flair to its otherwise stodgy image, which contributed to its relatively weak sales growth in the first half of the year, said Landon Luxembourg, a retailing expert at consulting firm Third Bridge. First-half investment more than doubled this year at Kohl's. Roughly $220 million of the increase in Kohl's spending was related to investment in beauty inventory to support the 400 Sephora shops opening in 2022, according to chief financial officer Jill Timm said. \"We'll continue that into next year. \u2026We're looking forward to working with Sephora on that solution to all of our stores,\" she told analysts on the company's most recent earnings call in mid-August. Target is spending $5 billion this year as it adds 30 stores and upgrades another 200, bringing its tally of stores renovated since 2017 to more than half of the chain. It also is expanding its own beauty partnership first unveiled in 2020, with Ulta Beauty, adding 200 in-store Ulta centers en route to having 800. And the biggest spender of all is Amazon.com, which had over $60 billion in capital expenditures in 2021. While Amazon's reported capital spending numbers include its cloud computing division, it spent nearly $31 billion on property and equipment in the first half of the year \u2014 up from an already record breaking 2021 \u2014 even though the investment made the company's free cash flow turn negative. That is enough to make even Amazon tap the brakes a little bit, with chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky telling investors Amazon is shifting more of its investment dollars to the cloud computing division. This year, it estimates roughly 40% of spending will support warehouses and transportation capacity, down from last year's combined 55%. It also plans to spend less on worldwide stores \u2014 \"to better align with customer demand,\" Olsavksy told analysts after its most recent earnings \u2014 already a much smaller budget item on a percentage basis. At Gap \u2014 which has seen its shares declined by nearly 50% this year \u2014 executives defended their cuts in capital spending, saying they need to defend profits this year and hope to rebound in 2023. \"We also believe there's an opportunity to slow down more meaningfully the pace of our technology and digital platform investments to better optimize our operating profits,\" chief financial officer Katrina O'Connell told analysts after its most recent earnings. And Lowe's deflected an analyst's question about spending cuts, saying it could continue to take market share from smaller competitors. Lowe's has been the better stock market performer compared to Home Depot over the past one-year and year-to-date periods, though both have seen sizable declines in 2022. \"Home improvement is a $900 billion marketplace,\" Lowe's CEO Marvin Ellison said, without mentioning Home Depot. \"And I think it's easy to just focus on the two largest players and determine the overall market share gain just based on that, but this is a really fragmented marketplace.\""},

The league will introduce clocks that limit time between batters and between pitches, limit defensive shifts and increase the size of bases in next year's season. The announcement came after reports that the league has struggled to bring in attendance above pre-pandemic levels. MLB is also seeking to expand its audience through streaming, such as with its deal with Apple TV+. Rule changes in recent years have been similarly crafted to increase game intrigue, like starting every extra inning with a man on base. The new rules include a 30-second timer to speed up time between batters. Pitchers will have 15 seconds between pitches when the bases are empty, but, with runners on base, that time will expand to 20 seconds. If a pitcher violates the timer, he will be charged an automatic ball. If a batter violates the limit, he will be charged an automatic strike. The defensive shift rule change is an attempt to increase batting average on balls put in play, particularly from batters who tend to hit mainly to one side of the field. The rule keeps the four infielders within the infield, and prevents them from switching sides. The limit should allow for more offensive action and force defenses to make more athletic plays. MLB is also increasing the size of bases from 15 inches square to 18 inches square. This gives infielders more distance between themselves and baserunners, in a bid to decrease collisions. The change also decreases base-to-base distance by 4.5 inches."},

Personal cars sit parked about 95% of the time, according to a study by the RAC Foundation. And they take up valuable real estate in urban areas. Roads and parking occupy nearly a quarter of Manhattan, for example, while only 22% of households in the borough owns a car, according to census data. Cars were banned on a stretch of Broadway by Times Square in 2009. While initially controversial, this change quickly decreased traffic accidents, especially those involving pedestrians, and increased foot traffic in the neighborhood, according to HR&A Advisors. There's also been an effort by a coalition made up in part by unions and health public health organizations to turn 25% of the land used by cars into land for people in New York City by 2025. \"I think it's proved itself over and over. It is a very good example of what you can do when you take space away from single occupancy motor vehicles and give it to people on foot or on bikes,\" said Eric McClure, the executive director and treasurer of StreetsPAC. Creating pedestrian plazas like the one in Times Square is prevalent in many European and Asian cities like Amsterdam and Tokyo. They prioritize public transportation and cycling infrastructure while U.S. cities often favor cars. \"I think the young people broadly are kind of dissatisfied with the status quo of what cities look like,\" said Paul Stout who runs the urban developing TikTok account 'TalkingCities.' \"There's this big push for walkable cities and transit-rich places.\" Culdesac, a real-estate developer, is appealing to younger generations' desire for walkable cities by creating the United States' first walkable community built entirely from scratch. The development in Tempe, Arizona, which is set to begin opening toward the end of 2022, is fully-equipped with e-scooters, rentable EVs, e-bike storage and is connected to the local light rail system. It also has retail and community spaces like a park and pool, and residents will get a discount on ride share services. Lyft co-founder John Zimmer is on the board. The company said it has raised $200 million in real estate capital. For U.S. cities to become more walkable, the implementation of congestion tolls, reduced and paid parking, could be necessary. Cities could convert some of this space into pedestrian plazas, outdoor-retail space as well as add cycling and public transportation infrastructure. \"Once there's an emphasis on the quality of the public realm, you're making life better for many, many people,\" said Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk who is an architect, urban designer and professor at the University of Miami.

{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/08/clean-hydrogen-industry-got-huge-boost-from-inflation-reduction-act.html", "title": "The clean hydrogen energy economy was a dream. The climate bill could make it a reality this decade", "paragraphs": " A tax credit tucked into Inflation Reduction Act could turbocharge the nascent clean hydrogen industry and turn it into a multitrillion-dollar business in the coming decades. The tax credit will spur hydrogen producers to develop cleaner ways to synthesize hydrogen, which is used to make fertilizer and in other industrial processes. But it could also catalyze a whole new category of companies looking to use clean hydrogen as a replacement for fossil fuels in areas such as shipping, aviation, heavy industry, and as a way to store and transport energy. Currently, 98 percent of hydrogen is made in a way that uses fossil fuels, according to the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. But \"all the current hydrogen producers are looking to produce clean hydrogen,\" explained Elina Teplinsky, a lawyer who serves as the spokesperson for the Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative, a group working to advance the development of the nuclear hydrogen industry. The law will make it more economically feasible to use carbon capture and storage technology to reduce the carbon emissions from hydrogen creation. It will also open the door to a whole range of companies looking for cleaner ways to make hydrogen, and to use hydrogen as a replacement for fossil fuels in certain areas. By 2050, between 60 and 80 percent of hydrogen production will be powered by renewables, according to a November report on the industry published by the Hydrogen Council, an industry group, in collaboration with McKinsey & Co. (This prediction was published before the tax credit was passed.) This kind of industry transition will require a lot of investment \u2014 as much as $7 trillion to $8 trillion through 2050. But on the plus side, by that date the hydrogen economy could generate about $3 trillion in annual revenue, according to the Hydrogen Council and McKinsey report. Currently, roughly half of the hydrogen produced is used to make fertilizer and ammonia, with the balance used in petrochemical refineries or production, according to the Center on Global Energy Policy. The push for clean hydrogen is motivated both by a need to decarbonize current processes and because the use cases for hydrogen are expanding. Industrial applications, which make up nearly all the demand for hydrogen today, will represent only 15% of total hydrogen demand by 2050, according to the Hydrogen Council/McKinsey report. Hydrogen has the highest energy per mass of any fuel and does not release any carbon emissions when it is burned or turned to electricity in a fuel cell. Entrepreneurs and advocates believe hydrogen could be useful to decarbonize some very large sectors of the economy like long-haul trucking and industrial processes including making iron and steel, maritime cargo shipping, and aviation. \"If it weren't for climate change, we probably wouldn't be expanding into all of these new use cases\" for hydrogen, Emily Kent, the U.S. director of zero-carbon fuels at Clean Air Task Force, a global climate nonprofit, told CNBC. The largest end use for hydrogen by 2050 is expected to be mobility, including heavy trucking, long-range flights and container ships, according to the Hydrogen Council/McKinsey report. In these cases, hydrogen would produce electricity through a fuel cell, in which hydrogen atoms and oxygen atoms are combined in an electrochemical reaction to generate electricity, heat and water. Current electric battery-powered vehicles can't meet this need because batteries that could store enough energy for long-haul journeys would be too heavy and would take too long to recharge, Kent explained. A hydrogen tank and fuel cell would weigh less, take up less space and have the refueling time similar to gas or diesel. \"It's possible that there'll be huge breakthroughs and batteries or something else that would change things. But as it stands today, there aren't great solutions,\" Kent told CNBC. Hydrogen can also be burned to produce electricity in a turbine, similar to natural gas. Currently, up to 20% hydrogen can be blended with natural gas burned in conventional natural gas turbines without needing to do any infrastructure changes, according to Kent. \"For higher blends of hydrogen or pure hydrogen, we'll likely need adjustments to the turbines and infrastructure,\" Kent told CNBC. \"There are companies working on 100% hydrogen-ready infrastructure where pure hydrogen can be burned in a turbine to produce electricity.\" Hydrogen can be a way to store energy, which is going to be critical as renewable energy like wind and solar are ramped up and deployed across the country. Wind and solar energy don't work when the wind doesn't blow or the sun doesn't shine, and so energy has to be stored somehow to be able to provide continuous, reliable energy. Meanwhile, battery technology is being ramped up, but batteries are not yet at the point in their development where they can store enough energy for long enough to make them sufficient backup for a fully renewable grid. \"If you produce a ton of solar in the summer, and you want to store a bunch of it away for the winter, hydrogen can be stored for sort of that many monthslong seasonal periods, and provide electricity back to the system when it's needed,\" Kent said. Cleanly produced hydrogen is also being considered as a replacement for coking coal in a key part of the process in producing steel, a heavy-emissions industry which is considered a real challenge to decarbonize. And clean hydrogen will be needed for industrial processes that require especially high-grade heat, temperatures above 752 degrees Fahrenheit, like cement plants, glassmaking, and aluminum remelting, according to the Hydrogen Council/McKinsey report. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, but here on Earth, it only exists in compound forms with other elements \u2014 particularly with oxygen as part of water. Separating the hydrogen from the other atoms requires industrial processes and energy. Currently, China is the largest producer of hydrogen, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a bipartisan, nonprofit policy research organization. Of the hydrogen that China makes, 60 percent is made using coal and about 25 percent comes from using natural gas, according to CSIS. Outside of China, the largest hydrogen producers are industrial gas companies like Linde and AirProducts, according to Teplinsky. Seventy-six percent of hydrogen produced globally and 95% in the U.S. is produced with a process called steam methane reforming, in which a source of methane, like natural gas, reacts with steam at very high temperatures, according to the Center on Global Energy Policy. Natural gas releases greenhouse gas emissions when burned, and also from so-called fugitive methane leaks as it's extracted and transported. Globally, 22% (and 4% in the U.S.) is made with a process called coal gasification, where coal reacts with oxygen and steam in hot temperature and high pressure. Some companies are working to capture the carbon dioxide emissions from these processes and store it in tanks underground. Hydrogen made this way is sometimes called \"blue hydrogen.\" More promisingly from an emissions perspective, an electrolyzer can be used to split a water molecule into hydrogen and oxygen, and it can be powered with almost any energy source \u2014 including zero-emissions sources like solar or wind, creating what is known as \"green hydrogen.\" Today, two percent of the hydrogen made globally and 1 percent in the U.S. is made with an electrolyzer. Nuclear energy can also be used to power hydrogen synthesis with almost no additional CO2 emissions (this is sometimes called \"pink hydrogen,\" but the nomenclature varies). As a bonus, the steam and heat produced as byproducts of nuclear energy can be used in a high temperature electrolysis process, which is much more efficient. And with the advanced nuclear reactors in development that run at even hotter temperatures than conventional nuclear reactors, hydrogen can be produced in a thermo-chemical water-splitting process that doesn't use an electrolyzer at all. Because the majority of the cost of producing hydrogen with electrolysis is the cost of the electricity that goes into it, making hydrogen with nuclear energy and steam \"really could have a tremendous contribution on lowering the costs of clean hydrogen production,\" Teplinsky told CNBC. The cost of producing hydrogen with these different methods varies tremendously and swings based on input costs, like natural gas and the source of power. Because of the Russian war in Ukraine and climate change, these input costs have themselves been swinging. A report published by nonpartisan nonprofit Resources for the Future in December 2020 said a kilogram of hydrogen made with steam methane reforming cost between $1 and $2 (including the costs of some carbon capture). Hydrogen made with electrolysis powered by wind and solar ranged from between $3 and $7 per kilogram. That's where the tax credit comes in. The tax credit in the IRA is available for 10 years and scales depending on how clean the hydrogen production is. If hydrogen is produced without releasing any carbon emissions, the tax credit is maxed out at $3 per kilogram of hydrogen produced. It then scales down proportionally based on the amount of emissions released, as long as it's less than current production techniques. If hydrogen is produced with some carbon emissions, but fewer than are emitted in current production techniques, the tax credit is incrementally smaller, proportional to the emissions reductions. The tax credit is \"an absolute game-changer,\" Akshay Honnatti, the leader of EY's sustainability tax division for the United States, told CNBC. \"There was no incentive to have hydrogen be cleaner. It costs to get hydrogen to be cleaner,\" Honnatti added. \"Now there's a credit available for someone to make that additional level of investment and be able to justify that level of investment to their stakeholders and shareholders.\" The $3 per kilogram credit makes nuclear hydrogen highly competitive with fossil fuel produced hydrogen, Teplinsky said. The U.S. Department of Energy has as a goal, one of its Energy Earthshots Initiatives, to reduce the cost of clean hydrogen to $1 per kilogram in a decade. For many of these burgeoning use cases for clean hydrogen, the tax credit included in the climate bill is going to give companies the chance to enter the market for making clean hydrogen without losing money. \"They could go back to their shareholders, and they can say, 'Look, we can we can do this economically \u2014 today. We don't have to project a loss for the next five years to enter this market. We can actually enter this and have it be economic, or at least a breakeven project in the near future,'\" Teplinsky said. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed in November also included $8 billion to develop regional clean hydrogen hubs in the U.S. Between the two laws, the U.S. should be able to develop a clean hydrogen economy in seven to eight years, Teplinsky said."},

Revenue is growing for Disney's parks, experiences and products division and the company is seeing steady increases in attendance, occupied room nights and cruise ship sailings. During its most recent earnings, Disney touted that its new Genie+ and Lightning Lane products helped boost average per capita ticket revenue during the quarter. These new digital features were introduced to curate guest experience and allow parkgoers to bypass lines for major attractions. The company said it has been able to bring back in-park experiences such as character meet-and-greets, theatrical performances and nighttime events at Disneyland, which has allowed it to increase capacity at its parks, CEO Bob Chapek said at the time. Disney has placed caps on attendance since it reopened after the initial round of pandemic closures in early 2020 and instituted a new online reservation system to control crowds. The company continues to add new features and attractions to its theme parks and cruise lines, which Josh D'Amaro, head of Disney's parks, experiences and product division, outlined Sunday at its D23 Expo. D'Amaro welcomed Jon Favreau, executive producer of \"The Mandalorian,\" on stage to announce that the Mandalorian will appear with an animatronic Grogu in Galaxy's Edge as part of its in-land costumed characters available for meet-and-greets and interactions. He will arrive in November. Disney CEO Bob Chapek revealed on Friday that the California-based Disneyland would be getting a third attraction at its Avengers Campus. The ride is based on the multiverse and riders will battle against villains from different universes, including King Thanos. Head of Marvel Studios Kevin Feige appeared in person while Mark Ruffalo, who portrays the Hulk, appeared via video to reveal that Hulk will be in the park as a meet-and-greet opportunity. The version of Hulk was developed as part of Project Exo and will arrive in the park next week. Pacific Wharf at Disney California Adventure will be transformed into San Fransokyo from \"Big Hero Six,\" and including the chance to meet Baymax, the helpful health-care robot. Additionally, Paradise Pier Hotel is becoming Pixar Place Hotel. Downtown Disney will add several new restaurants including Porto's Bakery and Cafe and Din Tai Fung. Disneyland's Toon Town land will get a version of Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway attraction from Hollywood Studios in Orlando, Florida, as well as a number of cosmetic updates and a new play yard for kids. These updates are expected in 2023. Tiana's Bayou Adventure, which is replacing Splash Mountain, takes place directly after the events of \"The Princes and the Frog\" and follows Princess Tiana as she searches for a missing ingredient for a party celebrating Carnival. The ride is slated to reopen in late 2024. D'Amaro said that music will be a huge part of the ride and the cast from the movie will return to lend their voices to the attraction. Anika Noni Rose, the voice of Tiana, arrived on stage to sing \"I'm Almost There\" and \"Dig a Little Deeper\" from the 2009 animated film. D'Amaro announced that Disney is in the midst of creating a new night-time spectacular for Epcot to celebrate the company's 100th anniversary. Additionally, Journey of Water, inspired by \"Moana,\" which was announced back in 2019 will open in late 2023. Also coming to Epcot is Figment, the fan-favorite purple dragon, who will be returning to the park for meet-and-greets in the future. Additionally, next year the Hat Box Ghost will appear at the Haunted Mansion in Walt Disney World. D'Amaro showed footage of his test ride of Tron Light Cycle Run, noting that the ride is slated to open in spring 2023 at Magic Kingdom. Disney's sixth cruise ship is called \"Disney Treasure\" and celebrates Walt Disney's love of adventure. The grand hall is inspired by \"Aladdin\" and features a statue of Jasmine and Aladdin riding on the magic carpet. D'Amaro said the \"Disney Wonder\" will now travel to Australia and New Zealand starting Oct. 2023. The company is also opening a new island vacation spot located in the Bahamas called Lighthouse Point. D'Amaro said 90% of the power used at this location will be provided by solar power. Duffy and Friends, cute cuddly characters from Shanghai Disney Resort, will be getting their own stop-motion series on Disney+. D'Amaro also showed new images from the Zootopia land, which will feature a large animatronic of Officer Clawhauser. No date has been set for the land's official opening. Hong Kong Disneyland is getting a new Walt Disney statue, which is inspired by Walt watching his children ride on a merry-go-round and inspiring the launch of Disney's theme parks. The park's Frozen-themed land will open in the second half of 2023. In Paris, a new promenade will be added to attach its new Frozen-inspired land to the rest of the park and a \"Tangled\" themed attraction will be added to the new garden area. Tokyo Disney Resort is also in the midst of adding a new land to its park based on \"Frozen,\" \"Tangled\" and \"Peter Pan\" called Fantasy Springs. Space Mountain at Tokyo Disneyland will undergo a transformation in 2024 and have a new plaza that will be complete in 2027. At the end of the panel, D'Amaro discussed what he called \"blue sky\" projects that the Imagineering team is working on. There are projects that are still in early development and may ultimately not see the light of day. D'Amaro talked about the possibility of revamping Dino Land at Animal Kingdom in Orlando, Florida. Initial ideas for the space include the possibility of bringing \"Zootopia\" to the park, including its variety of districts and animal species, or even \"Moana.\" At Magic Kingdom, Disney is asking the question: \"What is behind Big Thunder Mountain?\" The company teased that an area based on \"Coco\" could be in that location or \"Encanto.\" Perhaps, both. D'Amaro even teased the possibility of also bringing to life an area of Magic Kingdom overrun by Disney villains. The crowd erupted with applause at this suggestion. For the most part, villains make their appearances during Disney's Halloween special events. \"We are never going to stop delighting you,\" he said."},

Here's what's happening now \u2013 and what could happen next", "paragraphs": " The slowdown in the otherwise red-hot housing boom has been stunningly swift. The U.S. housing market surged during the pandemic as homebound people sought new places to live, boosted by record-low interest rates. Now, real estate agents who once reported lines of buyers outside open houses and bidding wars on the back deck say homes are sitting longer and sellers are being forced to lower their sights. That has both potential buyers and sellers wondering where they stand. \"As recession concerns weigh on consumer outlooks, our survey shows uncertainty has made its way into the minds of many buyers,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. Here are the major factors behind the topsy-turvy housing market. The main driver of the slowdown is rising mortgage rates. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage, which is by far the most popular product today, accounting for more than 90% of all mortgage applications, started this year right around 3%. It is now just above 6%, according to Mortgage News Daily. That means a person buying a $400,000 home would have a monthly payment about $700 higher now than it would have been in January. The other drivers of the slowdown are high prices and low supply. Prices are now 43% higher than they were at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to the S&P Case-Shiller national home price index. The supply of homes for sale is growing, up 27% at the start of September compared with the same time a year ago, according to Realtor.com. While that comparison seems large, it's still not enough to offset the years-long shortage of homes for sale. Active inventory is still 43% lower than it was in 2019. New listings were also down 6% at the end of September, meaning potential sellers are now concerned as they see more houses sit on the market longer. Paul Legere is a buyer's agent with Joel Nelson Group in Washington, D.C. He focuses on the competitive Capitol Hill neighborhood, and he said he saw listings jump by 20 to 171 just after Labor Day. He now calls the market \"bloated.\" As a comparison, just 65 homes were listed for sale in March. \"This is a very traditional post Labor Day inventory bump and seeing in a week or so how the market absorbs the new inventory is going to be very telling,\" he said. \"Very.\" Inventory is taking a hit nationally because homebuilders are slowing production due to fewer potential buyers touring their models. Housing starts for single-family homes dropped 18.5% in July compared with July 2021, according to the U.S. Census. Homebuilder sentiment in the single-family market fell into negative territory in August for the first time since a brief dip at the start of the pandemic, according to the National Association of Home Builders. Builders reported lower sales and weaker buyer traffic. \"Tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve and persistently elevated construction costs have brought on a housing recession,\" said NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz in the August report. Buyers, however, have not disappeared entirely, despite the still-pricey for-sale market and the equally expensive rental market. \"Data indicates that some home shoppers are finding silver linings in the form of cooling competition for rising numbers of for-sale home option,\" said Realtor.com's Hale. \"Especially for buyers who are getting creative, such as by exploring smaller markets, this fall could bring relatively better chances to find a home within budget.\" Home prices are finally starting to cool off. They declined 0.77% from June to July, the first monthly fall in nearly three years, according to Black Knight, a mortgage technology and data provider. While the drop may seem small, it is the largest single-month decline in prices since January 2011. It is also the second-worst July performance dating back to 1991, behind the 0.9% decline in July 2010, during the Great Recession. Still, that drop in prices will do very little to improve the affordability crisis brought on by rising mortgage rates. While rates fell back slightly in August, they have risen sharply again this week, making for the least affordable week in housing in 35 years. It currently takes 35.51% of median income to make the monthly principal and interest payment on the median home with a 30-year mortgage and 20% down. That's up marginally from the prior 35-year high back in June, when the payment-to-income ratio reached 35.49%, according to Andy Walden, vice president of enterprise research and strategy at Black Knight. In the five years before interest rates began to rise, that income-to-payment ratio held steady around 20%. Even though home prices surged in the 2020 and 2021, record-low interest rates offset the increases. \"Given the large role affordability challenges appear to be playing in shifting housing market dynamics, the recent pullback in home prices is likely to continue,\" Walden said. A new report from real estate brokerage Redfin showed that while homebuyer demand woke up a bit in August, the latest increase in mortgage rates over the past week put it right back to sleep. Fewer people searched for \"homes for sale\" on Google with searches during the week ending Sept. 3 \u2013 down 25% from a year earlier, according to the report. Redfin's demand index, which measures requests for home tours and other home-buying services from Redfin agents, showed that during the seven days ending Sept. 4, demand was up 18% from the 2022 low in June, but still down 11% year over year. \"The housing market always cools down this time of year,\" said Daryl Fairweather, Redfin's chief economist, \"but this year I expect fall and winter to be especially frigid as sales dry up more than usual.\""},

Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige teased that his team has a plan for the next ten years of Marvel's cinematic universe, and plans to incorporate the Fantastic Four, X-Men and Deadpool into the mix of already established Marvel heroes. Here's a breakdown of what audiences can expect from Disney's Marvel Studios in the coming years: Kevin Feige, head of Marvel Studios, started his portion of the D23 Expo panel with a rendition of \"I Can Do This All Day\" from \"Rogers: The Musical,\" which appeared in the Disney+ series \"Hawkeye.\" Ryan Coogler, the director of \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,\" brought footage from the film, which is due out in theaters Nov. 11. The clips showed Queen Ramonda chastising the United Nations for trying to steal vibranium from Wakanda following the death of T'Challa. The footage showcased the power of the Dora Milaje and set the stage for an epic fight against Namor and the Atlanteans. \"Excited for you to walk out of the cinema and feel proud of what we brought to you,\" said Letitia Wright, who portrays Shuri in the film. Audiences got a quick glimpse at Riri Williams in the \"Wakanda Forever\" footage, but Marvel also shared a peek at the \"Ironheart\" Disney+ series, which is still in production. The clips showed Riri building bits of the Ironheart armor and Feige teased that the show will focus on the cross section of magic and technology. Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly and Johnathan Majors appeared on stage to discuss the upcoming \"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,\" the first film in phase 5 of the MCU. \"This thing is bananas,\" Rudd said. \"This is going to be unlike anything you've seen from us and not to mention that guy,\" he said, pointing to Majors, who portrays Kang. \"Throws this whole thing into such new territory.\" Footage shows the Lang, Van Dyne and Pym families being pulled into the quantum realm and faced with a terrible new foe: Kang the Conqueror. Gael Garcia Bernal and Laura Donnelly star in \"Werewolf by Night,\" special Marvel Studios presentation coming to Disney+ in October. The film, which is shot entirely black and white, harkens back to \"The Twilight Zone\" and old monster movies of the '30s and '40s. Early footage shown at D23 Expo suggests the film follows a group of monster hunters seeking out a monster among them. \"Secret Invasion\" follows a faction of shapeshifting aliens known as Skrulls who have infiltrated all aspects of life on Earth. The Skrulls first appeared in 2018's \"Captain Marvel,\" which was set in the '90s. Don Cheadle arrived to share footage from the upcoming Disney+ series filled with political intrigue and action. He also teased \"Armor Wars,\" a show that will begin shooting next year. Feige brought on the cast of \"Loki' to showcase a teaser trailer from the second season, which promises even more mischief. He announced Matt Shakman, the director of \"WandaVision,\" will officially direct the MCU's \"Fantastic Four\" feature film. \"Echo,\" a new Disney+ show that centers on a deaf female heroine, takes place after \"Hawkeye\" and features heavy use of American Sign Language. Footage from the series shows the return of Vincent D'Onofrio as King Pin. Alaqua Cox reprises her role as the title character. D'Onofrio, who had been on stage to promote \"Echo,\" was joined by Charlie Cox to share footage of Matthew Murdock aka Daredevil in \"She-Hulk.' No footage was shown from the show, as it has not begun filming. D'Onofrio will appear in the series. Anthony Mackie returns as Captain America in \"Captain America: New World Order.\" He was joined on stage by Danny Ramiez, who plays Joaquin Torres, Carl Lumbly as Isaiah Bradley and Tim Blacke Nelson as Samuel Sterns, aka the Leader. Feige announced the team that will be part of \"Thunderbolts.\" This includes Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, David Harbour as Red Guardian, Hannah John-Kamen as Ghost, Olga Kurylenko as Task Master, Wyatt Russel as John Walker aka U.S. Agent, Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova and Sebastian Stan as the Winter Soldier. \"It tells you all you need to know about the Thunderbolts when the beloved Winter Soldier is the most table among them,\" Feige teased. Brie Larson, Iman Vellani and Teyonah Parris closed out the panel with footage from the upcoming film. Miss Marvel, Captain Monica Rambeau and Captain Marvel find their powers have become intertwined and the three heroes must become untangled. In the mean time, the three continue to accidentally swap places, leading to quite a few laughs. The footage shown at the D23 Expo was action-packed and filled with comedic beats. Also, everyone's favorite Flerkin, Goose, will be back for more antics."},

Terms of the deal weren't disclosed. Amazon began working with Cloostermans in 2019, using its technology to help move and stack heavy palettes and goods, as well as package products together for delivery, the retail giant said. Cloostermans will become part of Amazon Robotics, Amazon's division focused on automating aspects of its warehouse operations. The unit was formed after Amazon acquired Kiva Systems, a manufacturer of warehouse robots, for $775 million a decade ago. Amazon continues to launch new machines in warehouses. In June, the company unveiled a package ferrying machine called Proteus, which it referred to as its first fully autonomous mobile robot. It's also deployed other robots that can help sort and move packages. In a blog post, Ian Simpson, vice president of Global Robotics at Amazon, said the company is investing in robotics and other technology to make its warehouses safer for employees. \"As we continue to broaden and accelerate the robotics and technology we design, engineer and deploy across our operations, we look forward to welcoming Cloostermans to Amazon and are excited to see what we can build together,\" Simpson said. The prospect of warehouse robotics improving safety has been a topic of debate. An investigation by Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting found Amazon's warehouses with robots have higher injury rates than facilities without automation. Founded in 1884, Cloostermans began as a repair shop for textile companies and went on to build industrial machines. As a result of the acquisition, Cloostermans' team of roughly 200 employees will join Amazon Robotics, Amazon said. WATCH: Inside Rivian's deal with Amazon"},

Amazon said 159 employees will be laid off from Amazon Care, based on Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) filings submitted late Thursday. The WARN Act requires employers to provide advance notice, generally within 60 days, of mass layoffs or plant closings. Another 236 employees will be let go from Care Medical, a team of clinicians that was charged with treating Amazon Care patients, according to a separate WARN notice also filed Thursday. Care Medical is an independent company that was contracted to work with Amazon. The layoffs are slated to begin Dec. 1, according to the filings. Amazon said late last month that it will wind down its telehealth service after Dec. 31. The company chose to shutter the service after determining it wasn't \"a complete enough offering\" for customers, Amazon said. Amazon Care was one piece of Amazon's strategy to upend the health-care industry, alongside its pharmacy and consumer diagnostics ventures. Even after shuttering Amazon Care, the company has continued its expansion into health care. In July, Amazon said it would acquire One Medical for $3.9 billion, bringing in a network of boutique primary care clinics. Amazon Care launched in 2019 as a pilot program for employees in and around the company's Seattle headquarters, before expanding to serve other employers. The service provides virtual urgent care visits, as well as free telehealth consults and in-home visits for a fee from nurses for testing and vaccinations. At the time that Amazon announced it would shutter the service, the company said in a memo to employees that it would give them the opportunity to find roles elsewhere at Amazon. \"Many Care employees will have an opportunity to join other parts of the Health Services organization or other teams at Amazon \u2014 which we'll be discussing with many of you shortly \u2014 and we'll also support employees looking for roles outside of the company,\" Amazon Health Services lead Neil Lindsay wrote in the memo. An Amazon representative reiterated in an emailed statement that those affected will have the opportunity to find other jobs internally. \"Our priority continues to be supporting our employees during this transition,\" the statement said. In the second quarter, Amazon shaved its headcount by 99,000 people to 1.52 million employees. The retail giant is taking steps to shrink its workforce as it looks to cut costs after growing its staff and warehouse footprint at an unprecedent pace during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The world's largest cryptocurrency was last trading 10% higher at $21,268.25, after falling below $19,000 earlier in this week and to its lowest level since mid-June. Other digital coins were higher including ether which was up around 5%. The total cryptocurrency market value jumped back above $1 trillion again. The latest leg higher for bitcoin has been sparked by a slight weakening of the U.S. dollar which has seen a stunning rally this year. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of other currencies, was down about 1% on Friday morning. U.S. stock indexes closed higher on Thursday and futures were higher Friday. Bitcoin has been closely correlated to U.S. markets often rising when stock indexes do. Bitcoin also tends to rise when the dollar weakens. Bitcoin has been trading in a range of around $18,000 to $24,000 since June and has not been able to break that pattern. Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, said that Friday's rally could be a \"bearish retest\" of the $22,500 to $23,000 price. \"Hence unless it breaks that level convincingly and closes above, I would still think this is a bearish rally that could see more ranging and downside,\" Ayyar said. Bitcoin has been battered this year and is more than 60% off its record high seen in November as the Federal Reserve has hiked interest rates aggressively taking the shine of risk assets such as cryptocurrencies. The crypto market has also been hit by failed projects and high-profile bankruptcies which have spread across the industry. Crypto markets have been anticipating a major network upgrade to Ethereum called the merge, which proponents say will make the blockchain more efficient. The merge is expected to be completed by mid-September. In the run-up to the event, the price of ether, the native token of Ethereum, has far outpaced bitcoin. Financial markets are also looking for signs of cooling inflation when the U.S. Consumer Price Index is reported next week. And investors are also keeping an eye on signals about the Fed's rate hike path. On Thursday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he is \"strongly committed\" to fighting inflation, suggesting further rate raises could be coming. If inflation cools and with anticipation around the Ethereum merge, Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese crypto exchange Bitbank, said bitcoin could test the $22,000 level, but also offered a warning. \"Given what some Fed members, including chair Powell, said this week, too much optimism could be dangerous,\" Hasegawa said in a note on Friday."},
{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/09/roblox-jumping-into-ads-in-effort-to-diversify-beyond-virtual-goods-.html", "title": "Roblox jumps into online advertising as revenue growth slows", "paragraphs": " Roblox has built a userbase of over 52 million people by providing a gaming and entertainment platform that's mostly been targeted at kids. Now the company wants advertisers to join the party. As part of its annual developer conference on Friday, Roblox is announcing plans to debut ads next year, marking the company's first significant effort to diversify its business beyond virtual goods in games. Prior to the rollout, Roblox said it will be testing ads with unspecified developers and brands by the end of this year. Manuel Bronstein, Roblox's chief product officer, said the company has already tried out some online ads with brands like Warner Bros. and Vans. The ads were displayed in an experimental ad format that Roblox referred to as \"portals,\" he said. He also said the company remains committed to its core business, which allows gamers to spend real money on the virtual currency Robux that can be used to level up and buy items in games. \"We have an amazing transactional economy, and we will continue to invest in it,\" Bronstein said. He characterized the company's push into online ads as a \"good strategic bet\" that's \"early\" in its development. Roblox debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in March 2021, and saw its market cap swell past $80 billion in November, as investors poured into high-growth tech stocks. But this year's economic slowdown has punished those businesses, with Roblox losing 60% of its value in 2022. In August, Roblox reported second-quarter financials that missed on both the top and bottom lines, and revenue growth slowed to 30% from more than 100% a year earlier. The company said in its quarterly filing that it generates \"substantially all of our revenue\" from the sale of Robux. Roblox CEO David Baszucki told CNBC in February that the company has \"many opportunities to increase monetization\" and he cited advertising and 3D immersive shopping as potential areas for growth. To date, the company has focused on \"creating a safe and civil platform\" and growing its daily active user base, Baszucki said. Roblox describes its upcoming ad offering as immersive ads, though there's not yet a standard format for how they will appear. Bronstein speculated that future ads in the metaverse \u2014 an online world where people socialize, work and learn \u2014 could resemble digital billboards that people can use to buy goods like shoes, or even branded digital coffee cups. In the portal ad tests, when users interact with the brand, they can be automatically transported to the company's virtual Roblox community, Bronstein said. At this stage, companies are just trying to understand how ads can function in Roblox and other metaverses. Regarding Warner Bros. and its recent Roblox test, Bronstein said \"they were fascinated by the results.\" Roblox is jumping into online ads during a period of turbulence in the market. Meta's Facebook business and Snap have been particularly hurt by Apple's privacy changes in iOS, which make targeting more difficult. The economic slowdown has led a number of companies to pull back on ad spending, and TikTok's emergence has added a new avenue to the mix. Meanwhile, Amazon and Apple are bolstering their ad businesses, as companies that rely on those platforms are spending more money to get in front of consumers. With that backdrop, Roblox will have to prove its value before brands will open their wallets in any meaningful way. Businesses could use their metaverse ads \"as connections with the real world,\" Bronstein said. For instance, a company's branded digital item could function like \"a coupon to go buy something at a store\" in the physical world. Roblox faces the additional challenge of serving ads on an app that's predominantly used by kids. All Roblox ads will be labeled as \"immersive ads\" and children under the age of 13 will not be able to interact with them, the company said. The company is also adding more guidelines to let parents and children know which virtual experiences are suited for certain age groups based on criteria like violence. In addition to ads, Roblox is debuting other new features, including a tool to help users more easily discover virtual worlds and experiences that may be of interest to them, as well as chatting features, more immersive avatars that include facial animations and other tools for creators. In the second quarter, Roblox's daily active user count climbed 21% from a year earlier to 52.2 million. WATCH: Metaverse faces hardware headwinds for VR future"},

Former Vice President of Gigafactory Operations, Chris Lister, left Elon Musk's electric vehicle and clean energy business this summer, and Hrushikesh \"Hrushi\" Sagar was promoted to oversee the Gigafactory, according to audio of a Thursday meeting and documents shared with CNBC by people who work at the factory. Sagar reports directly to CEO Elon Musk and will also be overseeing Tesla's vehicle assembly plant in Fremont, California, simultaneously. Sagar spoke to a group of hundreds of Gigafactory employees on Thursday afternoon about management changes, performance reviews, factory milestones, and aggressive new goals for the facility. He also disclosed some information about progress in Tesla's factories in Austin, Texas, and outside of Berlin, Germany. Sagar briefly addressed Lister's departure saying, \"I really appreciate what Chris Lister did here, Chris's contribution. I'm very thankful, like Elon, and Tesla is very thankful, for his contribution, but at the same time now we are moving on to the next phase.\" Workers at the Gigafactory manufacture battery packs and power trains for Tesla's electric vehicles, as well as the big backup batteries, Powerwall and Megapack, sold by Tesla's Energy division. During the meeting, Sagar celebrated the fact that Tesla made around 134,000 cars in its Fremont, Calif., factory in the second quarter of 2022, and said that August was one of the record months for Fremont in terms of production. The Fremont factory is now able to make around 12,000 cars per week and is aiming for 14,000 per week as its next goal, he said. He also said that Tesla's team in Brandenburg, Germany, recently hit a milestone of being able to produce 1,000 cars on a rolling seven-day basis. Musk recently visited the German factory and the company expects it to ramp production to make 5,000 cars per week by the end of 2022. Initially, Reno was sending drive units to Germany to aid in that effort. Tesla's new factory in Austin, Texas also hit the 1,000-per-week production rate. In terms of drive unit production, the Gigafactory produced 283,473 power trains in the second quarter of 2022 \"feeding\" the company's Fremont and Austin factories. \"You all played a very big role,\" Sagar said. \"I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart,\" to the Reno team. Before he joined Tesla in late 2017, Chris Lister spent 22 years in precision manufacturing roles at PepsiCo. During his tenure at Tesla, the Gigafactory experienced a rapid build-out and growing pains including high volumes of scrap, fires and oil spills. But in ramping up production there, he also helped propel Tesla to become the top-selling battery electric vehicle brand in the U.S. and world. Lister and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Sagar's new title, according to his LinkedIn profile, is senior director of vehicle operations and manufacturing engineering. Sagar told employees on Thursday that they should think of the Fremont factory as their \"customer,\" noting that vehicle production there succeeds or is hampered depending on Gigafactory shipping volumes and quality. While Sagar does not plan to spend most of his time in Reno, he plans to work closely with leaders at the plant, including Energy Leader Matt Reddick, who joined the company about six months ago, and Site Leader Eric Montgomery, who will manage things day-to-day in Nevada. Other top leaders at the Gigafactory now include Jeff Jackson, who is heading up infrastructure for the facility, and Bert Somsin, a human resources director for the plant. At the same meeting on Thursday, Montgomery told Gigafactory employees that they need to get to a steady output of 8,800 high voltage battery packs per week to support Fremont's new production goals, and \"maximize all-wheel-drive builds.\" He said August 2022 was also the Gigafactory's second-best month on record for production, second only to October 2021. Reddick said Tesla can now produce 42 giant Megapack batteries in a seven-day rolling period. Megapacks are about the size of a shipping container and are used for utility-scale energy storage, often to store excess energy generated by wind or solar. Tesla is on target to produce 442 Megapacks during the third quarter of 2022, representing an 85% growth over Megapack production in the previous three-month period. The Gigafactory also hit and has exceeded a production rate of 6,500 Powerwalls per week. Powerwalls are the smaller backup batteries for home use that CEO Elon Musk recently promoted on Twitter amid a massive heatwave in California. The heat wave threatened blackouts, and had the state urging residents to reduce their power consumption during peak hours. Tesla previously required customers who wanted to buy a Powerwall also to buy a solar roof from the company. The Nevada Gigafactory made 37,600 Powerwalls in the second quarter, Montgomery said, and said the facility is on target to increase that by 22% in the third quarter. In terms of the facility itself, Jackson touted a new, advanced water treatment facility that Tesla is building on site. \"This is to going to eliminate the discharge of our site process water, or wastewater, and it's going to allow for 98% water recycling and evaporation,\" he said. \"It's a huge thing, it's aligned with our mission.\" Jackson also gave an update on the Gigafactory's solar roof. \"Right now we've got about eight megawatts on the roof that we're able to use on a daily basis, which is really exciting,\" the infrastructure leader said. Tesla also has a new food vendor on site that provides poke bowls, is building a meditation room for employees, and is making road improvements and installing more EV chargers along the roads around the facility. On the human resources front, workers were urged to reduce the number of labor hours it takes to produce a single unit of the products they build in their teams, and to file more \"take charge\" notices about how to improve safety and reduce costs around the plant. The company is moving past steep headcount cuts that took place in the second-quarter this year, and is in the midst of an extensive, performance review process, Sagar said. One employee asked management if their equity grants would be tied to company milestones this year, and management said no. But human resources teams and managers are still figuring out who may be eligible for promotions, raises and bonuses. Sagar said by the end of September, managers should be speaking with their teams about their performance assessments. Employees asked management to discuss whether and where Tesla's next factory may be built. Lobbying activity by Tesla in Canada, and the company's investments up North previously have stirred speculation of a Canada-based plant. Sagar said, \"I have some idea on the candidates but I don't think I'm at liberty right now to disclose those candidates because of the confidentiality around some of those things.\" He did offer, \"There is an exciting future for North America and all around the Americas.\""},

Tesla said the plant would be focused on the development of \"battery-grade lithium hydroxide\" and be \"the first of its kind in North America,\" according to a newly released letter to the Texas Comptroller's Office. The company would process \"raw ore material into a usable state for battery production\" then ship the lithium hydroxide to various Tesla battery manufacturing factories, the application said. In April, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company may need to get into lithium refining because the cost of the metal had \"gone to insane levels.\" The price of lithium is up 120% this year, according to an tracking index from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. Tesla's move is also likely a bid to diversify the supply of its lithium and battery production. China controls more than half of the world's lithium processing and refining, and the United States just 1%. As part of the application to Texas, the company said it is also considering \"other battery materials processing, refining and manufacturing and ancillary manufacturing operations in support of Tesla's sustainable product line.\" If Tesla's application is approved, construction could begin in the fourth quarter of 2022, the company said. The project will reach \"commercial operations\" by the fourth quarter of 2024. Tesla said that it is still \"evaluating the feasibility of this project\" and \"only very preliminary development activities have begun.\" No engineering, construction or procurement construction contracts have been negotiated or signed and no regulatory permits have been obtained, Tesla said. Musk's firm said the project could be located \"anywhere with access to the Gulf Coast shipping channel.\" Tesla said it is evaluating a competing site in Louisiana. Tesla said the only way this project will be viable is if Texas gives it tax breaks under its law. \"In the case of the investment on this proposed project in Texas, the decision will be based on a number of commercial and financial considerations, including the ability to obtain relief regarding local property taxes,\" according to the application. Lithium is a critical metal for batteries that go into everything from electric cars from smartphones. Given the strategic importance of such rare earth metals and China's mining dominance of them, there has been concern from Washington that Beijing could cut off critical supplies of lithium and other materials. The U.S. is looking to ramp up its own rare earth refining and mining industry to catch up with China. Here's the letter:"},

The streamer's historic Oscar win for Best Picture was overshadowed by an altercation between actor Will Smith and comedian Chris Rock in March, but big wins at Monday's Emmys could cement the service as one of the most reputable content providers in the streaming space. \"Apple TV+ follows a 'less is more' strategy,\" said Peter Csathy, founder and chairman of advisory firm Creative Media. \"Fewer titles but bigger names and premium quality.\" In recent years, Csathy noted that Apple TV+ has built a small but critically acclaimed catalog that is \"almost becoming the new HBO,\" which was known for quality series prior to its merger with HBO Max. Apple TV+, which has been around for less than three years, has earned 52 total Emmy nominations across 13 different titles in 2022. HBO and HBO Max notched 140 nominations combined and Netflix received 104. Apple TV+'s breakout hit \"Ted Lasso\" is up again for Outstanding Comedy Series, while its new show \"Severance\" is on the ballot for Outstanding Drama Series. Competition in both categories is steep, in part because of new entrants like \"Squid Game,\" \"Yellow Jackets\" and \"Abbot Elementary.\" This is also the last year of eligibility for \"Better Call Saul\" and \"Ozark.\" Earlier this year, Apple TV+ won the Best Picture award at the Oscars for \"CODA,\" marking the first time a streaming platform got the top prize. Troy Kotsur, who starred in the film, also became the first deaf man to win an Oscar for acting. Already, streaming services have used the prestige associated with Hollywood nominations or awards to encourage subscriber sign-ups or sign top talent. Over the past decade, Emmy awards for shows like \"Orange Is the New Black\" and \"The Crown\" have burnished the reputation of Netflix, enabling the service to bring on top talent like Ryan Murphy, Shonda Rhimes and Guillermo del Toro. Such prestige is even more critical for Apple, which has long partnered with the biggest names in music and Hollywood for its cachet. That's because the primary goal for Apple TV+ is to sell Apple products \u2014 not to garner hundreds of millions of subscribers. \"Apple has always used content as marketing for its products,\" said Csathy. \"For Apple, the streaming service is just the means to the end \u2014 and the end is more sales of iPhones, Macs, Apple TVs, etc. As long as Apple TV+ screams quality, then it serves its purpose in Apple's overall engine.\" Though streaming services generally provide limited metrics, Apple has been particularly quiet since it launched its streaming video platform in November 2019. Unlike many others in the space, the company does not disclose data about financial performance, content spending or subscriber numbers for individual shows or the service as a whole. (Even \"Severance\" executive producer Ben Stiller has expressed frustration about Apple's vague statistics.)\nWhen Apple CEO Tim Cook is asked about the service, he usually points to nominations and awards, suggesting that's the metric Apple is using to judge its success.\n\"In two and a half years since launch, Apple TV+ has now earned 250 wins and over 1,100 award nominations and counting,\" Cook told analysts on an earnings call in July. In June, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi estimated that the service has between 20 million and 40 million subscribers and that is generates around $1 billion to $2 billion in annual revenue. That would be a drop in the bucket compared to the company's overall balance sheet, which tallied $366 billion during fiscal 2021. Apple TV+'s spending on content is estimated to pale in comparison to rival streamers. Netflix is expected to spend around $17 billion on content this year and Disney about $32 billion spread across its media divisions. By contrast, Bernstein suggests Apple spends just north of $3 billion, while Rayburn estimates the number to be closer to between $1 billion and $2 billion. Those projections would suggest that the service could be losing money. Dan Rayburn, a media and streaming analyst, noted that there's no clear data showing Hollywood recognition translates to increased subscribers. But for Apple, he noted that calculation really doesn't matter. \"If Apple TV+ gets 10 million subs, or they get 20 million subs, does it move the needle from a revenue standpoint? No.\" said Rayburn. \"They don't even have to disclose to Wall Street because it's not a material impact on the company.\" \u2014 CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report."},

In a report published Thursday, the CDC found that 38% of nearly 2,000 people diagnosed with monkeypox between May and July were living with HIV. Among 1,300 monkeypox patients with more detailed clinical data, 8% of HIV-positive individuals were hospitalized compared with 3% of people without HIV infection. The CDC found that HIV-positive individuals in particular with low T-cell counts, which indicates a weaker immune system, and in whom the virus is not suppressed are hospitalized more frequently with monkeypox. But data on the reason for hospitalization is incomplete so it's unknown whether HIV-positive people hospitalized with monkeypox are suffering from more severe disease, according to the CDC. People living with HIV in previous monkeypox outbreaks in Nigeria did have poor outcomes. Monkeypox is primarily spreading during sex among gay and bisexual men, though anyone can catch the virus through close physical contact with someone who is infected or contaminated materials such as towels and bedsheets. Men who have sex with men have HIV infections more often than the general population, according to the CDC. But the 38% of monkeypox patients who also have HIV is far higher than than the rate observed among the broader population of gay and bisexual men, the study found. The percentage of monkeypox patients who have HIV has also increased over time, which suggests monkeypox may be spreading more in networks of people who have HIV, according to the agency. The CDC found a major racial disparity among people who have HIV and monkeypox. Black and Hispanic patients had monkeypox and HIV at a far higher rate \u2013 63%, and 41% \u2013 respectively, than white patients at 28%. Monkeypox is disproportionately impacting Black and Hispanic populations. Nearly 38% of monkeypox patients are Black, 29% are Hispanic and 27% are white, according to CDC data. The overall U.S. population is 12% Black, 19% Hispanic and 61% White, according to data from the 2020 Census. People with HIV who also have monkeypox are reporting some symptoms more often such as rectal pain and proctitis. Monkeypox causes a rash, which resembles pimples or blisters, that often develops on sensitive areas such as the anus or genitals. The CDC officials who authored the study said vaccination against monkeypox should be prioritized for people who are HIV-positive and who have other sexually transmitted infections. People evaluated for monkeypox should also undergo HIV and STI screening, the authors said. Some 41% of monkeypox patients were diagnosed with one or more STIs over the past year, according to the CDC study. Health-care providers should also offer patients medication such as PrEP, which helps lower the risk of getting HIV through sex. The CDC has estimated that 1.6 million gay and bisexual men who are HIV-positive or who are taking medication to reduce their risk of HIV face the highest threat from monkeypox. More than 460,000 monkeypox vaccine doses have been administered so far. Department of Health and Human Services officials have said the U.S. is approaching the point where there are enough doses available to fully vaccinate the highest-risk population. The U.S. is battling the largest monkeypox outbreak in the world, with more than 21,000 cases reported across all 50 states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico, according to CDC data. White House health officials said Wednesday that the outbreak appears to be slowing as vaccinations ramp up, though the racial disparity in people diagnosed with monkeypox is growing."},

Griffin is barred for life from holding any federal or state office \u2014 including his current role as county commissioner, from which he will be ousted \"effective immediately,\" Judge Francis Mathew ruled. Griffin became \"constitutionally disqualified\" from those positions as of Jan. 6, 2021, the judge concluded. On that day, a violent mob of former President Donald Trump 's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, forcing lawmakers to flee their chambers and disrupting the transfer of power to President Joe Biden. Griffin was convicted in March on a misdemeanor charge of breaching restricted Capitol grounds. The riot and the planning and incitement that led up to it \"constituted an 'insurrection'\" under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, Mathew wrote in the ruling in New Mexico's 1st Judicial District Court. The ruling marked the first time that any court found that the Capitol riot met the definition of an insurrection, according to the nonprofit government watchdog group CREW, which represented the plaintiffs who filed the lawsuit to disqualify Griffin. \"This decision makes clear that any current or former public officials who took an oath to defend the U.S. Constitution and then participated in the January 6th insurrection can and will be removed and barred from government service for their actions,\" CREW President Noah Bookbinder said in a press release. Griffin told CNN later Tuesday that he had been ordered to clean out his desk. \"I'm shocked, just shocked,\" Griffin told CNN. \"I really did not feel like the state was going to move on me in such a way. I don't know where I go from here.\" Mathew's ruling also marks the first time since 1869 that a court has disqualified a public official under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, according to CREW. That section, known as the Disqualification Clause, bars any person from holding civil or military office at the federal or state level of the United States if they \"have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.\" Griffin did not enter the Capitol building itself or commit violence during the Jan. 6 riot, but he nevertheless engaged in it and his actions \"aided the insurrection,\" Mathew ruled. \"By joining the mob and trespassing on restricted Capitol grounds, Mr. Griffin contributed to delaying Congress' election-certification proceedings,\" the judge wrote. Griffin's presence \"contributed to law enforcement being overwhelmed,\" and he also \"incited, encouraged, and helped normalize the violence\" during the riot, Mathew ruled. In addition, the judge dismissed as \"meritless\" the arguments put forward by Griffin, who represented himself in the case. Griffin's attempts to \"sanitize his actions are without merit and contrary to the evidence produced by the Plaintiffs, bearing in mind that he produced no evidence himself in his own defense,\" Mathew wrote. His arguments in court were \"not credible and amounted to nothing more than attempting to put lipstick on a pig,\" the judge added. Griffin was arrested less than two weeks after the Capitol riot. He was convicted in March and sentenced on June 17 to two weeks' time served in jail, along with a $3,000 fine and community service. Griffin, a Republican and a vocal supporter of Trump, has echoed the former president's false claims that the 2020 election results were compromised by widespread fraud. He and the two other GOP members who make up the Otero County Commission refused to certify its most recent primary election results, reportedly citing conspiracy theories about Dominion voting machines. The commission eventually voted 2 to 1 to certify the primary results, with Griffin voting \"no.\" In 2019, Griffin created Cowboys for Trump, a group that put on pro-Trump horseback-riding parades. Bookbinder called Tuesday's ruling \"a historic win for accountability for the January 6th insurrection and the efforts to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power in the United States.\" \"Protecting American democracy means ensuring those who violate their oaths to the Constitution are held responsible,\" he said."},

But unions built the middle class.\" Later Monday, he was flying to Pittsburgh for the city's parade \u2014 returning to Pennsylvania for the third time in less than a week and just two days after his predecessor, Donald Trump, staged his own rally in the state. The unofficial start of fall, Labor Day also traditionally starts a political busy season where campaigns scramble to excite voters for Election Day on Nov. 8. That's when control of the House and Senate, as well some of the country's top governorships, will be decided. Trump spoke Saturday night in Wilkes-Barre, near Scranton, where Biden was born. The president made his own Wilkes-Barre trip last week to discuss increasing funding for police, decry GOP criticism of the FBI after the raid on Trump's Florida estate and to argue that new, bipartisan gun measures can help reduce violent crime. Two days after that, Biden went to Independence Hall in Philadelphia for a prime-time address denouncing the \"extremism\" of Trump's fiercest supporters. Trump has endorsed candidates in key races around the country and Biden is warning that some Republicans now believe so strongly in Trumpism that they are willing to undermine core American values to promote it. The president said Thursday that \"blind loyalty to a single leader, and a willingness to engage in political violence, is fatal to democracy.\" Trump responded during his Saturday rally that Biden is \"an enemy of the state.\" On Monday, Biden said \"I'm not talking about all Republicans\" but singled out those who have taken Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" campaign cry to dangerous or hateful lengths. He highlighted episodes like last year's mob attack on the U.S. Capitol. Biden told the Milwaukee rally that many in the GOP have \"chosen to go backwards, full of anger, violence, hate, division.\" \"But together we can, and we must, choose a different path forward,\" Biden said. \"A future of unity and hope. we're going to choose to build a better America.\" The crowd jeered as Biden chided Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin for voting against a Democratic-backed measure meant to lower prescription drug prices. The president also returned to another theme that was a centerpiece of his 2020 campaign, that labor unions boosted the middle class. Unions endorsements helped Biden overcome disastrous early finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire to win the Democratic primary, and eventually the White House. He has since continued to praise labor unions \u2014 even though many voters without college degrees remain among Trump's strongest bloc of supporters. Mary Kay Henry, president of the 2-million-member Service Employees International Union, called Biden's championing of unions heading into the midterms \"critical\" and said the labor movement must \"mobilize in battlegrounds across the country to ensure that working people turn out.\" \"We're really excited about the president speaking directly to workers about, if he had the opportunity, he'd join a union,\" Henry said. She added: \"This president has signaled which side he's on. And he's on the side of working people. And that matters hugely.\" Biden, meanwhile, has personal history with Pittsburgh's Labor Day parade, which is among the nation's largest. He attended the 2015 installment as vice president and returned in 2018. Both times, Biden, now 79, faced questions about whether he'd run for president in coming elections \u2014 which he opted against in 2016 before winning the White House in 2020. This year, the oldest president in U.S. history has faced speculation about if he'll seek a second term in 2024 \u2014 though he's insisted that's his intention, and the pressure has dissipated some in recent weeks after a string of policy and political successes for Biden and his party. Still, both perennial presidential battleground states Biden was visiting Monday may provide key measures of Democrats' strength before this November and 2024. With inflation still raging and the president's approval ratings remaining low, how much Biden can help his party in top races \u2014 and how much candidates want him to try \u2014 remains to be seen. That was on display in Wisconsin, where Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes is trying to unseat incumbent Sen. Johnson, but did not appear with him in Milwaukee. In the state's other top race, Tim Michels, a construction executive endorsed by Trump, is attempting to deny Democratic Gov. Tony Evers a second term. Evers also spoke at the labor event Biden addressed and briefly greeted the president in a backstage photo line. \"We have a president who understands the challenges facing working families,\" Evers told the crowd. He said that Biden \"hasn't forgotten that working families matter, not just on Labor Day, but every single day of the year.\" Pennsylvania voters are choosing a new governor, with state Attorney General John Shapiro facing another Trump-endorsed Republican, Doug Mastriano, and a new senator. That race is between Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and Trump-backed celebrity heart physician Mehmet Oz. Shapiro and Fetterman both planned to attend Monday's Pittsburgh parade. The Pennsylvania and Wisconsin races could decide which party controls the Senate next year, while the winner of each governorship may influence results in 2024\u2032s presidential election. The stakes are particularly high given that some Trump-aligned candidates have spread lies about widespread fraud that did not occur during the 2020 election \u2014 raising questions about what might happen if a candidate they don't support wins the next presidential contest. Vice President Kamala Harris paid tribute to organized labor in at breakfast meeting with the Greater Boston Labor Council, declaring \"When union wages go up, everybody's wages go up.\" \"When union workplaces are safer everyone is safer,\" Harris said. \"When unions are strong, America is strong.\""},

Judge Aileen Cannon at the same time temporarily blocked the Department of Justice from reviewing or using the seized material for investigative purposes, until the special master's examination of the documents is completed, or until a further court order. That independent third party will examine \"the seized property for personal items and documents and potentially privileged material subject to claims of attorney-client and/or executive privilege,\" Cannon wrote in her order in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Cannon said her order would not impede an ongoing review of classified documents found at Trump's residence and the assessment of any possible damage on U.S. intelligence by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The DOJ is conducting a criminal probe of the removal of government records from the White House to Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach when he left office in January 2021. By law, such records should have been given to the National Archives and Records Administration at the end of Trump's term. The judge, who was appointed by Trump, in her ruling nodded at the fact that the Aug. 8 raid at Mar-a-Lago was the first time that law enforcement authorities had ever searched the residence of a former president as part of a criminal probe of that person. As Trump's lawyers argued at a court hearing last week, Cannon wrote, \"the investigation and treatment of a former president is of unique interest to the general public, and the country is served best by an orderly\nprocess that promotes the interest and perception of fairness.\" Cannon ordered the DOJ and Trump's lawyers to confer and jointly submit a list of proposed special master candidates by Friday. She also told them to outline what they believe should be the special master's duties and limitations, as well as the watchdog's compensation. Trump had asked for a special master to be appointed weeks after the raid, during which FBI agents found more than 10,000 government documents, more than 100 of which were classified or highly classified. FBI agents also found four dozen empty document folders marked \"classified\" during the raid, 43 or which were found in Trump's office. The remaining five empty folders with that marking were found in containers in a storage room. The FBI also found another 42 empty folders marked \"Return to Staff Secretary/Miliary [sic] Aide,\" during the raid. The DOJ had opposed the appointment of that watchdog, arguing that Trump had no right to possess the records, and that a special master review would delay its ongoing criminal investigation. But Cannon in her order said she did not believe that the review by the special master \"under the present circumstances would cause undue delay.\" The DOJ and a spokeswoman for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Cannon's order."},

Lindsey Graham", "paragraphs": " U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham believes that former President Donald Trump stands a \"pretty good chance\" of winning the 2024 U.S. presidential election, in what he said could be one of the \"greatest political comebacks in American history.\" Speaking to CNBC Saturday, Graham \u2014 a South Carolina Republican and close ally of Trump \u2014 said he had advised the former president that he had \"no chance\" of winning the election in 2020, but added that 2024 was within his reach. \"I'm literally telling you what I tell him,\" Graham told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick at the Ambrosetti Forum in Italy. \"If you lose again, the history about who you are and what you did dramatically changes,\" he said. \"If you come back, it will be one of the greatest political comebacks in American history. And if you get four more years, you can do big stuff.\" Graham, who is currently facing calls to testify in a criminal probe related to Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election, said Trump would now be able to position himself as the president of hope and action as the political and economic climate darkens under President Joe Biden. Here's what Trump might say, said Graham. \"Alright, you've lived through four years of this. You get a chance to start over,\" he said. \"Remember me? I may not be your cup of tea, but when I was president, our border was secure, we had the lowest illegal crossings in 40 years. I did it,\" he continued. \"When I was president, I stood up to China and they listened. When I was president, we had the strongest military since Ronald Reagan. When I was president, I destroyed the caliphate. When I was president, we had conservative judges, not liberal judges. He has a story to tell,\" said Graham. Ultimately, however, Graham acknowledged that it may take more than policy pledges for Trump to regain favor among American voters. \"His problem is personal,\" he said. \"His policies have stood the test of time. But has he worn the American people out in terms of his personality? \u2026 Time will tell.\" Graham's comments come as Trump is under investigation for potential violations of laws related to espionage and obstruction of justice, specifically regarding his treatment of classified White House records that he took to his residence in Mar-a-Lago, Florida. The senator has been critical of the FBI's investigation, accusing the intelligence service of double standards in their treatment of Trump versus Hillary Clinton, who was the subject of a separate investigation into her use of a private email server while secretary of state. Trump's critics argue that the two cases aren't comparable. Graham reiterated Saturday that there would be \"riots in the streets\" if Trump was prosecuted, however he separately condemned the violence seen during the Jan.6 Capitol storm. Last Thursday, a federal judge on Thursday denied Graham's latest effort to challenge a subpoena for his testimony before a special grand jury in Georgia, which is investigating possible criminal election interference by Trump and his allies in 2020. However, the judge limited the scope of the subpoena by ordering that Graham could not be questioned about phone calls he made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and his staff in the weeks after the November 2020 election between Trump and Biden. It follows continued bids by Graham to avoid testifying on the grounds that his position as a lawmaker grants him immunity under the U.S. Constitution's \"speech or debate\" clause."},

The announcement came after weeks of mounting pressure from Oz's campaign, which has questioned whether Fetterman is using his recent stroke as an excuse to avoid a public faceoff. Fetterman \"is either healthy and he's dodging the debate because he does not want to answer for his radical left positions, or he's too sick to participate in the debate,\" Oz, a celebrity doctor endorsed by former President Donald Trump, said at a press conference Tuesday. In a statement Wednesday, Fetterman responded, \"We're absolutely going to debate Dr. Oz, and it was always our intent to do that.\" \"It has simply only ever been about addressing some of the lingering issues of my stroke, the auditory processing, and we're going to be able to work that out,\" Fetterman's statement said. The Democratic lieutenant governor added that the debate will be \"sometime in the middle to end of October \u2014 as each of the past two Pennsylvania Senate races have \u2014 on a major television station to reach voters across the Commonwealth.\" Details are still being finalized, Fetterman said. \"But let's be clear this has never really been about debates for Dr. Oz,\" he added. \"This whole thing has been about Dr. Oz and his team mocking me for having a stroke because they've got nothing else.\" Politico first reported on Fetterman's announcement in an interview earlier Wednesday. Fetterman's campaign last month had refused to participate in an early September debate against Oz, accusing the Republican's campaign of mocking his status as a stroke survivor and acting in bad faith after it released a statement offering to \"pay for any additional medical personnel he might need to have on standby.\" Fetterman said in a statement at the time that he was \"eager\" to debate Oz, adding, \"as I recover from this stroke and improve my auditory processing and speech, I look forward to continuing to meet with the people of Pennsylvania.\" Fetterman said he \" almost died\" after suffering a stroke in May, just days before he won the Democratic nomination to compete for the Pennsylvania Senate seat being vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. The key swing state's Senate seat offers a major pickup opportunity for both parties, as Democrats fight to hold their razor-thin Senate majority and Republicans push to wrest control of the chamber. The stroke kept Fetterman off the campaign trail for three months. But polls of the race show he has held a lead over Oz, who has been bludgeoned with attacks characterizing him as an elitist with a stronger connection to New Jersey than Pennsylvania. Fetterman last month held his first public rally since the stroke and has conducted just four interviews with media organizations, including Politico. The outlet reported that Fetterman \"sometimes missed words while speaking\" during the 17-minute videoconference, but \"spoke at a normal pace\" and discussed a range of issues. \"He did not request to see the questions beforehand,\" Politico reported."},

Immediate family members have been informed and traveled to Balmoral. \"Following further evaluation this morning, The Queen's doctors are concerned for Her Majesty's health and have recommended she remain under medical supervision,\" Buckingham Palace had said in a statement earlier in the day. The queen's other three children, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, as well as her grandson Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, were also at the palace. Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, was on his way. His wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, is not traveling with him but potentially could join Harry in Scotland at a later date, according to a spokesperson. Princess Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, has remained in Windsor as Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis are on their first full day at their new school, Kensington Palace said. The queen, who was Britain's longest-reigning monarch, had reportedly been suffering from deteriorating health for the past several months, with doctors citing ongoing \"episodic mobility problems.\" She spent a night in the hospital last October and had been forced to cut back on her public engagements since then. She had been on vacation at her Scottish estate since late July. On Tuesday, the queen broke with tradition and appointed her 15th prime minister from Balmoral rather than traveling to Buckingham Palace, as is typical. She was also forced to cancel a planned virtual meeting with senior ministers after being advised to rest by her doctors. Britain's new prime minister, Liz Truss, who met with the queen Tuesday, said her thoughts were with her and her family. \"My thoughts \u2014 and the thoughts of people across our United Kingdom \u2014 are with Her Majesty The Queen and her family at this time,\" she said earlier Thursday. Keir Starmer, leader of Britain's opposition Labour Party, said he was deeply concerned about the news of the queen's health. \"Along with the rest of the country, I am deeply worried by the news from Buckingham Palace this afternoon,\" he said earlier Thursday in a statement. Earlier in the day, Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said she was \"profoundly concerned\" and Wales' first minister, Mark Drakeford, sent his best wishes on behalf of the people of Wales. The news of the queen's ill health came as members of Parliament were gathered in the House of Commons to hear details of the government's plan to help households and businesses with rising energy costs. Cabinet minister Nadhim Zahawi was seen entering the chamber during the meeting and speaking urgently to Truss. Notes about the developing situation were also passed to the Commons speaker and the Labour leader. Elizabeth had been queen of Britain and more than a dozen other countries since 1952, when she acceded to the throne at aged 25. Her reign saw 15 prime ministers, from Sir Winston Churchill to Liz Truss, and 14 U.S. presidents. Earlier this year, she marked her 70th year on the throne with a series of Platinum Jubilee celebrations spanning four days. The queen only traveled to Buckingham Palace twice during that time, first for her Trooping the Colour balcony appearance and then for a finale after the pageant. Her husband Philip, the longest-serving royal consort in history, died last year at aged 99."},

Burr in early 2020", "paragraphs": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Newly unsealed FBI documents paint a vivid picture of the government's evidence in a 2020 insider trading investigation of North Carolina's senior senator, Republican Richard Burr. Burr was ultimately not charged with breaking any laws. But the newly released sworn affidavit of an FBI special agent shows that the Justice Department had probable cause to believe that Burr had committed insider trading and securities fraud. As chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Burr in February 2020 abruptly liquidated more than half of his and his wife's equity holdings at a time when U.S. markets and most Americans did not yet know how bad the coronavirus pandemic was going to be. Given his position, Burr had information about the virus' spread, and about America's meager preparation for a massive pandemic, that was not available to the public. The affidavit was submitted in support of a search warrant application to seize and search Burr's phone, one that the judge in the case later granted. It lays out a startling timeline of calls and texts between Burr, his wife Brooke Burr, her brother Gerald Fauth and Fauth's wife that took place on the same days that both the Fauths and the Burrs sold off hundreds of thousands of dollars of stock, right before the market plunged. A spokesperson in Burr's Senate office did not respond to a request for comment on the newly unsealed documents. From the start, Burr has insisted that the only information he relied upon in deciding to sell his stocks was publicly available, including reports by CNBC correspondents in Asia. Nonetheless, as chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Burr was given access to classified intelligence reports in January and early February that contained dire warnings about the coronavirus. On Jan. 31, Burr received nonpublic information from a source whose name is redacted in the FBI documents. That same day, Burr put in orders to sell nearly $110,000 in stock from his and his wife's brokerage accounts. On Feb. 12, Burr ordered the purchase of approximately $1.2 million of Treasury securities, using 76% of the total holdings in Burr and his wife's joint account. \"Investors often purchase U.S. Treasury funds to hedge against a potential market downturn,\" the FBI special agent, Brandon Merriman, notes. He also noted that the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high of 29,551.42 on Feb. 12. One day after Burr's big Treasury bill purchase, Burr and his wife unloaded equity shares worth approximately $1.1 million. That the Burrs sold stock was reported at the time, but the value of the sale was only reported within a range. Monday's filing was the first time the exact amounts had been made public. According to the FBI, \"As a result of Senator Burr's sales on February 13, 2020, his portfolio went from approximately 83% in equities to approximately 3% in equities.\" A week later, markets began a steep slide as investors panicked over the potential economic damage from the coronavirus. The other person in Burr's family who sold a lot of stock on Feb. 13, 2020 was Burr's brother-in-law, Gerald Fauth. According to the affidavit, records show that a series of sell orders were placed into an account belonging to Fauth's wife, Mary Fauth, just before noon on the 13th, amounting to around $159,100. Burr's attorney, Alice Fisher, told ProPublica in May of 2020 that Burr \"did not coordinate his decision to trade on Feb. 13 with Mr. Fauth.\" But the FBI evidence released on Monday shows that Burr's wife called her brother shortly after 11 a.m. ET on the 13th, and they spoke for two minutes. Twenty minutes after that, Burr also used his cellphone to call Fauth, according to records obtained by the Justice Department. Just two minutes after Fauth's conversation with his brother-law ended, Fauth called his investment manager and they talked for just shy of half an hour. In a later interview, the adviser appears to have told the FBI that Fauth sounded hurried and that he mentioned knowing a senator in Washington. According to the FBI, the Burrs' stock sell orders were put in between 11:38 and 11:49 a.m. Fauth's orders were put in between 11:55 a.m. and 11:58 a.m. While the FBI affidavit sheds light on many of the questions surrounding Burr's stock sales, it closely protects at least one relevant piece of information: what kind of nonpublic information Burr had about the coronavirus and where he got it. But there may be some clues: Specifically, the Justice Department mentions dozens of text messages that Burr exchanged with someone whose name is redacted, but who appears to be a potential source of nonpublic information. According to the FBI, between Jan. 31, 2020, and April 7, 2020, this person and Burr \"exchanged approximately 32 text messages, nearly all of which concerned, in one way or another, the COVID-19 pandemic.\" Nearly everything about the text messages is redacted, but later in the affidavit, the government writes, \"those text messages include those discussed above, and included ones regarding other issues, such as efforts to provide face masks to the public, the 'global outlook' regarding COVID-19, and a proposed 'national lockdown.'\" If Burr was receiving this information when it wasn't being publicly discussed, that could have strengthened the government's case against him. It's still unclear why the Justice Department decided not to prosecute Burr or Fauth, and the department does not typically explain the reasons why it does not prosecute someone. But on Jan. 19, 2021, nearly a year after the questionable trades, Burr said in a statement, \"Tonight, the Department of Justice informed me that it has concluded its review of my personal financial transactions conducted early last year. \"The case is now closed. I'm glad to hear it,\" Burr said. \"My focus has been and will continue to be working for the people of North Carolina during this difficult time for our nation.\""},

Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg Jr. said that Bannon \"acted as the architect of a multi-million dollar scheme to defraud thousands of donors across the country \u2014 including hundreds of Manhattan residents.\" Bragg said that Bannon, \"We Build the Wall\" Chief Executive Officer Brian Kolfage and others involved in that campaign had repeatedly claimed that Kolfage would not be paid \"a penny\" for his work. \"But instead of pennies, [Kolfage] received more than $250,000 in a salary fund by donations,\" Bragg said. \"At least $140,000 of which, we allege, was laundered by Stephen Bannon,\" said Bragg, who spoke several hours after Bannon surrendered at Manhattan Criminal Court to face a grand jury indictment, which also charged WeBuildtheWall Inc. The district attorney said that Bannon throughout 2019 directed the We Build the Wall campaign to pay a non-profit that Bannon controlled \"tens of thousands of dollars at a time.\" \"Bannon's not-for-profit then paid a salary to [Kolfage], thereby obscuring the source of the funds, in direct contradiction to the many promises made by Bannon, We Build the Wall, and other associates in this scheme,\" Bragg said. A handcuffed Bannon, 68, appeared later Thursday in court for arraignment on six criminal counts, which include money laundering, conspiracy and scheme to defraud. He pleaded not guilty through his lawyer, David Schoen. A prosecutor asked Judge Juan Merchan to order Bannon, as a condition of his release on bail to immediately surrender any passports and to not apply for any new passports during the case. \"He's not going anywhere,\" Schoen said as he agreed to those conditions, which were imposed by the judge. \"He intends to fight these charges all the way,\" the lawyer said. Merchan ordered Bannon to return to court on Oct. 3 for a status hearing, and said he expected Bannon to appear as well for all subsequent proceedings. Bannon faces a potential maximum sentence of five to 15 years in prison if convicted of money laundering, the most serious charge in the indictment. He faces two counts of that charge. The new indictment comes more than two years after Bannon was arrested on federal charges that he and three other men defrauded donors who gave $25 million or more to fund the We Build the Wall campaign. That campaign supported the intention of then-President Donald Trump to build a wall along the southern border of the United States. Trump pardoned Bannon in that federal case on his last night before leaving office in January 2021. Presidential pardons only apply to federal crimes, and do not protect people from prosecution on state charges like the ones Bannon now faces in Manhattan. Kolfage and another man, Andrew Badolato, pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the wall scheme in April. They are scheduled to be sentenced in December. The federal trial of a third defendant in that case, Timothy Shea, ended with a deadlocked jury in June. Shea is scheduled to be retried next month. None of the three men in that federal case were charged in Thursday's indictment against Bannon. New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office participated in the investigation, said, \"There cannot be one set of rules for everyday people and another for the wealthy and powerful \u2013 we all must play by the same rules and must obey the law.\" \"Mr. Bannon took advantage of his donors' political views to secure millions of dollars which he then misappropriated. Mr. Bannon lied to his donors to enrich himself and his friends,\" James said. As he walked into Manhattan Criminal Court on Thursday morning, Bannon told a crowd of reporters and gawkers that the new prosecution against him is politically motivated. \"This is an irony, on the very day the mayor of this city has a delegation down on the border, they're persecuting people here,\" Bannon shouted over numerous hecklers jeering him. He was referring to New York City Mayor Eric Adams having dispatched a group of officials to the southern border earlier this week to meet with Border Patrol agents. That trip was part of an ongoing feud the Democrat Adams has with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, who has sent buses filled with migrants to New York City. One onlooker yelled at Bannon: \"Stop hurting America, you greasy, two-bit grifter!\" Bannon in July was convicted in U.S. District Court of Washington, D.C., of two counts of contempt of Congress. That case stemmed from his refusal to testify before the select House committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot by Trump supporters. \"We expect that case to be turned over on appeal,\" Schoen said Thursday during Bannon's arraignment in New York. Earlier this week, Bannon told NBC News that New York authorities \"decided to pursue phony charges against me 60 days before the midterm election.\" \"This is nothing more than a partisan political weaponization of the criminal justice system,\" he said."},

The attorney, Robert Costello, said Bannon will turn himself in to authorities at 9 a.m. Thursday. Asked for details about the criminal charges Bannon is expected to face, Costello told CNBC by email, \"The indictment is sealed.\" The Manhattan District Attorney's Office, which will prosecute the case, has been investigating Bannon for possible violations of New York state criminal laws in connection with more than $25 million in funds raised for an effort to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. Bannon was arrested in August 2020 on federal charges with three other men tied to that effort, which prosecutors said defrauded hundreds of thousands of donors. Federal prosecutors said at the time that Bannon received $1 million in funds from We Build the Wall and that to divert that money used a separate nonprofit he had already created to purportedly promote \"economic nationalism and American sovereignty.\" Bannon never went to trial in that federal case because he received a pardon from then-President Donald Trump right before Trump left office in January 2021. Presidential pardons do not protect people from prosecution on state charges. In a statement Tuesday to NBC News, Bannon said New York \"has now decided to pursue phony charges against me 60 days before the midterm election.\" \"This is nothing more than a partisan political weaponization of the criminal justice system,\" he said. \"I am proud to be a leading voice on protecting our borders and building a wall to keep our country safe from drugs and violent criminals,\" Bannon said in that statement. \"They are coming after all of us, not only President Trump and myself. I am never going to stop fighting. In fact, I have not yet begun to fight. They will have to kill me first.\" The New York case is the second pending criminal action Bannon faces. In July, he was convicted of two counts of contempt of Congress for refusing to testify before the select House committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot by Trump supporters."},

During an online address to the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Russia, Modi spoke of a \"special partnership\" between the two countries and expressed particular interest in bolstering their cooperation on energy and coking coal. The Indian leader also pointed to the impact of Covid-19 and the Russian-Ukraine war on global supply chains, and called for \"diplomacy and dialogue\" in ending the conflict. \"In today's globalized world, events in one part of the world create an impact on the entire world,\" said Modi, in a translation first reported by the Hindustan Times. \"The Ukraine conflict and the Covid pandemic have had a major impact on global supply chains. Food grain, fertilizer, and fuel shortages are a matter of great concern for developing countries,\" he continued. \"From the very beginning of the Ukraine conflict, we have emphasized the need to adopt the path of diplomacy and dialogue. We support all peaceful efforts to end this conflict,\" Modi added. The comments come as Western allies are seeking to step up their economic squeeze on Russia. Last Friday, the G-7 announced plans to impose a cap on the price of Russian oil in a bid to curtail the Kremlin's ability to fund its onslaught in Ukraine. However, to be successful, members said the initiative would require buy-in from the broader international community \u2014 specifically major economies such as India and China. Until now, India, which has upped its purchases of Russian oil following the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine, has refused to be held on the issue. Speaking to CNBC Monday, India's Petroleum Minister Shri Hardeep Singh Puri said the country would consider the proposals \"very carefully,\" but added that he felt no moral obligation to sign up. \"No, there's no conflict. I have a moral duty to my consumer. Do I as a democratically elected government want a situation where the petrol pump runs dry?,\" Puri told CNBC's Hadley Gamble at Gastech 2022 in Milan, Italy. As of the end of March, Russia accounted for just 0.2% of India's oil imports, according to Puri, with the vast majority of the country's oil consumption \u2014 5 million barrels per day \u2014 coming from Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. Still, Modi in his speech Wednesday heralded the growing economic links between India and Russia. Specifically, he praised the 2019 launch of the \"Act Far-East\" policy, which saw India extend a $1 billion line of credit to the resource-rich region for developments in energy, diamonds and pharmaceuticals. \"This policy has become a major pillar of the special and privileged strategic partnership between India and Russia,\" he said."},

The grand jury, which is sitting in Washington, D.C., has issued subpoenas to witnesses in connection with its probe of the Save America PAC, ABC News and The New York Times reported. That PAC was created days after the 2020 presidential election, which Trump lost to President Joe Biden. ABC, which first reported the subpoenas, noted that Trump and his allies \"have consistently pushed supporters to donate to the PAC, often using false claims about the 2020 election and soliciting donations to rebuke the multiple investigations into the former president, his business dealings, and his actions on Jan. 6.\" Trump's spokesman Taylor Budowich, in a tweet referring to the probe, wrote: \"It should surprise no one that days after [President Joe] Biden declared Trump supporters a 'threat' to democracy, his admin goes after those very same supporters & Save America PAC, which is committed to Make America Great Again.\" \"Biden is using government to divide & destroy this nation,\" Budowich wrote. Trump currently faces two pressing criminal investigations. One, being conducted by a state prosecutor in Georgia, is related to his and others' efforts to reverse the outcome of the 2020 presidential election in that state, which Biden won. The other is related to the removal of government documents from the White House to Trump's residence at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, when he left office in January 2021. The FBI last month raided Mar-a-Lago and seized thousands of such documents, including ones that were highly classified. Trump has denied any wrongdoing."},

She was 96. The queen died \"peacefully\" at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, the British royal family said. Under a long-standing plan known as \"Operation London Bridge,\" her death ushers in 10 days of national mourning. Her son Charles became king upon her death, and will be called King Charles III. With husband Prince Philip by her side, Elizabeth became queen of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand upon the death of her father, George VI, on Feb. 6, 1952. Her coronation was June 2, 1953. On Feb. 6, 2022, Elizabeth became the first British monarch to reign 70 years. In honor of the occasion, the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth held a Platinum Jubilee in June 2022. The 96-year-old monarch made an appearance with her family on the balcony of Buckingham Palace during the first day of the four-day-long Platinum Jubilee, waving to tens of thousands of people gathered below and watching an aviation display in her honor. But she was unable to attend events later on during the celebrations due to discomfort. Elizabeth's reign covered a period of massive social, economic, technological and political change. It saw the transformation of the once-global British Empire into a Commonwealth of 52 independent nations headed by the queen, and the country's entrance into and exit from the European Union. Fifteen prime ministers served under Elizabeth \u2014 from Winston Churchill on her accession to the throne in 1952 to Liz Truss, who was sworn in by the frail queen only two days before the monarch's death was announced. She also presided over a family that saw tragedy, scandal and turmoil, including the death of former Princess Diana, the association of son Prince Andrew with the late millionaire sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein, and the decision by grandson Prince Harry to seek a more private life with his wife, the former Meghan Markle. Born April 21, 1926, Elizabeth was the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York, who became King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1937 following the abdication of Edward VIII. She was the 32nd great-granddaughter of King Alfred the Great, England's first monarch, who reigned from 871 to 899. \"Lilibet\" and her younger sister, Margaret, born in 1930, were educated at home by tutors, including a governess. Soon after the coronation of Elizabeth's father, the U.K. was plunged into World War II. At 14, she made her first radio broadcast in 1940, addressing children who had been evacuated to the countryside and abroad to avoid the bombings of British cities. \"We know, every one of us, that in the end, all will be well,\" she intoned in a delicate soprano to the BBC \"Children's Hour\" audience. \"For God will care for us and give us victory and peace. When peace comes, remember it will be for us, the children of today, to make the world of tomorrow a better and happier place.\" Later during the war, the teenage princess served as a driver for the Auxiliary Territorial Service. When VE Day arrived, she and Margaret sneaked out of Buckingham Palace to mingle with the crowds on the streets of London celebrating the Allied victory in Europe. \"I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief,\" she told a biographer. On Nov. 20, 2017, Elizabeth and Prince Philip celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary. Their 73\u00bd-year marriage was by far the longest for the monarchy, surpassing that of King George III and Queen Charlotte's 57 years (1761-1818). Princess Elizabeth met Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark in 1934 at the wedding of his first cousin, Princess Marina, to Prince George, Duke of Kent. Thirteen years later, Elizabeth and Philip married at Westminster Abbey in an uplifting ceremony \u2014 two years after the end of World War II. Hundreds of thousands of people lined the streets along the route from Buckingham Palace. \"For a brief moment the pace of the strident terrible twentieth century was slowed to the trot of cavalry horses and the rumbling of coaches and pageantry evoked bitter sweet memories of this island's old, heroic past,\" The New York Times' Drew Middleton wrote in a dispatch from London. Philip, the princess' third cousin, had served with the Royal Navy during World War II. His family name was changed to Mountbatten from Battenberg during World War I because of anti-German sentiment. The union was not without controversy. Philip was broke and foreign-born, but nonetheless they received 2,500 wedding gifts from around the world. A son and heir, Charles, was born in 1948, followed by Anne, Andrew and Edward. In 1952, Elizabeth and Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, began a tour of Australia and New Zealand by stopping in Africa. While they were in Kenya, the news reached them on Feb. 6 that King George had died. At age 25, Elizabeth ascended to the throne and was crowned the following year in the first live television coronation to be broadcast around the world. In May 2017, a month before Philip's 96th birthday, Buckingham Palace announced that the duke was retiring from his royal duties as of September. Philip died at age 99 on April 9, 2021, the 16th anniversary of the marriage of Prince Charles and Camilla, and the duke's funeral was four days before Elizabeth's 95th birthday on April 21. On what would have been his 100th birthday on June 20, the queen planted a specially bred rose named the Duke of Edinburgh in Windsor Castle's East Terrace Garden. During her time on the throne, Elizabeth took her place on the global stage along with elected leaders and dictators. Her long reign saw her circling the globe many times: Following her coronation, Elizabeth and Philip took a seven-month tour, visiting 13 countries and logging more than 40,000 miles. She had met with every U.S. president from Harry S. Truman to Joe Biden, except for Lyndon Johnson. She was entertained at the White House by five presidents \u2014 Dwight Eisenhower, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. She also met five popes, from Pius XII (in 1951 before she was queen) to Francis in 2014. In 2015, Elizabeth overtook her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria to become the oldest and longest-reigning British monarch. Upon the October 2016 death of Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej, ending his 70 years on the throne, she became the world's longest-reigning monarch and head of state. She celebrated six jubilees, her 25th, 40th, 50th, 60th, 65th and 70th years on the throne, as well as the marriages of her four children and the births of eight grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren. The storybook wedding of her son Charles to Lady Diana Spencer on July 29, 1981, was attended by 2,650 guests at St. Paul's Cathedral and witnessed by nearly a billion television viewers around the world. Elizabeth's reign was also marked by crisis, including two assassinations attempts, in 1970 and 1981 in Australia and New Zealand, respectively. In 1979, her art advisor, Anthony Blunt, was unmasked as a communist spy, and Prince Philip's uncle, Lord Mountbatten, was killed by an Irish Republican Army bomb. In 1969, the queen opened palace doors to television cameras for a candid look at the family in an attempt to humanize its members. The resulting documentary, \"Royal Family,\" was seen by millions of Britons on the BBC and ITV. Critics, however, claimed it debased the Windsors, and led to the frenzied celebrity coverage of members of \"The Firm,\" as the family is known. It has not been aired since 1972. In 1992, the marriages of three of her children collapsed. Andrew divorced Sarah Ferguson, Anne divorced Capt. Mark Phillips and Diana's tell-all book revealed Charles' affair with Camilla Parker-Bowles. Charles and Diana soon began a separation that ended in divorce four years later. During an October 1992 visit by the queen to Dresden, eastern Germany, whose inner city was largely destroyed by the 1945 British-American firestorm, she was pelted with eggs. Back home the next month, on the 45th anniversary of her marriage to Philip, fire heavily damaged Windsor Castle, one of her official residences. \"1992 is not a year on which I shall look back with undiluted pleasure,\" she said in the speech, 40 years after she ascended to the throne and four days after the Windsor fire. \"In the words of one of my more sympathetic correspondents, it has turned out to be an 'annus horribilis.' I suspect that I am not alone in thinking it so.\" The year 2002, wasn't so good, either. She lost her sister, Princess Margaret, in February, and her mother, Queen Elizabeth, the 101-year-old Queen Mother, seven weeks later. In spite of republican sentiments at home and in the Commonwealth and criticism of the royal family's lifestyle, Elizabeth seemingly managed to rise above the gossip and opprobrium, with her personal popularity generally remaining high. To be sure, she was vilified for remaining at Balmoral Castle in Scotland for five days after the death of Diana on Aug. 31, 1997. In the early morning hours, Buckingham Palace issued a brief statement saying the queen and Charles were \" deeply shocked and distressed by this terrible news.\" But to the dismay of much of the nation, the royal family hunkered down at Balmoral rather than to immediately return to London. Many of her subjects were aghast that Buckingham Palace didn't fly the flag at half staff. In fact, in accordance with protocol, no flag flew on the palace until she finally returned there on Sept. 4. The family later said they stayed at Balmoral to protect and prepare her grieving grandsons, Princes William and Harry, then 15 and 12, for their mother's funeral. Still, Elizabeth's silence was deafening. \"Your people are suffering ... SPEAK TO US MA'AM,\" screamed the headline on The Mirror tabloid on Sept. 4. A day later, on the eve of the funeral, the queen gave a live televised speech, lamenting \"from my heart\" the \"dreadful news\" about the Princess of Wales, and remembering her as an \"exceptional and gifted human being\" and devoted mother. \"No one who knew Diana will ever forget her,\" the queen continued. \"Millions of others who never met her, but felt they knew her, will remember her. I for one believe there are lessons to be drawn from her life and from the extraordinary and moving reaction to her death. I share in your determination to cherish her memory.\" A generation later, in a sign of just how far the monarchy itself had come during her reign, the niece of the king who abdicated his throne so that he could marry an American divorcee welcomed the November 2017 engagement and May 2018 marriage of Harry to Markle, a divorced biracial American actress. The queen expressed similar joy upon the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's son, Archie, on May 6, 2019. But nearly two years later, the House of Windsor was rocked by the self-exiled Sussexes' charges of racism and insensitivity to an outsider. In early 2020, Elizabeth convened an emergency meeting with Charles, William and Harry to discuss the latter's attempt to step back from royal duties and live part time abroad. In typically diplomatic language, the queen's post-meeting statement said: \"My family and I are entirely supportive of Harry and Meghan's desire to create a new life as a young family. Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working Members of the Royal Family, we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent life as a family while remaining a valued part of my family.\" A year later, Harry and Meghan confirmed their decision. \"While all are saddened by their decision, The Duke and Duchess remain much loved members of the family,\" the queen said in a statement. Then in March 2021, the Sussexes aired their charges of racism during an interview with Oprah Winfrey from their home in Santa Barbara, California. Meghan alleged that a member of \"The Firm\" had raised concerns during her pregnancy with Archie about how \"dark his skin might be when he's born.\" The couple didn't identify who had raised the issue, but said it wasn't Elizabeth or Philip. The Sussexes also said the family had withdrawn security protection for them, and Meghan said she had had \"clear and real and frightening thought\" about suicide. In a statement after the interview aired, the queen responded with concern and sensitivity: \"The whole family is saddened to learn the full extent of how challenging the last few years have been for Harry and Meghan. The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning, While some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately. Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved family members.\" Three months later, in June 2021, Meghan gave birth to the queen's 11th great-grandchild, Lilibet \"Lili\" Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, named after Harry's grandmother and mother. Around that time, Elizabeth was criticized after reports that she allowed Andrew to be interviewed in Buckingham Palace by the BBC in November 2019 about his relationship with Epstein. Days after the interview, Andrew announced that the queen \"has given her permission\" for him to \"step back from public duties for the foreseeable future.\" The announcement happened to come on the 72nd anniversary of the queen's marriage to Philip. An earlier example of how the queen's years of diplomacy and experience managed to win over people was demonstrated in the 2011 state visit to Ireland, a country that spent the first half of the 20th century fighting for independence from the U.K. and the second half involved in the Northern Ireland \"troubles\" that saw 3,600 people dead, including Philip's mentor, Lord Mountbatten. Her official visit to Ireland, the first by a British monarch in a century, came nearly 13 years after the Good Friday peace agreement. Addressing a dinner in her honor at Dublin Castle, Elizabeth helped the two countries put the previous decades of strife behind them by beginning her speech in Gaelic: \"A Uachtarain, agus a chairde\" \u2014 \"president and friends.\" \"It is a sad and regrettable reality that through history our islands have experienced more than their fair share of heartache, turbulence and loss. ... To all those who have suffered as a consequence of our troubled past I extend my sincere thoughts and deep sympathy,\" she continued. \"With the benefit of historical hindsight we can all see things which we would wish had been done differently or not at all. But it is also true that no one who looked to the future over the past centuries could have imagined the strength of the bonds that are now in place between the governments and the people of our two nations. So ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to rise and join me in a toast to the president and people of Ireland.\" Later during her reign, the world shut down as the coronavirus pandemic swept the globe. On an early April day in 2020, the queen appeared in a rare video speech from Windsor Castle to promise her subjects that they will prevail over the coronavirus. The speech aired hours before then Prime Minister Boris Johnson was hospitalized for Covid-19. \"While we have faced challenges before, this one is different,\" she said. \"This time we join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavor, using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal.\" During the pandemic, Elizabeth and Philip stayed at Windsor Castle, where she performed duties remotely and where the couple received their first vaccinations in January 2021. But Covid restrictions were still in place during Philip's funeral in April 2021. To comply with the stringent pandemic-era social distancing protocols in effect across the country, the queen sat alone in mourning, dressed in black instead of her usual bright colors. A day after Philip's death, daughter-in-law Sophie Countess of Wessex told well-wishers outside Windsor Castle that \"the queen has been amazing.\" On his casket, Elizabeth left a handwritten note signed \"Lilibet,\" and on her 95th birthday four days later, she issued a statement saying she had been \"deeply touched\" by her subjects' displays of \"support and kindness.\" In her televised speech on Palm Sunday 2020, the queen promised victory over Covid. \"We will succeed \u2014 and that success will belong to every one of us. We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: We will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again.\" \u2014 Phillip Tutt, formerly of CNBC.com, and Michele Luhn contributed to this story.

Yellen, who spoke following a tour of the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, touted the Democrat-led Inflation Reduction Act, the bipartisan infrastructure law and the CHIPS and Science Act as boons to the manufacturing sector and job growth. Her speech came as Democrats aim to highlight their economic successes ahead of the midterm elections in November, which will determine whether Republicans can retake one or both chambers of Congress. President Joe Biden will travel to Ohio on Friday to promote the opening of an Intel semiconductor manufacturing facility. Many of the administration's policies conform to Yellen's so-called Modern Supply Side Economics framework. Before the pandemic, she said, higher inequality was accompanied by slower economic growth. \"And now with an economy at full employment, we are uniquely suited for a supply-side expansion that delivers sustainable growth and reduces inequality,\" Yellen said. She also noted the Biden administration's stabilization efforts \"will put the United States back to full employment in record time\" after the pandemic, declining labor force participation and the war in Ukraine weighed down the U.S. economy. \"Taken together, the bipartisan infrastructure law, the CHIPS Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act authorized among the most significant investments our country has ever made,\" Yellen said. \"I believe firmly, they will help us achieve stable sustainable growth, and they'll move us toward a fairer and more resilient economy.\" Yellen attributed an economic turnaround during the pandemic to one of President Joe Biden's political priorities upon entering the White House. \"Due to the American Rescue Plan and our vaccination campaign, the United States experienced the fastest pace of job creation in our history,\" she said. \"Household balance sheets are strong, and businesses continue to invest.\" Biden signed the $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package into law in March 2021, authorizing payments of up to $1,400 for most Americans, extending $300 per week in unemployment insurance and expanding the child tax credit. The package also included $20 billion for Covid-19 vaccinations and millions in rental assistance. The unemployment rate returned to its pre-pandemic level in July and tied for the lowest level since 1969 for every demographic group but African Americans, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. During her visit, the Treasury secretary also visited small businesses that are recipients of Detroit's Motor City Match grant program. Expansion of that program was made possible with $15 million in American Rescue Plan funding. Republicans have hammered Democrats for passing the legislation, saying the massive injection of government aid helped to fuel inflation. The $80 billion allotted to the IRS under the Inflation Reduction Act to enforce compliance of a 15% minimum tax on large corporations will help correct a two-tiered tax system \"by ensuring that large corporations and high-income earners cannot avoid paying the taxes they owe,\" Yellen said. The tax cap \u2014 the amount of money owed but unpaid to the IRS \u2014 will add up to $7 trillion over the next decade and is \"disproportionately concentrated among higher earners,\" she said. The resources from the IRA \"will enable the IRS to increase audits of taxpayers at the high end and collect taxes from those who have not paid their full bill,\" Yellen said. The GOP also has targeted the tax increases included as part of the bill, which Democrats aim to use to pay for massive investments in mitigating climate change. The CHIPS Act, a Biden-backed bipartisan law that makes a historic investment in domestic semiconductor manufacturing, will enable the U.S. to compete economically with China and other nations that have historically invested more in research and development, Yellen said. \"The United States now ranks 10th in the world in terms of R&D investments as a share of output,\" she said. \"The estimated cost [of] the retreat in public R&D is $200 billion per year in lost economic output. And meanwhile, competitors in China and the rest of the world are marching forward.\" Approximately $40 billion in incentives injected into the chip manufacturing sector will decrease foreign reliance on the technology necessary to make cars and other goods, Yellen said. Yellen said the modern supply-side policies promoted by the Commerce Department and the White House are pro-growth as well as pro-fairness. The wealthiest Americans and large corporations benefited the most from tax incentives from past administrations, she said. But the Biden administration has focused on investing in disadvantaged communities. \"In layman's terms, this approach embraces the notion that some of the best opportunities for growth occur when we invest in people in places that have been forgotten and overlooked,\" Yellen said. The Treasury secretary said the Commerce Department will establish at least 20 technology and innovation hubs \"geographically dispersed with priority for underserved and underrepresented communities.\" \"Such dispersal of economic opportunity across the country will mean good new jobs and industries,\" Yellen said."},

Many of the investments the party has touted are in key battleground states. In Arizona, Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly \u2014 whose reelection bid will help to determine Senate control \u2014 joined AT&T CEO John Stankey and Corning CEO Wendell Weeks last week to announce a new fiber optic plant outside of Phoenix that will create hundreds of jobs. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen toured Ford's electric vehicle plant in Michigan on Thursday and discussed the benefits of clean energy. Later this month, she'll travel to North Carolina, where Toyota is spending $2.5 billion to manufacture EV batteries. North Carolina will also host a critical Senate race in November. Perhaps most significantly, President Joe Biden will attend the groundbreaking of Intel 's new semiconductor facility in the swing state of Ohio on Friday \u2013 the start of an investment that could be worth up to $100 billion. Both company executives and lawmakers claim the project was made possible by legislation spearheaded by Democrats. \"When you pass good legislation, you get good results,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said this week as he ticked off a laundry list of business investments. \"It's been a long time since the American people felt that Washington is capable of doing big things to meet big challenges.\" That tone represents a shift in the rhetoric that Democrats espoused a year ago. Back then, they were focused on raising revenue from corporations and the wealthy to pay for a sweeping social spending proposal known as Build Back Better: increasing the corporate tax rate, crafting a minimum global tax on multinational businesses and imposing new taxes on millionaires and billionaires, among others. And when inflation spiked to 40-year highs, some Democrats pinned the blame on corporate profiteering. But those proposals were blocked by the party's moderates. Though most of the attention was focused on Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, centrists in the House such as Reps. Stephanie Murphy of Florida and Kurt Schrader of Oregon also expressed discomfort. And as Democrats pared back their proposals, their message became more muted as well. \"It feels like a split screen sometimes,\" said Jim Kessler, executive vice president of policy at the moderate think tank Third Way. \"But there's a real opening here for Democrats on the economy and on its relationship with business.\" Now, Democrats are framing the latest investment announcements as evidence of their success on three other bills: the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act and the Chips and Science Act \u2013 both of which required Republican support \u2013 and the Inflation Reduction Act, which Democrats passed on their own. Shaking hands with business leaders could help counter Biden's low poll numbers. A majority of voters disapprove of his handling of the economy, including 57 percent of independents, according to an August poll by NBC News. The efforts to tout business investment come as inflation has also provided Republicans with a powerful line of attack. The National Republican Senatorial Committee circulated a Gallup poll this week that showed 74% of low-income Americans had suffered financial hardship because of rising prices, up from 66% in January. \"The Democrats' recent policies \u2026 hurt middle-class families around the country and have caused a recession whether they want to admit it or not,\" an NRSC spokeswoman said. \"Democrats seem to be oblivious about solving inflation, continuing to hurt our economy, and need to be voted out in November.\" Democrats haven't dropped their talking points on making corporations pay their fair share of taxes or holding big business accountable. The Inflation Reduction Act imposed a new tax on stock buybacks and set a domestic minimum tax of 15 percent, though manufacturers won a key carveout from that provision. It also will give Medicare the authority to negotiate prescription drug prices, despite heated opposition from the pharmaceutical industry. But for now, Democrats are highlighting their alliances with businesses rather than their arguments. And even the left wing of the party is acknowledging that there could be political and economic benefits to working alongside the business community. \"I think there's an understanding among progressive thinkers in the economy that we can't just focus on redistribution. We can't just focus on taxes and transfers,\" said Lindsey Owens, executive director of Groundwork Collaborative. \"We also have to focus on pre-distribution. We also have to make the market into what we want it to be.\" "},

Lindsey Graham says he was stating the obvious with Trump riots claim", "paragraphs": " U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham on Saturday defended suggesting there would be \"riots in the streets\" if former President Donald Trump was prosecuted for mishandling classified information, saying he condemned the violence seen during the Capitol riot last year. \"What I tried to do was state the obvious,\" Graham, a South Carolina Republican and close ally of Trump, told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick at the Ambrosetti Forum in Italy. \"Here's what I said, The raid on [former] President Trump's home, the likely nominee for 2024, better bear some fruit here,\" he added. \"If it's just about mishandling classified information, we've had a standard set when it came to Hillary Clinton.\" \"Our country, the people on our side, believe that when it comes to the justice system, there are no rules regarding Trump, [it's a case of] 'get him, it doesn't matter how you get him,' so I said that if it's similar to what happened to Clinton and he gets prosecuted, it'll be one of the most disruptive events in America,\" Graham said. Trump and his allies have argued that the FBI, which is investigating Trump for potential violations of laws related to espionage and obstruction of justice, is treating him differently than it treated Hillary Clinton, who was the subject of an FBI investigation into her use of a private email server while secretary of state, but wasn't prosecuted. Trump's critics argue that the two cases aren't comparable. Graham said he rejected the violence seen on the Jan.6 Capitol riot and said \"all those people who defiled the Capitol should go to jail\" but said that any perceived unfairness toward Trump would have consequences. \"I don't want to pardon the January 6th people because that seems to reinforce the narrative that this is OK. I said something I really believe \u2014 if he does what she did with classified information and he gets prosecuted and she didn't it would create a problem.\" Graham said last week that there would be \"riots in the streets\" if Trump was prosecuted for mishandling classified information. \"I'll say this, if there's a prosecution of Donald Trump for mishandling classified information, after the Clinton debacle \u2026 there'll be riots in the streets,\" Graham told Fox News' Trey Gowdy, a former Republican congressman. Trump is currently under investigation and risks being indicted over his treatment of classified White House records that he took to his residence in Mar-a-Lago, Florida. Last week, the release of a heavily redacted affidavit showed how concerns about illegal activity and obstruction of justice led to an FBI search at Trump's resort in July. Graham conceded that he believed in \"handling classified information responsibly\" but again insisted that \"mishandling classified information is really bad but we can't have a system where one person gets prosecuted and the other doesn't.\" Asked whether Trump is the best person to represent the Republican Party in 2024, Graham said \"I think he could be.\" \"Whether you like Trump or not he was a consequential president ... I think a strong American president, unpredictable, is a good thing as long as you keep it within the boundaries. His problem is personal, his policies have stood the test of time but has he worn the American people out in terms of his personality? Time will tell. But I'll say this, after the Biden presidency, if there's a policy debate in 2024, I like his chances. If it's a personality contest, he'll be in trouble.\" Graham said he talks to Trump \"all the time\" and that the former president still thinks that he was \"cheated.\" Graham said he voted to certify the 2020 election and that Biden is the legitimate president. Trump \"genuinely believes that the system was rigged against him and I said 'Mr. President, I'm not trying to tell you to change your beliefs. I'm trying to tell you that you have no chance of winning in 2020 but you have a pretty good chance of winning in 2024 if you want to,'\" Graham said, noting that he told Trump that if he does make a comeback \"it will be one of the greatest political comebacks in American history.\" A federal judge on Thursday denied Graham's latest effort to challenge a subpoena for his testimony before a special grand jury in Georgia, which is investigating possible criminal election interference by Trump and his allies in 2020. However, the judge limited the scope of the subpoena by ordering that Graham could not be questioned about phone calls he made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and his staff in the weeks after the November 2020 election between Trump and President Joe Biden. It follows continued bids by Graham to avoid testifying on the grounds that his position as a lawmaker grants him immunity under the U.S. Constitution's \"speech or debate\" clause. Graham reiterated his position on Saturday, saying \"I didn't start this debate. You have a country prosecutor who has decided to investigate a national election and to call anybody and everybody connected with the role they played in the election. I'm a United States Senator, in our Constitution, we have a speech or debate immunity clause so that we can't be hauled into courts all over the country every time we do something somebody doesn't like.\" \"I think the court is going to recognize that my activities as a United States Senator was covered by the speech and debate clause that that the county prosecutor's desire to bring me down to Georgia oversteps the constitution.\""},

The Justice Department also asked Judge Aileen Cannon to pause her related order blocking the government from further reviewing documents marked classified that were found during last month's search of Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Palm Beach resort home. The moves came three days after Cannon approved Trump's request for a special master to sift through the seized materials to identify personal items and records that are protected by attorney-client privilege or executive privilege. The DOJ had opposed that request, saying a team of agency officials had already completed a privilege review of the documents, and that a special master could harm the government's national security interests. In another court filing Thursday, the DOJ asked Cannon to make public a notice on the status of that team's filter review process, which had been filed under seal on Aug. 30. The \"broad strokes\" of the filter notice have already been made public, since the government had described the review team's process during a court hearing last week, the DOJ said in that filing. But Trump's lawyers object to the filter notice being unsealed, even though they have offered no redactions to the document and have not identified \"any basis for asserting privilege,\" the DOJ said. The FBI seized more than 10,000 government records when it raided Mar-a-Lago on Aug. 8. Many of those documents bore classification markings, including dozens of folders that were empty when they were collected by the FBI. Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, wrote in her ruling Monday in U.S. District in Southern Florida that \"the country is served best by an orderly process that promotes the interest and perception of fairness.\" The DOJ's appeal was filed at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, which holds appellate jurisdiction over cases from district courts in Florida. The Justice Department also asked Cannon to stay her order that blocks the agency from further reviewing and using the seized documents with classification markings for criminal investigative purposes, pending the appeal. Last week, the department revealed that the FBI seized more than 100 classified documents during the raid. The DOJ said in Thursday's filing that it is likely to succeed on its appeal as it applies to the classified records, which represent a fraction of the documents that were found at Mar-a-Lago. Trump \"does not and could not assert that he owns or has any possessory interest in classified records; that he has any right to have those government records returned to him; or that he can advance any plausible claims of attorney-client privilege as to such records that would bar the government from reviewing or using them,\" the DOJ wrote."},

The world's major democracies \u2014 with the notable exception of India \u2014 have banned the import of Russian oil. They are now negotiating a ban on insuring and shipping Russian oil to other countries, unless the sale is below a set price. They aim to restrict the amount of revenue the Kremlin receives, but keep Russian oil on the market to avoid supply disruptions. Key importers of Russian oil \u2013 China, India, and Turkey \u2013 have not yet said whether they will join in the coordinated price cap or negotiate their own side deals with Russia. Their participation could determine how much leverage Western nations have to set prices. \"It's premature to start discussing the price before the coalition comes together,\" a senior Treasury official told CNBC. Foreign leaders and financial officials will have several gatherings over the next two months \u2013 at the UN General Assembly in New York, meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington, and multilateral summits overseas \u2013 to discuss the mechanism. Negotiators expect that the Group of 20 nations \u2013 or, 19 with Russia excluded \u2013 will have made a decision by the time they gather in Bali, Indonesia, in mid-November. \"It will be the expectation that the G-20 countries will have been able, by that time, to communicate their possible participation,\" the European official said. Until then, no discussions of the specific price under which to allow sale of Russian crude oil, high-value refined products and low-value refined products have taken place among allies. \"We have notions of what figures can be, but it's just figures without a strong technical ground,\" the European official said. In recent days, G-7 negotiators formalized their intention to pursue the price cap, after announcing it at the conclusion of the recent Alpine summit. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested that the U.S. doesn't necessarily need China or Russia to participate for the policy to have its intended effect. \"We're already seeing this initiative pay off because countries that are buying Russian oil at greatly discounted prices,\" Yellen said on MSNBC after meeting with G-7 negotiators on Sept. 2. \"We're having an impact.\" A senior White House official said the Biden administration expects the price cap to go into effect by the end of the year.

Barr, who served under Trump, again criticized a judge's order authorizing a so-called special master to review the thousands of documents that the FBI seized last month in a raid of Trump's Florida home Mar-a-Lago. Barr said that two major issues in the case over these materials \u2014 many of which bore classification markings \u2014 are whether the DOJ can make a case to charge Trump, and whether it should. \"Will the government be able to make out a technical case, will they have evidence by which \u2014 that they could indict somebody on, including him?\" Barr said in a Fox News interview, his third appearance on the network in five days. \"That's the first question, and I think they're getting very close to that point, frankly,\" said Barr, who led the Justice Department from early 2019 until the final months of the Trump administration. \"But I think at the end of the day, there's another question, [which] is do you indict a former president? What will that do to the country, what kind of precedent will that set, will the people really understand that this is not, you know, failing to return a library book, that this was serious,\" Barr said. \"And so you have to worry about those things, and I hope that those kinds of factors will incline the administration not to indict him, because I don't want to see him indicted as a former president,\" Barr said. \"But I also think they'll be under a lot of pressure to indict him, because \u2014 one question is, look, if anyone else would have gotten indicted, why not indict him?\" he added. Barr also said he hopes the DOJ appeals the ruling from federal Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee. Cannon authorized the appointment of a special master to review seized materials for personal items and records that are protected by executive privilege. The ruling, which Trump's lawyers sought, temporarily blocks the DOJ from reviewing or using the materials it took from Mar-a-Lago in the Aug. 8 raid. \"The problem I have with the special master is what she's done on what's called executive privilege documents. And she didn't address the only question that's in dispute, which is, can the former president have standing to say that the investigators don't even get to look at the classified documents that he wrongfully had at Mar-a-Lago,\" he said. \"She dodges it, and then she says she's bringing in a special master to look at whether stuff is executive privilege or not. That's not what the dispute is,\" Barr said. \"I hope it's appealed.\" A day earlier on Fox, Barr called Cannon's ruling \"deeply flawed in a number of ways.\" But he said it doesn't change \"the fundamental dynamics of the case,\" which are that \"documents were taken, classified information was taken and not handled appropriately, and they are looking into and there is some evidence to suggest that they were deceived.\" Spokespeople for Trump and the DOJ did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment. In another Fox interview Friday, Barr said he doubted Trump's claims that the documents taken from Mar-a-Lago were declassified, calling it \"highly improbable.\" But if Trump indeed \"stood over scores of boxes, not really knowing what was in them and said, 'I hereby declassify everything in here,' that would be such an abuse and that shows such recklessness that it's almost worse than taking the documents,\" Barr said. After that appearance, Trump slammed Barr in two social media posts, calling him \"a weak and pathetic RINO\" who \"started off OK as A.G., but faded fast.\" Trump's posts attacked Barr for his handling of former special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian meddling in the 2016 election, saying the DOJ should have released the contents of a laptop containing damaging information on President Joe Biden 's son Hunter before the 2020 election. Trump also wrote that Barr \"never fought the way he should have for Election Integrity,\" an apparent reference to Barr's refusal to back Trump's false claims that his 2020 loss to Biden was rigged through widespread fraud. Barr said in his Tuesday appearance on Fox that to Trump, a RINO is \"anyone who disagrees with him that the election was stolen.\""},

In a searing order Thursday, Judge Donald Middlebrooks said that Trump's lawsuit was merely \"seeking to flaunt a two-hundred-page political manifesto outlining his grievances against those that have opposed him.\" The former president's claims \"are not only unsupported by any legal authority but plainly foreclosed by binding precedent,\" Middlebrooks wrote in U.S. District Court in southern Florida. Trump filed the lawsuit in March, seeking tens of millions of dollars in damages for violations of the RICO Act, a federal law that aims to combat organized crime, among other claims. It came more than five years after Trump defeated Clinton in a vicious and scandal-soaked presidential campaign where Trump's relationship with Russia was a major focus. The suit claims the defendants worked to produce false or misleading evidence of damaging ties between Trump's campaign and Russia. It names dozens of people and entities as defendants, including Clinton, the DNC, ex-Clinton aide John Podesta, the law firm Perkins Coie, research firm Fusion GPS, ex-Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook, and others. Trump claimed he has suffered at least $24 million in damages as a result of the defendants' actions. His lawsuit sought to recover triple the amount in damages. \"Many of the Amended Complaint's characterizations of events are implausible because they lack any specific allegations which might provide factual support for the conclusions reached,\" Middlebrooks wrote in Thursday's order. \"What the Amended Complaint lacks in substance and legal support it seeks to substitute with length, hyperbole, and the settling of scores and grievances,\" he wrote. The judge agreed with the defendants' characterization of Trump's lawsuit as \"a series of disconnected political disputes that Plaintiff has alchemized into a sweeping conspiracy among the many individuals Plaintiff believes to have aggrieved him.\" Trump's legal team \"will immediately move to appeal this decision,\" his attorney Alina Habba said in a statement Friday morning. Middlebrooks' order was \"rife with erroneous applications of the law\" and it ignored \"numerous governmental investigations which substantiate\" Trump's conspiracy claims, Habba's statement added. Former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of 2016 Russian election meddling concluded that the Kremlin did interfere in the contest but found insufficient evidence to prove collusion with Trump's campaign. Trump has repeatedly decried the Mueller probe as a witch hunt, one of many he claims have been launched against him since his foray into politics."},

In a new interview, Cobb also said Trump's conduct on Jan. 6, 2021, while a mob of his supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol, could \u2014 at least theoretically \u2014 lead to him being barred from seeking the presidency. \"There is a simple way to disqualify President Trump,\" Cobb told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett in an interview on \"The Takeout\" podcast. \"He clearly violated the 14th Amendment of the Constitution's Article III when he gave aid and comfort and three hours of inaction with regard to what was happening on the grounds of the Capitol,\" he said. \"That clearly gave aid and comfort to the insurrectionists,\" said Cobb, who added that a joint declaration by both chambers of Congress could on those grounds block Trump from being able to regain the White House. Spokesmen for Trump did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Cobb's remarks. A former federal prosecutor, Cobb from mid-2017 to mid-2018 managed the Trump White House's legal response to then-special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In the interview, Cobb blasted Trump for what he called \"the big lie\" in denying after the 2020 election that he had lost to Biden. He also criticized the former president for his pressure campaign on Pence to not certify slates of electors from individual states that gave Biden his margin of victory in the Electoral College. \"Interfering with Pence, saying Mike deserves this when people are shouting 'Kill Pence,' I think that's outrageous,\" Cobb said. \"I think interfering with what the vice president was obligated to do, trying to persuade him in a very aggressive effort not to certify the election, and to send certain electors back, I think that was criminal,\" he added. Cobb also said he believes the chances of Trump being indicted by the Department of Justice are \"very high.\" That statement came days after William Barr, who served as U.S. attorney general in the Trump administration, said he believes the DOJ is \"getting very close\" to having enough evidence to criminally charge Trump. The Justice Department is investigating Trump for the removal of thousands of government documents, some of them highly classified, from the White House when he left office in January 2021. Cobb said he suspects the FBI recovered documents that may be related to Trump's efforts to remain in office during its Aug. 8 raid on Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida. \"This was the first time in American history that a president unconstitutionally tried to remain in power illegally, and in my own view ... I believe that would merit prosecution,\" Cobb said. \"I think the president is in serious legal water, not so much because of the search, but because of the obstructive activity he took in connection with the Jan. 6 proceeding,\" Cobb said. \"I think that and the attempts to interfere in the election count in Georgia, Arizona, Pennsylvania and perhaps Michigan,\" he added. Asked about Trump's claims that he actually won the 2020 election, Cobb said, \"I believe former President Trump to be a deeply wounded narcissist, and he is often incapable of acting other than in his perceived self-interest or for revenge.\" '\"I think those are the two compelling instincts that guide his actions,\" Cobb said. \"He doesn't believe he lost. I believe that,\" he said."},

Shortly after 10 a.m. (0900 GMT), a hearse carrying Elizabeth's oak coffin emerged from the gates of Balmoral Castle, where she died on Thursday aged 96, at the start of a slow drive to the Scottish capital. The coffin was draped in the Royal Standard of Scotland with a wreath on top made of flowers taken from the Balmoral estate including sweet peas, one of Elizabeth's favorites. Crowds, fifteen deep in places, massed in the center of Edinburgh to greet the cortege, which included the queen's daughter, Princess Anne, as it made it way to the Palace of Holyroodhouse where it was met by a military guard of honor. Soldiers from the Royal Regiment of Scotland then carried the coffin to the throne room of the palace where it will remain overnight. \"There was no way I could miss this. I would regret it for the rest of my life,\" said Eilidh Mackintosh, 62, who left her home at 6 a.m. to be sure of a good view on Edinburgh's famous Royal Mile where large crowds were gathering. \"She never let us down and I didn't want to let her down either. Now she has gone there is a big hole in the heart of the nation.\" The journey from Balmoral was the first of a series of events leading up to the state funeral at Westminster Abbey in London on Sept. 19. In an emotional tribute to his mother on Friday, the new monarch, King Charles, said she had begun a \"last great journey\" to join Prince Philip, her husband of 73 years who died last year. Her death has drawn tears, sadness and warm tributes, not just from the queen's own close family and many in Britain, but also from around the globe \u2014 reflecting her presence on the world stage for seven decades. Wherever the cortege went as it wound its way through picturesque countryside, villages, small towns and cities, people lined the road or stopped their cars to get out and watch. At one point, it passed a guard of honor formed by dozens of tractors lined up in adjacent fields by farmers. Many watched silently in the bright sunshine. Some threw flowers into the road. For others, the emotion of the moment moved them to tears. \"It's just very, very sad. I'm happy I was here to say our goodbyes,\" said Elizabeth Alexander, 69, who was born on the day the queen was crowned in 1953. Many thousands are continuing to gather at other royal palaces across Britain, and large piles of flowers are massing as people visit to pay their respects. Charles became king immediately after his mother's death and was officially proclaimed the new monarch at a ceremony on Saturday, full of pageantry and centuries-old traditions. Similar proclamations are following across the United Kingdom and the other 14 realms of which Charles is now head of state, including Australia, Canada, Jamaica, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said parliament would be recalled on Thursday to allow members to pay tribute. The queen came to the throne following the death of her father King George VI on Feb. 6, 1952, when she was just 25. Her coronation took place a year later. While Elizabeth's death was not totally unexpected given her age and deteriorating health, there was still a sense of shock at the news. \"We all thought she was invincible,\" her grandson Prince William, now the heir to the throne, told a well-wisher on Saturday as he met crowds at Windsor castle. The day of Elizabeth's funeral will be a public holiday in Britain, officials have announced. U.S. President Joe Biden said he would be there, although full details of the event and the attendees have not yet been released. Before that, her coffin will be flown to London and there will be a somber procession when it is later moved from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Hall where it will lie in state for four days. \"It goes without saying that we can expect large numbers of people,\" a spokesperson for Prime Minister Liz Truss told reporters. Truss, whose appointment as prime minister on Tuesday was the queen's last public act, will join King Charles as both the new head of state and prime minister tour the four nations of the United Kingdom in the next few days. Charles, 73, is now the 41st monarch in a line that traces its origins to the Norman King William the Conqueror who captured the English throne in 1066. Elizabeth's death has capped a difficult couple of years for the royal family. The most high-profile issue has involved her grandson Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, who stepped down from royal life in 2020 to move to California, where they both have heavily criticized the institution. That has left them alienated from the rest of the family, with Harry and his older brother William said to be barely on speaking terms. But the death of their grandmother has seen differences put aside, as they appeared together with their wives outside Windsor Castle to meet the crowds on Saturday. A royal source described it as an important show of unity at an incredibly difficult time for the family."},

Biden's remarks about national unity on the 21st anniversary of the attacks stood in contrast to his warnings in recent days about dangerous divisions in American society, including that some Republicans who support former President Donald Trump's agenda pose a threat to democracy. \"I hope we'll remember that in the midst of these dark days, we dug deep. We cared for each other. And we came together,\" Biden said, as rain fell on troops standing behind him, flanking his defense secretary and top general. Nearly 3,000 people died in the attacks, when al Qaeda hijackers flew planes into New York's World Trade Center towers and into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, while a fourth plane crashed in Pennsylvania. Passengers on United Airlines Flight 93 overcame the hijackers and the plane crashed in a field, preventing another target from being hit. The anniversary comes a year after Biden ended the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan, launched two decades ago to root out the al Qaeda militant group that carried out the 9/11 attacks after plotting them from Afghanistan. Biden's chaotic withdrawal of U.S. troops last year and the resulting rapid fall of the country to the Taliban drew criticism from members of both political parties. But Biden vowed that the fight against terrorism would continue. \"We will not rest. We'll never forget. We'll never give up,\" he said. Last month, Biden authorized a drone strike in Kabul that killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, an Egyptian surgeon who had a $25 million bounty on his head and helped to coordinate the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. The disclosure of Zawahiri's presence in Kabul raised questions about the degree to which al Qaeda is receiving sanctuary from the Taliban. U.S. military and intelligence officials had warned that a complete U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan could allow al Qaeda as well as Islamic State to strengthen and, left unchecked, to eventually plot against the United States. Biden and others argued that the threat from terrorism has spread throughout the world over the past 21 years, and that there are better ways to combat it than open-ended military deployments and war. \"Our commitment to prevent another attack on the United States is without end,\" Biden assured. The first lady, Jill Biden, attended a ceremony in Pennsylvania on Sunday morning, while Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff attended one in New York City. In New York, key moments on 9/11, such as the times at which each tower of the World Trade Center fell, were marked with a moment of silence after the tolling of a bell. Families of victims of the 9/11 attacks have waited for years to see several of the people accused of planning and assisting the hijackers brought to trial and convicted, including self-professed mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four others imprisoned at the U.S. military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. On Sunday, Biden told reporters that \"yes, there is a plan for that\" \u2014 to hold the accused plotters accountable \u2014 but declined to comment further."},

The death of 96-year-old Queen Elizabeth on Thursday after 70 years on the throne set in train long-established and highly choreographed plans for days of national mourning and a state funeral that will be held in just over a week. Charles, 73, succeeded his mother immediately on Thursday but an Accession Council met on Saturday to proclaim his succession, with his son and heir William, wife Camilla and Britain's new prime minister, Liz Truss, among those to sign the proclamation. Making his personal declaration, Charles said: \"In carrying out the heavy task that has been laid upon me, and to which I now dedicate what remains to me of my life, I pray for the guidance and help of Almighty God.\" The proclamation was also set to be read publicly in the other capital cities of the United Kingdom - Edinburgh in Scotland, Belfast in Northern Ireland, and Cardiff in Wales - and at other locations, too. The death of Elizabeth, Britain's longest-reigning monarch, has drawn an outpouring of tributes from at home and around the globe. Landmarks have been used to celebrate her life, with buildings in Europe, America and Africa lit up in the red, white and blue of the United Kingdom. In Britain, people started gathering outside royal palaces in the early hours of Saturday morning, with thousands flocking to Buckingham Palace to pay respects to the queen and Charles - who was proclaimed king at the nearby St James's Palace. \"It's a poignant time in our country's history,\" design manager Ian Bilboe, 54, said. \"(We're) here to be part of that and show respect to the late queen and also to the new king.\" Charles is king and head of state of the United Kingdom and 14 other realms including Australia, Canada, Jamaica, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. Britain has declared a period of mourning until the state funeral for Elizabeth, once described by her grandson Harry as \"the nation's grandmother\". The date for that has not been announced but it is expected in a little over a week's time. Leaders from around the world are expected in London for the funeral, including U.S. President Joe Biden, who said on Friday he would attend. Charles' coronation as king will take place at a later date - and the timing for that is not yet clear. There was a 16-month gap between Elizabeth becoming queen in 1952 and her coronation in 1953. The new king vowed on Friday to serve the nation with \"loyalty, respect and love\" in his first address to the nation as king. Earlier on Friday, returning to London from Scotland where his mother died, he was greeted with cheers, applause and a crowd singing \"God Save The King\" as he made his first public appearance outside Buckingham Palace. Charles also said in his address that he had made his eldest son William, 40, the new Prince of Wales, the title that had been his for more than 50 years and is traditionally held by the heir to the throne. William's wife Kate becomes Princess of Wales, a role last held by the late Princess Diana. Thousands have gathered since Thursday at royal palaces to pay their respects to the late queen, with some shedding tears as they laid flowers and others wanting to celebrate the life of a monarch who for most Britons was the only they have ever known. Elizabeth, who was the world's oldest and longest-serving head of state, came to the throne following the death of her father King George VI on Feb. 6, 1952, when she was just 25. Over the decades she witnessed a seismic change in the social, political and economic structure of her nation. She won praise for guiding the monarchy into the 21st Century and modernising it in the process, despite intense media scrutiny and the often highly public travails of her family. Charles, who opinion polls indicate is less popular than his mother, now has the task of securing the institution's future."},

The queen, who at 96 was the U.K.'s longest-reigning monarch, died \"peacefully\" Thursday at Balmoral Castle, Scotland, hours after doctors expressed concern for her ailing health. Thousands of Brits gathered outside Buckingham Palace in the pouring rain following the news to pay their respects. The queen \u2014 whose 70-year reign spanned the aftermath of WWII, the winding down of Britain's vast empire, the 2016 Brexit vote and a global pandemic \u2014 had come to symbolize a rare constant in a world of constant change. She is succeeded by her eldest son, who was proclaimed King Charles III hours after her death. Her passing will be marked by a period of solemn ceremony, during which no government announcements will be made until after her funeral, which will be marked with a public holiday in approximately 10 days. The Bank of England has also postponed its monetary policy meeting by a week. The suspension of normal politics comes just days after the U.K. installed its new prime minister Liz Truss, who was appointed Tuesday by the queen herself, in her final act of public service. Truss enters 10 Downing Street at a time of unique flux for Britain, inheriting a country saddled with its worst economic outlook in years, a deepening energy crisis and increased inequality. Hours before the queen's death, Truss set to work outlining her plans to combat the U.K.'s cost-of-living crisis, unveiling a broad stimulus package designed to help Brits with energy bills, which have soared following Russia's war in Ukraine. It comes after a petition to boycott energy bills began gaining traction in the U.K. The Treasury says the package, which is set to cost over \u00a3100 billion, will lower peak inflation by 4-5 percentage points. But economists have warned that the move could complicate the Bank of England's already mammoth task of curbing record-high prices, by spurring spending on goods and wages. The U.K. central bank delivered its biggest rate hike in 27 years last month, raising the benchmark to 1.75%, in a bid to bring down in inflation, which is currently the highest among G-7 nations at 10.1%. Investors had widely expected a further 50 basis point hike when the BoE next meets, but some now say it will be forced to lift rates higher and more quickly. The uncertain outlook comes as the country faces rising recessionary risks. Goldman Sachs warned last week that the U.K. could fall into recession in the fourth quarter of this year, echoing earlier forecasts from the Bank of England. Briton's are now bracing for a winter of hardship for both household and businesses. The British pound has already been on a downward trajectory over the past several months, hitting a 37-year low of $1.1469 on Wednesday. It piles pressure not only on Truss but also King Charles, Britain's two new leaders, whose role it will be to rally public sentiment during a period of crisis. The pair are set to meet later Friday in London. The monarchy also faces ongoing criticism for being outdated and absorbing public finances. Indeed, the cost and ceremony of the queen's funeral will not be lost on a country in the grips of a cost-of-living crisis. \"King Charles has already got plans \u2014 we'll see them over the coming months and certainly years \u2014 to slim down the Royal Family,\" Andrew Roberts, a historian and professor at King's College London, told CNBC Friday. \"We are facing a massive cost-of-living crisis in the U.K., obviously, and what people want to see is the Royal Family reflecting that,\" he said, adding that there may be fewer royals participating in high profile events going forward. Truss on Thursday called on Britain to \"come together as a people\" and support its new head of state. \"Queen Elizabeth II was the rock on which modern Britain was built,\" Truss said in a speech outside No. 10. \"With the passing of the second Elizabethan age, we usher in a new era in the magnificent history of our great country.\" She added that Britons should rally round Charles III to \"help him bear the awesome responsibility that he now carries for us all,\" she added. \"God save the King.\""},

Undetected fevers could lead to delays in medical care, according to the study, published Tuesday in . Temporal thermometers grew in popularity during the pandemic, and this isn't the first time that a medical tool important for evaluating Covid-19 patients has been found to not work as well as it should in Black patients. Other studies have found that pulse oximeters -- small devices that clamp onto a finger to monitor oxygen levels in the blood -- may yield inaccurate readings among people of color. \"The finding of racial bias in one category of devices could have been an anomaly. The finding of bias in thermometers as well leads to the important question of what other medical devices or diagnostics could be failing our patients,\" Dr. Sivasubramanium Bhavani, assistant professor in the Division of Pulmonology, Allergy, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine at the Emory University School of Medicine and first author of the JAMA study, wrote in an email to CNN. The new research suggests that \"23% of fevers in Black patients could go undetected with a temporal thermometer,\" Bhavani wrote. \"If fevers are going undetected, then notifications are being missed, and these missed notification pathways could lead to delays in antibiotics and could lead to worse outcomes for Black patients,\" he added. \"In the outpatient and community setting, missed fevers could lead to delayed diagnosis, which could be especially important during surges of the pandemic. If schools, churches, and workplaces were using temporal thermometers to screen for fevers, this likely led to undetected fevers in a significant percentage of Black people.\" The researchers -- from Emory University in Atlanta and the University of Hawai\u02bbi John A. Burns School of Medicine in Honolulu -- examined the performance of in detecting fever among 2,031 Black and 2,344 White patients with infections. The patients were admitted to four Emory hospitals between 2014 and 2021. The researchers didn't have an adequate sample size to evaluate whether there was inaccuracy in temporal measurements in Asian and Hispanic patients. They found that the overall temporal temperature readings tended to be lower than the oral temperature readings in Black people but not in White people. The prevalence of fever detected in the Black patients was 10.1% with the temporal thermometer, compared with 13.2% with the oral thermometer. But among White patients, the prevalence was 10.8% with temporal and 10.2% with oral. The researchers wrote in their study that the difference in temporal versus oral thermometer readings among Black patients can lead to fevers going undetected more often -- and subsequently, an illness could be misdiagnosed or even untreated. Clinicians \"depend on accurate temperature readings. We make so many decisions based on them -- on whether to start someone on antibiotics, whether to admit them to the hospital, whether to do certain procedures or testing,\" said Dr. Tom Valley, an assistant professor in the University of Michigan's Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, who treats patients in the intensive care unit at Michigan Medicine in Ann Arbor. He was not involved in the new research. Valley has studied how pulse oximeters don't work as well in measuring oxygen levels among people of color and said he is not surprised by the racial differences in the performance of temporal thermometers. \"As someone who has been involved in this work and has found something similar in a different diagnostic tool -- pulse oximetry -- unfortunately, I'm not surprised,\" he said. \"We don't know whether these problems exist unless we look for them, and if we don't look for them, we're not going to identify these problems. If we don't identify these problems, we can't fix them, and so that's part of the issue. We don't know how far this goes. We don't know how deep this goes, this racism within healthcare.\" In theory, any medical equipment that leverages infrared sensing in how it works \"will likely show discordance in its performance across people with different skin tones,\" said Dr. Leo Anthony Celi, clinical research director and principal research scientist at the , who was not involved in the new study. That's because the technology in such devices, like pulse oximeters and temporal thermometers, involves emitting and capturing light to make a measurement. For instance, pulse oximeters send light through the finger to a sensor that uses the light to detect the color of your blood and gauge blood-oxygen levels. Temporal thermometers use infrared technology to measure the heat energy your body gives off. If a device isn't calibrated for darker skin tones, the pigmentation could affect how the light is absorbed and how infrared technology works. \"Skin tone will interfere with the reflection of light,\" said Celi, . \"We think that this is just the tip of the iceberg. I suspect that over the next year, we will have an abundance of papers showing how there are products that are in use for care that are themselves not objectively accurate across different demographics.\" These inaccuracies in how a device might perform in Black and brown patients are examples of why it's important for research to be more inclusive and involve people of color in clinical trials for the design and evaluation of medical devices, Celi said. \"It's not as simple as it sounds, though. Historically, it is more difficult to recruit people of color or underrepresented individuals to clinical trials because of the problems that we have seen in the past where they were abused,\" he said. But overall, \"it really reflects the much bigger systemic problem that we have now in the way we design, we innovate, we develop health products -- not just medical devices but also medications and interventions,\" he said. \"We really need to step up in terms of making sure that the research we perform is more inclusive so that we avoid these unintended consequences of the technology that we develop.\" The new study did not analyze the exact factors behind why these racial differences in the accuracy of temporal thermometers exist -- it just found that they did. \"The way these thermometers work is by measuring radiation emitted from a large artery in the forehead. Several factors that are not completely characterize may impact the ability to detect and accurately measure that radiation. One such factor may be skin color,\" Dr. Ashraf Fawzy, an assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine, who was not involved in the new study, wrote in an email to CNN. That could suggest that the technology behind temporal thermometers was not sufficiently tested among people with dark skin. These devices also \"depend heavily\" on the user performing the temperature measurement correctly, he said. \"It may be that users of the device are placing the thermometer in the wrong location more often on Black patients leading to inaccurate readings,\" Fawzy wrote. \"The findings are certainly surprising. Unlike pulse oximeters, it is generally well known that temporal thermometers are less accurate and reliable however I personally never considered that this inaccuracy may be different between Black and White patients.\""},

When given every six months, it can prevent a Covid-19 infection in people who may not get enough protection from vaccines because their immune system can't respond effectively to them. The CDC estimates that about 7 million Americans could benefit from the protection of Evusheld. This vital therapy has been holding up well against new coronavirus variants. But in new tests, Dr. David Ho, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University, found that although this subvariant doesn't seem to bind to our cells more easily than others, it does appear to evade the ability of some antibodies to neutralize it, including those in Evusheld. \"We found that that combination antibody no longer works against this new variant, and that is the only antibody combination that's approved for prevention of Covid-19,\" Ho told CNN. Ho and his team have worked throughout the pandemic to quickly characterize new variants to help the US refine its treatment strategy. His latest research has been shared as , in advance of peer review. Ho said he has also sent his results to the National Institutes of Health and the US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA said in a statement that it \"is working with sponsors of all currently authorized therapeutics to assess the activity against any global SARS-CoV-2 variant(s) of interest and is committed to communicating with the public as we learn more.\" AstraZeneca said that the antibodies in Evusheld work together and that testing them separately may not reflect how the therapy performs in the real world. \"There is limited relevance to studies that evaluate the Evusheld component antibodies individually vs. in combination or that attempt to recreate versions of tixagevimab and cilgavimab vs authentic Evusheld. The data for the individual Evusheld antibodies are not representative of the synergistic effect of the combination as administered in the Evusheld label. Antibodies recreated in a laboratory based on publicly available information are not an accurate replication of Evusheld,\" a spokesperson said in a statement. Ho says that he did test the combination of the antibodies and that he's confident in his results. He points out that his team's conclusions echo the results of performed by scientists in China. In the meantime, Ho says, people who are immunocompromised need to know that Evusheld may not be as protective as it once was. \"Just be aware that BA.4.6 is going to be resistant, and it is gaining ground on BA.5. So folks who are immunocompromised in general should be more cautious,\" he said. Ho says that based on his research, only one monoclonal antibody -- bebtelovimab -- continues to be effective against the circulating variants. \"Now we'll be left, essentially, with one antibody,\" he says. \"Everything else is gone.\" He said the FDA has been very focused on making sure the Covid-19 vaccines are updated, but he worries that it hasn't continued to keep antibody treatments current. \"There are millions of people who have compromises to the immune system, and they would be running out of options right now,\" he said."},

Speaking Tuesday, head of the Biden administration's Covid-19 Response Team, Dr. Ashish Jha, suggested so, telling reporters that the vaccines and boosters are likely to become  A lot of people have specific questions about whether they should get it now or wait. Who should rush out and get the booster, and who can probably wait a little longer? Is there a benefit to delaying the vaccine so that it can be timed with winter holidays? And should parents of kids under 12 worry that they aren't yet eligible? To guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of One takeaway is that the booster will be an that targets both the original strain and the Omicron subvariants. This is not unusual -- it's what's done every year for the flu vaccine, where manufacturers anticipate what will likely be the strains in circulation and then target the vaccine accordingly. Another important takeaway for me is that the CDC is moving away from counting the number of vaccine doses, and instead saying that people 12 and older are considered up to date on their coronavirus vaccines if they have received the original primary series -- two doses of Pfizer, two doses of Moderna or one dose of Johnson & Johnson -- plus this updated booster. That simplifies things a lot. From the time Covid-19 vaccines were first authorized, I and other public health experts have been saying . We didn't know whether the coronavirus vaccines would be a series of two, three or four shots, after which you're done, or whether it would need to be given on regular intervals. The hepatitis vaccine, for example, is a three-dose vaccine, versus the tetanus vaccine, which requires regular boosters. And, of course, the flu vaccine is updated every year. It's looking like the coronavirus vaccines are more like the flu vaccine. Immunity wanes after a time, and there are also new strains that may benefit from more targeted vaccines. Federal health authorities have even signaled . Such cadence will be helpful, I think, because Americans are already used to getting a flu shot every year. Especially if the Covid-19 booster can be timed together with the flu shot, that could help improve vaccine uptake for both shots. The CDC says that , as long as it's been at least two months since their last vaccine. To me, though, that doesn't mean that the urgency is the same for everyone. I think it's most urgent for people who have not received any vaccine or not had Covid-19 in 2022 to get the updated booster. This is especially true for older individuals and those who have chronic medical conditions. About have not had any booster. Those individuals really should get the updated booster now. Until this latest CDC announcement, only individuals 50 and older and those who are immunocompromised have been able to get two boosters. The uptake for that second booster has also been low, with so far among individuals 50 and older. That means there are quite a few adults who have may have had their last shot in the previous calendar year. I'd advise these individuals not to wait. If someone has not gotten any vaccine, they need to get vaccinated with the primary series first. That means getting the two doses of the original Pfizer or Moderna vaccines (or two doses of Novavax or one dose of Johnson & Johnson). People need to complete the primary series prior to receiving the updated booster. People who recently recovered from Covid-19 can wait to get the updated booster. CDC guidelines say that these individuals . I think this is sound advice. Reinfection is unlikely immediately after recovery, and also there could be benefit to allowing the body time to produce antibodies from infection. The CDC also says that people are eligible to be vaccinated with the new booster if it's been at least two months since their last vaccine. I don't think most people need to rush out to get the booster exactly at the two-month mark. Some might decide to wait three or four months so that it's a little bit later in the fall; that way, they could have better protection around the holidays. I can understand why they'd want to do this. We know that the Covid-19 shots provide maximal effectiveness against infection in the several weeks after they're given. There is sustained protection against severe illness, but the effectiveness against infection wanes somewhat over time. It's hard to predict the best timing the shots, though, because we don't know what will happen this fall and winter. Right now, the case count for Covid-19 is high in a lot of parts of the country. For some people, especially those who are more vulnerable to severe illness, it makes sense to get optimal protection now. But case counts could also increase later this fall, and some others may decide to wait until a few weeks before Thanksgiving to get their booster. In general, I'd go back to the point of last vaccine or infection. If you have not been vaccinated in 2022 and have not had a recent infection, I'd advise that you get the booster sooner rather than later. But if you recently had a booster and/or Covid-19, you could probably wait a month or so, to try to have more effectiveness against infection going into holidays. No, and I don't think the case for boosting children is nearly as clear as it is for adults. The majority of children have had Covid-19. Recovery from infection, plus vaccination, affords them a very high level of protection against severe illness. I think it's fine for parents of younger children to wait until an updated booster becomes available for this age group."},

But despite covering more than of the Earth's surface, the ocean is still a relative mystery. In fact, we know more about the than we do about the sea floor; just over of the ocean bed has been mapped. Getting a fuller picture would enable us to navigate ships more safely, create more accurate climate models, lay down telecommunication cables, build offshore windfarms and protect marine species -- all part of what's known as the \"blue economy,\" projected to be worth by 2030. Underwater robotic vehicles equipped with sensors are helping gather that data quicker and more cheaply than ever before. But many of these vehicles rely on batteries with a limited lifespan, and need to return to a boat or the shore to recharge, making it difficult for them to map more remote parts of the sea. A five-year-old startup called is rising to the challenge, founded by oceanographer Yi Chao. While working at NASA, he developed technology to power ocean robots by harnessing \"the naturally occurring temperature difference\" of the sea, Chao told CNN Business. The power module can be installed on existing data-gathering robots or Seatrec's own floating device. This dives a kilometer down to examine the chemistry and shape of the seabed, using sonar to create a map of the surrounding area. The robot returns to the surface to send back its findings via satellite. As the float moves between colder and warmer parts of the ocean, material inside the module either melts or solidifies, causing pressure that in turn creates thermal energy and powers the robot's generator. \"They get charged by the sea, so they can extend their lifetime almost indefinitely,\" Chao said. A basic float model typically costs around $20,000. Attaching Seatrec's energy system adds another $25,000, Chao said. But the access to free, renewable energy and the ability to stay in the water longer makes data gathering up to five times cheaper in the long run, according to Chao. He said the startup is making fewer than 100 devices per year, primarily for marine researchers, but the technology is easily scalable -- Seatrec's energy module can also be can be retrofitted onto existing mapping devices to extend their range. New technologies that can extend the reach of data-gathering devices are crucial for mapping more remote parts of the deep sea, according Jamie McMichael-Phillips, director of the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO . \"One of the huge challenges we have is quite simply physics,\" said McMichael-Phillips. \"Unlike mapping the Earth's surface where we can use a camera [or] satellites, at sea, light does not penetrate through the water column. So we're pretty much limited to using sonar systems.\" Launched in 2017, the Seabed 2030 Project has increased awareness about the importance of the ocean floor, and given researchers and companies a clear goal to work towards: map the entire seafloor by the end of this decade. Some companies, such as , are surveying the ocean from the surface. Another startup, Bedrock Ocean Exploration, says it can provide surveys of seabed areas up to 10 times faster than traditional methods by using an autonomous electric submarine fitted with sonars, cameras and lasers; the data is then analyzed on Bedrock's own cloud platform. Even with the growing number of technologies accelerating seabed exploration, completing the map is still a logistical and financial challenge. Chao estimates that it would take 3,000 of Seatrec's floats operating over the next 10 years to fully survey the ocean. The company has raised in seed funding to scale up production of its energy harvesting system. But this is a drop in the ocean of the capital needed to fully survey the ocean, which is estimated to be \"somewhere between $3 to $5 billion,\" according to McMichael-Phillips -- \"pretty much the same order of magnitude as the cost of sending a mission to Mars.\" Bedrock's DiMare believes it's time we start investing in our own planet. \"If we want to keep Earth as a place that humans can live,\" he said, \"we have got to get a lot smarter about what's going on in the ocean.\""},

New cases reported among children in the last week of August were 14% higher than they were two weeks earlier, tracked by the American Academy of Pediatrics. They jumped even more in the South, where classes have been in session for weeks. In contrast, overall cases for all ages were down about 17% in the same timeframe. Experts say that this increased transmission is to be expected -- but that keeping kids in school should be the priority, and there are now enough ways to make sure it's done safely. \"We do see infectious diseases spread every time the school year starts. That's been a phenomenon well-known long before Covid,\" said Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the pediatric association's committee on infectious diseases. \"The good news is, we're in a much different place with this pandemic than we were two years ago, or even last year, in terms of the percentage of the population that's vaccinated.\" Eligibility for Covid-19 vaccines was expanded to include ages 5 to 11 in November, making this the first full school year in which all school-age children could have their initial series. Still, vaccination rates for children lag and have changed little recently: About 61% of children ages 12 to 17 and just 31% of children 5 to 11 have their initial series, compared with about 77% of adults, from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Children 5 and up are also eligible for a booster shot, but only those 12 and up can get the updated version. And so far, only about 10% of children ages 5 to 17 have gotten a booster. The slow rollout of vaccines for children is part of why pediatric cases became more prevalent during last school year, said Dr. Grace Lee, pediatrics professor at Stanford University School of Medicine and chair of the CDC's vaccine advisory committee. In 2020, there wasn't much virus circulating among children because most were learning from home, she said. But the negative effects of remote learning were coming into focus. conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics found that test scores among 9-year-olds plummeted in math and reading after the pandemic. And mental health-related visits to emergency rooms among adolescents saw a steep increase. \"We needed the kids to go back in person for learning. At the same time, we didn't have as many opportunities to offer vaccination in a timely manner to those who were going back to school. So that is really challenging,\" Lee said. \"Part of the reason we saw case rates jump up in pediatrics is because they were the last population to get vaccinated.\" Now, though, there's greater population immunity built up through a combination of vaccination and infection. About 4 out of 5 children in the US have had Covid-19 at some point, from the CDC that are based on the presence of antibodies in blood samples. This is a significant jump from the end of 2021, when 45% of children were estimated to have had Covid-19. That doesn't mean the potential for Covid to spread in schools should be ignored, experts say; it was still a top 10 cause of death for children last year, and there's too much uncertainty about what's to come. \"We've now been infected, vaccinated, infected, vaccinated. Where are we going this season? I do think that we have to take it one year, one month at a time,\" Lee said. Last year, the CDC updated its school guidance to prioritize in-person learning while maintaining layered prevention strategies such as masking, physical distancing and vaccinations for those who were eligible. Last month, the guidance was updated again, dropping recommendations for programs that require a negative test to stay in the classroom or restrict kids to one classroom, or cohort. Mask mandates have dropped across the county, too. However, while the CDC and others are more generally focused on preventing severe disease from Covid-19, experts say there are still benefits to avoiding infection, especially for kids in school. \"We have to really take a life course approach with children,\" Lee said, thinking about both the short- and long-term effects. In the short term, a Covid-19 infection \"completely disrupts your family life and your school life and your personal life,\" she said. \"Every time someone gets sick -- whether it's Covid or flu or anything else -- they're getting further and further behind,\" she said. And \"the burden of infection is not equitable,\" causing disparities to grow. Children can have long Covid, too -- a direct long-term risk of infection. And if enough teachers get sick, the indirect risks from the early days of school closures can resurface. As a parent herself, Lee recommends that kids continue to wear masks in schools and keep up-to-date with any vaccines they're eligible for. \"I would say kids have been the most adaptable during the pandemic. So I'm less worried about that piece of it,\" Lee said. \"My hope is that we make schools a safe and equitable place to continue to learn and that we support our children, no matter what happens.\""},
{"url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/06/business/california-emissions-regulations/index.html", "title": "How California ended up in the zero-emissions driver's seat", "paragraphs": " California's powerful Air Resources Board recently passed new regulations that essentially require all vehicles sold in the state to be electric, hydrogen-fueled or at least plug-in hybrid by the year 2035. What's more, 17 other states have agreed to follow California's lead, at least to some degree, in matters relating to air pollution, so many of those states could also adopt these requirements. A core part of federal emissions regulations since the early 1970s has been the so-called California Waiver. California, alone among all 50 US states, has the right to set its own auto emissions regulations. No other state can do that, but other states can, if they wish, choose to follow California's emission standards instead of less stringent federal standards. The states that have followed California's lead on emission standards tend to be more densely populated ones like New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts. But Nevada and New Mexico have also adopted them. Together these states account for well over a third of auto sales in the United States and about 40% of its population. It's not clear that all these states will, like California, ban sales of cars without charging ports or hydrogen tanks after 2035 but, if even some do, that could represent a large portion of the country. It may seem strange that one state -- California -- has so much power to set its own climate and emissions policies, and even to have sway over other states. The reasons for this go back over 50 years. The core reason is that California has long had air quality issues for a number of reasons. \"They had so many cars and they've got those damn mountains,\" said Richard Lazarus, a professor who teaches environmental law at Harvard University. Besides its sprawling urban and suburban areas that encourage driving and its mountain ranges that trap air -- and pollution -- parts of California also have lots of sunshine that stimulate chemical reactions that worsen pollution. \"I'm third generation Angelino, and I remember growing up as a kid when the skies were just... you could barely see across the street,\" said Allan Marks, a Los Angeles attorney whose work involves renewable energy and transportation. The histories of the California Air Resources Board and the Environmental Protection Agency, the federal agency that regulates emissions, hinge on two people you might not think of as being on the environmentalist vanguard, Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon. Both are, today, remembered as stalwart conservative Republicans and, in modern America, that often means being against environmental regulation. But, in 1967, it was Reagan, then the governor of California, who signed off on the creation of the California Air Resources Board. The new agency was created by joining together California's Bureau of Air Sanitation and the California Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Board. By this time, California had already enacted the nation's first tailpipe emissions regulations. These first regulations of car emissions prompted a push for federal standards to preempt other individual states from following suit, said Lazarus. The fear was that there might eventually be as many as 50 different emissions standards and that a federal standard, the Clean Air Act of 1970, was preferable. \"There were federal acts before the Clean Air Act, going back into the fifties, that were looking at air quality,\" said Marks. \"But a lot of what the federal government was doing was just studying the problem.\" In 1970 President Richard Nixon also created the Environmental Protection Agency, which studies and regulates pollution of all sorts, combining work that had, until then, been done by a variety of different federal agencies. The EPA oversees and applies the Clean Air Act. \"The great question of '70s is, 'Shall we surrender to our surroundings or shall we make our peace with nature and begin to make reparations for the damage we have done to our air, to our land, and to our water?'\" Nixon said in his State of the Union Address that year. By this time, the groundwork had already been laid for California to set its own rules and that continued with the \"California waiver,\" a part of federal regulations that made this special exception for California. It has been renewed many times since and, usually, without much fuss. EPA administrators are required to have compelling reasons to deny the waiver, said Lazurus, and there have been attempts, but none have been successful in the long term. The California wavier might have been a little awkward, but it prevented what was seen as potential chaos. At worst automakers would have to comply with two sets of rules but at least not three, four or even more different sets of rules. At the time, environmental concerns didn't cut across clear party lines, said Lazarus. There were Republicans as well as Democrats pushing for cleaner air and water. Nixon's actions, to some degree, were designed to head off at the pass a perceived political threat from environmentalists, according to Lazarus, though he later changed course and fought some environmental regulation. Another part of the Clean Air Act, passed in 1977, allows other states, if their air quality fails to meet federal standards, to follow California's stricter emissions rules as a way of improving their air quality. (They're not allowed to just create their own stricter rules.) So far, 17 other states have chosen to abide by California's emissions standard, at least in some part. In total, they represent more than 35% of all new auto sales in America. The auto industry has been able work well within the current system, said Marks. It has provided the stability originally sought with the creation of the Clean Air Act and the California waiver. \"Manufacturers work very collaboratively with California, trying to figure out how to meet the standards, what the standards should be,\" he said. During his tenure, President Donald Trump asked the courts to do away with the California waiver. That attempt failed or, at least, hadn't succeeded by the time Trump was turned out of office in the 2020 election. President Joseph Biden's administration dropped that effort and, in March 2022, the"},

Is it quickest to get the train or the bus? What about a taxi or a city bike? Which provider has the nearest e-scooter? It can be inconvenient and time consuming. Which is why Finnish startup MaaS Global decided to aggregate all these services into one app called Whim. Available in more than 10 cities across Europe and Asia, users can access taxis, buses, bikes, e-scooters and rental cars. \"Whim's sole purpose is to compete against car ownership,\" CEO Sampo Hietanen tells CNN Business. According to the International Energy Agency, transport is responsible for , most of which come from . If Whim can persuade users to trade their car keys for a single app offering multiple transport options, the environmental impact could be enormous, says Hietanen. He admits this isn't an easy task. To succeed Whim has to be more convenient and cheaper than owning a car. \"The car represents freedom of mobility,\" says Hietanen \u2014 even if a city dweller barely uses it, they still keep it parked outside as a \"freedom insurance.\" To compete, Whim offers rental cars and taxis, but Hietanen says that users tend to opt for public transport or micromobility (shared lightweight vehicles such as bikes or e-scooters). Users can choose between multiple tiers of service, including a pay-as-you-go option and a 30-day season ticket, which costs \u20ac62 ($73) in Helsinki \u2014 where the app is most established \u2014 for unlimited public transport and short taxi rides. The ticket also offers car rental from \u20ac55 ($65) per day. While Helsinki has well-developed alternatives to driving, that's not true of everywhere. If a city \"does not have a wide public transport system or a lot of rental cars or taxis in place\" then it will be difficult to convince people to give up their cars, says Maria Kamargianni, associate professor of transport and energy at University College London. She says apps like Whim represent the first step in tempting people away from car ownership, and adds that the availability of alternative transport options is likely to improve as the market matures. Research firm predicts the global mobility service market will grow from $4.7 billion in 2020 to $70.4 billion by 2030. Other providers include Citymapper, which for Londoners in 2019, and Moovit, which launched an in Israel last year. Whim, launched in 2016, is one of the earliest providers and has raised more than $60 million from investors such as  ,  and Toyota Financial Services. It's available in several European cities and in Tokyo, and has racked up 18 million trips globally since launch. But the business has been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, says Hietanen; with fewer people traveling, revenues are lower, stalling the company's expansion into other cities. Finnish newspaper recently reported that the company had spent \u20ac50 million ($59 million) on failed expansion ventures. Hietanen says the money was spent on integrating multiple transportation providers, establishing market readiness in several countries, and developing the complex technology that underpins the app. \"We've known from the beginning that the investment needed to create this would be substantial,\" he says, adding that the company has recently secured further investment. Though the industry is in its infancy, Hietanen is confident the demand will be there. A from the International Transport Forum (ITF) says that mobility services will be vital in meeting the needs of a growing world population and fast-paced urbanization. But for growth to happen, \"people must choose it over other travel options\" such as private motor vehicles. This is already happening, says Hietanen. According to a company survey carried out in Helsinki, 12% of its users said that Whim had prompted them to give up their cars. \"People want the more sustainable solution,\" he says, \"but they still want the freedom of being able to go anywhere, anytime.\""},

But unlike other automakers who are going all-in on EVs, Toyota said it's still not convinced that's the best path forward. The world's largest automaker in terms of vehicles sold,  has in building fully battery powered EVs, despite its history of being a leader in hybrid gas/electric vehicles more than 20 years. Rivals such as  ,  and  have far more , as well as a significant number of EVs under development. Toyota has been investing more than other automakers in efforts to develop electric vehicles powered by on-board hydrogen . The fuel cells only emissions would be water vapor, which complies with tougher environmental regulations now being put in place, such as the rules announced by California last week that would by 2035. Toyota's statement on the new battery plant investment suggested it is still looking at ways to meet tougher emission rules without depending solely on battery-powered EVs. \"Toyota believes that there is more than one option for achieving carbon neutrality. It also believes that the means of reducing CO2 emissions as much as possible and as quickly as possible while protecting the livelihoods of its customers vary greatly depending on the country and region,\" Toyota said in its statement. \"With such in mind, Toyota will continue to make every effort to flexibly meet the needs of its various customers in all countries and regions by offering multiple powertrains and providing as many options as possible.\" Unlike battery-powered EVs that can be charged at homes or at an , fuel-cell powered vehicles need a whole new fueling infrastructure that would allow them to be filled with hydrogen. And those filling options are still very limited, especially outside California. Toyota's only pure battery-powered EV offered in North America is the , which went on sale earlier this year. But Toyota recently had to advise its handful of early buyers to not drive the cars due to a . The company has yet to come up with a way to fix the problem, and thus has been forced to offer to from purchasers. About half the money Toyota said it plans to spend on EV battery production will go to expanding a plant in Liberty, NC, that is already under construction. The investment will raise the price tag on the plant from $1.3 billion to $3.8 billion. The influx of cash will also increase the number of jobs at the plant, which is due to start production in 2025, by as many as 2,100. Toyota said the plant will make batteries for both pure battery-powered EVs as well as plug-in hybrid vehicles that will have both electric motors and internal combustion engines. It is important that Toyota increase some of its US-made EV battery capacity. Recently passed for EV buyers includes limits based on where the batteries are made. That requirement calls for 50% of battery components to be manufactured or assembled in North America starting in 2023 and 60% in 2024 and 2025 for a vehicle to be eligible for the tax credit.

Now, Asia's third largest economy is ready for the next big frontier in tech: Coming up with a new generation of software companies like Zoom or Slack. The Covid-19 pandemic has forced business around the world to make huge investments in digital infrastructure, furthering the influence of companies providing software-as-a-service, or SaaS. Businesses spent an extra $15 billion per week last year on tech as they scrambled to create safe remote working environments, . SaaS companies provide web-based applications that take care of everything from how secure the software is to how well it performs. Some of the world's most well-known SaaS companies include  , SAP Concur and  , the American behemoth that owns . India's software-as-a-service industry could be worth $1 trillion in value by 2030 and create nearly half a million new jobs, according to a compiled by consulting firm McKinsey & Co. and SaaSBoomi, a community of industry leaders. There are nearly a thousand such companies in India, of which 10 are unicorns, or startups worth at least $1 billion, the report said. \"This can be as big an opportunity as the IT services industry was in the 90s,\" said Girish Mathrubootham, CEO of Freshworks, India's best-known SaaS company. It filed for an last month, joining a string of other unicorns that are going public this year. Freshworks was founded more than a decade ago in the southern Indian city of Chennai. Like Salesforce, it provides software to help companies manage relations with their customers. It's also India's oldest unicorn in the sector, having raised funds from investors such as Tiger Global and Accel, and has more than 50,000 customers. The company was last valued at $3.5 billion in a 2019 funding round, according to data firm Tracxn. Other Indian SaaS firms have found traction by focusing on niche businesses. , for example, is a unicorn that builds software for the spa and beauty salon industry. Of India's 10 SaaS unicorns, six reached that milestone in 2020, and investors around the world are paying attention. Last year, investors pumped $1.5 billion into Indian SaaS companies, four times more than in 2018 or 2019, according to the SaaSBoomi report. Investors are excited about SaaS because of the \"massive adoption\" of software over the last decade, according to Mohit Bhatnagar, managing director of Sequoia Capital India. While India is a in the global SaaS market, investors say the country could eventually dominate the sector because of two things: its vast pool of English-speaking developers, and the relatively low cost of hiring them. Thanks to the rise of India's IT industry, software engineering has become one of the most in the country. \"India actually has one of the largest developer communities in the world,\" Bhatnagar told CNN Business. Many of them have worked at some of the biggest global tech companies. Abhinav Asthana, the co-founder of Postman, pointed to his experience working as an intern at Yahoo in Bengaluru as instrumental in the decision to build his product. He came up with the idea to build a tool that would simplify the API (Application Programming Interface) testing process. An API is a programming code that defines how two applications communicate with each other, and Postman says it has made it easier for engineers to work together as they design and build their APIs. \"We saw how software was created at these global companies, and we saw API was a key problem,\" Asthana told CNN Business. Now, Postman is India's most valuable SaaS unicorn, with a valuation of $5.6 billion. The low cost of operating in India is a big plus. According to a report by  , the salary of entry-level developers in India is 85% less than their counterparts in the United States. \"If you are building a SaaS company in the US, it is better to have a million-dollar client rather than a $10,000-client because you need to pay for sales and marketing in that country,\" said Prasanna Krishnamoorthy, managing partner at SaaS accelerator Upekkha. \"When you are serving customers from India, you can have these small and mid-sized companies, as well as large ones.\" Most SaaS companies focus on global clients, similar to the strategy that was followed by India's IT giants such as TCS and  . Investors see this as a welcome change, since most of India's oldest unicorns \u2014 from Flipkart to Paytm \u2014 have focused primarily on the domestic market. Almost 98% of Fortune 500 companies use Postman's products, according to Asthana, while Freshworks' first client was based in Australia. SaaS firms are much better placed to go global than e-commerce companies like India's Flipkart, for example. They write software once, and then are able to use it multiple times. \"For a Flipkart you need billions of dollars [to grow internationally], but for a Freshwork you need much less capital to go global,\" said Mathrubootham, who is also an investor in Postman. This is because e-commerce firms require a ton of money to set up physical operations elsewhere \u2014 they have to hire delivery drivers, rent warehouses and buy inventory. Bhatnagar of Sequoia Capital said that Indian software entrepreneurs \"mastered\" the art of \"remote sales\" fairly early. \"Honestly, in this last two years, the whole world has had to understand how to do better remote sales,\" he added. Despite the euphoria, there are some hurdles Indian companies have to overcome before they can deliver on the $1 trillion promise. Indian engineers trained in the IT services industry may find it hard to develop the discipline required to build a product-focused company. In IT services, \"you are selling bodies and you say yes to everything the customer says,\" said Krishnamoorthy. SaaS companies, on the other hand, have to say no to 99% of [potential] customers, he added. And India's startup ecosytem is still relatively immature when compared to Silicon Valley. Despite the massive size of some homegrown unicorns, Mathrubootham said that the country does not have a \"global tech powerhouse product brand.\" But he hoped that future SaaS companies can change that. \"It is my personal dream to see India as a product nation,\" he added."},

This time to $15,000, making it an unusually expensive option for a car. \"After wide release of FSD Beta 10.69.2, price of FSD will rise to $15k in North America on September 5,\" Musk last month. The release of the new software version was delayed on Monday until \"probably end of week. Needs a bit more polish,\" Musk , but the price increase took effect. Some Tesla owners who paid far less for an earlier, unfinished version of the same \"full self-driving\" software that now retails for $15,000 caution that the new price does not make sense for most buyers. CNN Business spoke with 13 people who have cars with the \"full self-driving\" beta and the overwhelming majority, 11 people, said they felt it wasn't worth $15,000. These drivers say the software has improved, but not enough to warrant the price. They describe at times having to pay more attention while using \"full self-driving\" than when driving on their own, as the car can be unpredictable. More than 100,000 Tesla vehicles have been sold with the feature. Tesla buyers can purchase \"full self-driving\" outright when they buy their car, or they may opt to pay a monthly subscription fee to use the feature. Many of the Tesla drivers who spoke with CNN Business suggested that, were they in the market today for a Tesla, they would opt for the monthly subscription fee for \"full self-driving,\" which still costs $199 a month or purchase for the more affordable Enhanced Autopilot, which combines features like automated parking and automated lane changes on highways, but isn't so clearly an unfinished, imperfect product. Three people told CNN Business that they feel that \"full self-driving\" is worth the high price to them because they personally relish testing new technologies and are excited about the promise of what \"full self-driving\" might eventually become. \"I really admire the optimism of all these people,\" Brian Moody, executive editor of the online car marketplace AutoTrader.com, said of those who believe \"full self-driving\" may soon handle all driving responsibilities despite years of delays. \"I wish I could be that way.\" Moody told CNN Business that \"full self-driving\" is especially expensive compared to other available driver-assist packages like GM's SuperCruise and Nissan ProPilot Assist. SuperCruise generally costs about $2,500 -- plus a monthly $25 connectivity fee after the third year -- and ProPilot Assist can be under $2,000 in some cases. The promised functionality of these driver-assist packages is more modest. While they steer and keep up with traffic on some highways, Musk says that \"full self-driving\" will someday allow Tesla owners to that do not need a human behind the wheel. It's not unheard of for options to reach the $10,000 threshold, but such high-priced options typically include a range of add-ons like an adaptive suspension, engine upgrade and adaptive headlights, he said. Moody said he expects consumers to pay for the monthly subscription of \"full self-driving\" rather than pay $15,000 for the promise of the feature's future potential. Four years ago, Wisam Al-Rawi bought a Tesla equipped with the driver-assist software the company calls \"full self-driving.\" He says he was happy to pay a $2,500 premium for \"full self-driving\" in anticipation that his Tesla would one day drive itself. But last month Al-Rawi, frustrated by the software's flaws, had enough. He asked Tesla to remove it. Now the California resident is surprised to see that Tesla is raising the price of \"full self-driving\" to $15,000 even as it falls short of the automaker's projections. \"I would never even pay $10,000 for it,\" Al-Rawi told CNN Business. \"They overpromised like crazy.\" But Tesla feels that the feature, which the company says remains in testing (or \"beta\") despite its wide release, will be worth much more than even the price it's selling for now. \"The FSD price will continue to rise as the software gets closer to full self-driving capability with regulatory approval,\" Musk on Twitter in 2020. \"[At] that point, the value of FSD is probably somewhere in excess of $100,000.\" But \"full self-driving\" wasn't close to what Al-Rawi heard from Musk, who has claimed every year from 2015 to 2022 that self-driving Teslas were probably a year or two away. Al-Rawi said it was stressful to use the \"full self-driving\" beta because the software would sometimes try to hit curbs or drive on the wrong side of the road. His car would brake unexpectedly at times, triggering road rage from others. \"He promised your car can be a taxi. This is going to be generating income,\" Al-Rawi said. \"Unfortunately, none of this happened.\" Al-Rawi still believes that Tesla's driver-assist features are better than any other automaker. He calls the automaker's lane-keeping feature \"fantastic.\" The \"full self-driving\" feature, which navigates local roads with steering, braking and acceleration, is where Al-Rawi had problems. Al-Rawi is far from the only one to be concerned about Teslas and unexpected braking. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which regulates motor vehicles, launched an investigation in February following hundreds of complaints of unexpected braking. But the limitations of \"full self-driving\" haven't led many Tesla owners to regret their purchase. \"There's nothing in FSD that's actually that useful, certainly not for this kind of money,\" Logan Rossignol, a Tesla \"full self-driving\" beta tester, told CNN Business. \"You're still paying for a promise. And what's that's worth to you is up to you.\" Rossignol feels the investment was worth it for him because he is a software developer and enjoys experimenting with technology. \"Full self-driving\" changes regularly due to over-the-air software updates. Drivers wake up some mornings with a new version of the technology to test and play with. Sunny Gulati, who said he paid $8,000 for \"full self-driving,\" says he feels an \"inherent joy\" from watching his Tesla try to navigate roads. He said he no longer envies other cars on the road. The system doesn't have to be perfect for him to love it. He justified the purchase of \"full self-driving\" in part because he thought it could one day make having a second car unnecessary. Gulati said that he wouldn't have been able to afford $15,000 for \"full self-driving,\" and would opt for the monthly subscription fee if purchasing today. Don Burke bought his Model S in 2019 because he wanted a vehicle that might one day drive itself. The Virginia resident said he has a form of muscular dystrophy. His legs are weakening. He will be in a wheelchair in a few years. Burke spoke with CNN Business during a multi-month road trip around the United States. He's driving as much as 600 miles a day and says that Tesla's driver-assist technology makes him a much safer driver. He said he feels humans are terrible drivers, pointing to the many deaths on roads today, and believes machines will be better. Burke said that if he was in the market again for a Tesla, the $15,000 price for \"full self-driving\" would be worth it to him. \"I love being able to be mobile,\" Burke said. \"I desperately want a machine that I can own that can drive me to where I need to be when I get in a wheelchair.\""},

For example, the Smart Summon function, in which the car slowly drives to meet its owner, is limited to 20 feet rather than 213 feet. Tesla also has not yet announced a release of the beta version of \"full self-driving\" in Europe. Tesla's driver-assist technologies, called Autopilot and \"full self-driving,\" have long pushed boundaries of what car technology is capable of. Many drivers say they feel less fatigued after using Autopilot's automatic steering function on long highway drives.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is in which Tesla vehicles using Autopilot have rear-ended emergency vehicles stopped on roadways. It expanded its investigation this summer, which could lead to a recall. It's also examining multiple fatal crashes this summer of vehicles with Autopilot striking and killing motorcyclists. The crashes have raised questions about if the Tesla cabin camera can adequately detect distracted drivers at night when visibility in the vehicle may be more difficult. Some competitors like Ford and General Motors use infrared technology instead, which may be better suited evening conditions. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment and generally does not engage with the professional news media. Recently, a video of Teslas equipped with what the company calls \"full self-driving\" running over a child mannequin led to Tesla supporters to evaluate the vehicles' safety. Euro NCAP concluded that the Model Y's automatic emergency braking system \"performed well\" in its response to pedestrians. The tests include scenarios like a child running from behind parked vehicles and a pedestrian crossing a road into which a car is turning. Tesla received a score of 7.7 out of 9 points on the emergency braking near pedestrians. Euro NCAP also noted that the Tesla system uses a camera-based system to monitor for distracted drivers and automatically changes the sensitivity of its forward collision warning system to be more reactive.

Since then it has amassed over 400 million users and launched a streaming service, a fiber broadband network, a video conferencing app and digital payments. Reliance Industries is now worth 17.8 trillion rupees ($224 billion), based on its stock market value. \"Akash and Isha have assumed leadership roles in Jio and Retail respectively.

Ambani's father, Dhirubhai, died in 2002 without a will. His death sparked a bitter feud between Ambani and his younger brother, Anil, for control of the empire. Mukesh Ambani ultimately took over the company's main oil and petrochemicals assets, while his brother assumed control of the newer ventures, including telecom and digital businesses.

Mukesh stunned India with the Jio launch, offering customers six months of free high-speed internet. The move triggered a brutal price war, forcing some companies to quit the market altogether, including Anil's Reliance Communications.

The growth is driven by younger investors \u2014 mostly under the age of 35 \u2014 and many of them are coming from smaller cities and towns, founders of two of India's biggest crypto exchanges told CNN Business. According to Sumit Gupta, CEO and co-founder of exchange CoinDCX, many Indian millennials have started \"their investing journey with crypto.\" While 20 years ago, their parents chose to invest in gold, these youngsters \"are more interested in having bitcoin as part of their portfolio,\" Gupta told CNN Business, referring to the fact that traditionally Indians chose to park their money in gold or savings accounts. is both an investment and a cultural habit in India, which is one of the largest markets for the precious metal, according to the .

The excitement over crypto is rising in India despite the country's on-again, off-again relationship with digital currencies. The central bank has long expressed concerns that cryptocurrencies can be used for money laundering and to finance terrorism. A cryptically worded proposal posted on the Indian parliament website last year even suggested the government was exploring plans to \"prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India.\" This year, however, started on a more cheerful note for enthusiasts. , the Indian government announced it would impose a 30% tax on income from virtual digital assets, which many industry experts took as a sign that crypto trading won't be banned after all. The government also said it would launch a digital rupee in the coming months. \"Taxation of virtual digital assets or crypto is a step in the right direction. It gives much-needed clarity and confidence to the industry,\" Gupta said at the time of the announcement. Siddharth Menon, the co-founder of WazirX, told CNN Business that following the announcement, his platform saw daily sign-ups jump by over 50%. He also noticed rising interest among Indian developers and other professionals in joining the crypto industry. \"I'm getting LinkedIn messages\" from senior executives in India, who are now more optimistic about the business, he said. In the past, Indian exchanges have struggled to hire and retain experienced people due to the lack of clear regulations. But the Indian government soon put a damper on the mood, by clarifying that the cryptocurrencies are not yet legal in the country. \"I am not doing anything to legalize it or ban it or not legalize it,\" Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in parliament a few days after announcing the tax rate. \"Banning or not banning will come subsequently ... But I will tax because it is a sovereign right.\" \"I think the government is not entirely sure what it wants to do from a policy perspective,\" said Anirudh Rastogi, founder of tech law firm Ikigaw Law, which works with crypto exchanges in India. \"It knows where it wants to land broadly. It wants to find the right balance where it is not disconnected from the global progress in blockchain and other tech, but it wants to also address concerns regarding cryptocurrency.\" Rastogi added that the \"extraordinarily high\" tax on crypto is a short-term fix, which will also acts as a deterrent to many investors. \"This rate is typically used to tax activities that are not considered economically productive, such as lottery,\" he said. \"So this could be an indication that the government wants to make revenue, but it does not see crypto trading as economically productive.\" For equities, India applies a 15% short-term capital gains tax if shares are sold in less than a year, and 10% if sold after a year. Gupta hopes that the government makes up its mind soon. India, with its vast pool of developers and enthusiastic young population, could be a \"superpower in the next five to 10 years,\" in cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, he said. \"What is missing right now is a clear regulatory framework,\" he added."},
{"url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/08/homes/mortgage-rates-september-8/index.html", "title": "Mortgage rates reach highest level since 2008", "paragraphs": " Mortgage rates reached their highest level since 2008, inching closer to 6% this week, as it became clearer to investors that aggressive rate hikes from the Federal Reserve would continue. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.89% in the week ending September 8, up from 5.66% the week before, according to Freddie Mac. That is significantly higher than this time last year when it was 2.88%. After starting the year at 3.22%, mortgage rates rose sharply during the first half of the year, hitting 5.81% in mid-June. But since then, concerns about the economy and the Federal Reserve's mission to combat inflation have made them more volatile. Mortgage rates rose again as markets continue to manage the prospect of more aggressive monetary policy to combat elevated inflation,\" said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist. Rates had fallen in July and early August as recession fears took hold. But comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell at the central bank's annual meeting in Jackson Hole in August refocused investors' attention back on the Fed's fight against inflation, pushing rates higher. This week, investors looked for the release of the Fed's Beige Book, which provides a regional pulse on the US economy and indicators of what may happen with interest rates at the Fed's meeting at the end of September. Wednesday's release indicated sustained price increases in all twelve Fed districts, though there was a moderating rate of increase in nine of these districts, said Jones. \"This could be an early sign of the eventual ease in inflation, which would precede slowed interest rate hikes,\" said Hannah Jones, economic data analyst for Realtor.com. The Federal Reserve does not set the interest rates borrowers pay on mortgages directly, but its actions influence them. Mortgage rates tend to track 10-year US Treasury bonds. As investors see or anticipate rate hikes, they often sell government bonds, which sends yields higher and with it, mortgage rates. As mortgage rates have moved higher and home prices remain near record highs, many home buyers have put their search on hold. A year ago, a buyer who put 20% down on a median priced $390,000 home and financed the rest with a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage at an average interest rate of 2.88% had a monthly mortgage payment of $1,295, according to calculations from Freddie Mac. Today, a homeowner buying the same priced house with an average rate of 5.89% would pay $1,849 a month in principal and interest. That's $554 more each month. Applications for mortgages dropped last week, as the 30-year fixed rate moved back toward its June highs, said Mike Fratantoni, senior vice president and chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. Rates aren't likely to drop again soon, Fratantoni said, but the strong job market should ensure people will still want to buy houses. \"There is no sign of a rebound in purchase applications yet, but the robust job market and an increase in housing inventories should lead to an eventual increase in purchase activity.\" While mortgage rates are rising, the range of rates offered also has increased, according to Freddie Mac. That means that borrowers can benefit from shopping around for a better rate. Borrowers could save an average of $1,500 over the life of a loan by getting one additional rate quote and an average of about $3,000 if they get five quotes, according to Freddie Mac's research."},

Nobody was sure how long a vaccine would take to develop, let alone whether it would even work. \"It was a calculated risk,\" Poonawalla told CNN Business. \"But I didn't see the choice at that time, to be honest. I just felt I'd regret not committing one way or another.\" To make his plan work, Poonawalla first had to raise nearly $1 billion. And the lives of hundreds of millions of the planet's most vulnerable people were at stake, since SII had pledged to provide poorer countries with jabs. If the gamble paid off, Poonawalla would save countless lives and be hailed as a hero during a period of historic turmoil. His fabulously rich family also would stand to grow even more wealthy by profiting from a significant deal. As the world gave its money \u2014 and trust \u2014 to Poonawalla, things seemed to be going according to plan. The AstraZeneca vaccine received approval from UK regulators in December 2020, and Poonawalla became a household name in India. But soon it became evident how badly Poonawalla had miscalculated the challenges that come with distributing millions of vaccines in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic. His company's ability to inoculate even his own countrymen was thrown into doubt earlier this year as a devastating wave of coronavirus hit India. He's also failed to keep up with his commitment to deliver shots to other nations \u2014 the consequences of which have dented his reputation and shed light on the perils of such heavy reliance on one manufacturer. It's easy to see why some of the biggest names in public health chose to rely on Poonawalla. Few manufacturers can come close to the scale at which SII is able to produce vaccines. The company \u2014 which was founded by Poonawalla's father, Cyrus, 55 years ago \u2014 produces 1.5 billion vaccines each year for measles, rubella, tetanus and many other diseases. The jabs are mainly distributed to low-income countries worldwide, including India. Poonawalla estimates that just over 50% of the world's babies depend on vaccines made at SII. The Poonawalla family charted an unusual path to becoming one of the world's preeminent vaccine makers. They have bred and raced thoroughbred horses since the 1940s, diversifying into pharmaceuticals, finance and real estate over the last half-century. Cyrus Poonawalla is now India's seventh-richest man, worth more than $16 billion, according to the His son Adar took over as CEO in 2011 and has focused on expanding in . To prepare for the AstraZeneca vaccine production, Poonawalla said he spent $800 million on buying chemicals, glass vials and other raw materials, as well as ramping up manufacturing capacity at his plant in the Western Indian city of Pune. More than $250 million came from the company's own funds. Another $300 million came from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which SII with to provide discounted or free doses to low-income countries. The rest was paid by other countries once SII started accepting orders for vaccines. In total, SII agreed to make up to 200 million vaccine doses for as many as 92 countries, as part of its deal with the Gates Foundation and Gavi, a vaccine alliance. All of that happened, though, before regulators signed off on the AstraZeneca vaccine. Had trials for that vaccine been unsuccessful, SII would \"just be making batches and then end up throwing them away,\" Poonawalla said. A business studies graduate of London's University of Westminster, Poonawalla said SII was able to make that decision more swiftly than many other companies, since it is a family-run business. \"The flexibility of being able to decide on the spot very quickly was really the main game-changer that enabled us to be able to do this,\" said Poonawalla, whose office in India is a refurbished . After the vaccine, Poonawalla began supplying doses to Indians and other other countries. By May, Gavi had received some 30 million jabs from SII. But Poonawalla's plans soon went awry when a second wave of Covid-19 hit India in the spring. At its peak the country was reporting over per day, though say the actual number was likely much higher. At that point, only percent of India's 1.3 billion population was fully vaccinated, and the country's national government had been slow in placing orders for more vaccines. Without a massive stockpile, states in India began to run out of the limited number of jabs they had. India then decided to the export of all vaccines, preventing SII from keeping up with its commitments elsewhere. \"I've always been a patriot for my country ... and if my country needs my facility first, I have to do what they say,\" Poonawalla said. \"There was no two ways about that.\" The inability to export vaccines hurt some of the poorest nations in the world. The director of Africa's disease control body, for example, warned India's hold on exports could be \" \" for the continent. People in several countries, from neighboring Nepal to , were left stranded after receiving the first dose of Covishield, the name of the India-manufactured vaccine. When asked why the global vaccine alliance chose to rely so heavily on one manufacturer, a Gavi spokesperson told CNN Business it had few options. At the start of 2021, \"very few vaccines were approved and available for deployment,\" the spokesperson said, adding that it was \"natural\" that SII would be contracted for early doses given its size. But public health expert Jeffrey Lazarus said there were flaws in the plan. \"Relying on one manufacturer was a mistake, which is easier to see in hindsight,\" said Lazarus, who heads the health systems research group at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health. While Poonawalla cannot be held responsible for some of the issues that led to the vaccine rollout stalling \u2014 chief among them, India's massive outbreak \u2014 his detractors have questioned parts of his approach. They point out Poonawalla hasn't delivered the number of jabs he initially promised, and they claim he hasn't been transparent about how he's been using all of the money he raised for the big vaccine push. \"There isn't much accountability for where the money he raised went,\" Malini Aisola, co-convenor of health sector watchdog All India Drug Action Network, told CNN Business. In June last year, it would make one billion doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine for low and middle income countries, with 400 million doses ready by the end of 2020. But by January 2021, the company had a stockpile of just . His critics weren't impressed, given the amount of capital he raised last year. The global media coverage also turned , with linking the global shortfall in vaccines to SII's problems, including the India export ban and a fire at the company's Pune facility. At the time Poonawalla said the fire had on Covishield production. But he has since saying that the incident has played a major role in hampering manufacturing. He also insists he was realistic about his goals. \"We always underpromise,\" Poonawalla told CNN Business, when asked whether the company pledged more than it could deliver. Still, he's been dogged by other controversies that have dented his reputation. As India's Covid-19 cases were skyrocketing in April, Poonawalla lowered the price of his vaccine and referred to the move as a \" \" \u2014 leading to heavy criticism, with activists pointing out that even a small profit is still a profit for SII. \"AstraZeneca has pledged that it won't from low income and middle income countries during the pandemic, but that does not seem to apply to SII,\" Aisola said. According to AstraZeneca, the companies the drugmaker has sublicensing agreements with, including SII, dictate their own prices. SII declined to comment on how much it has profited from the vaccine efforts so far, but Poonawalla said it is a \"very unreasonable and naive way of looking at the world\" for people to expect companies not to profit from the vaccine. While Poonawalla has yet to match his lofty goals, there is a chance that he and SII can get back on track, which is critical to ending vaccine inequality worldwide. India has decided to begin exporting vaccines once again as its own rate of inoculation increases. The nation had administered doses by October \u2014 about 90% of which came from SII, according to the company. SII also says that it has increased its production to 220 million doses a month as of October. SII is also expanding its partnerships, having signed a deal with American biotech firm Novavax to manufacture its Covid-19 vaccine, which is awaiting regulatory approvals. It's also partnering with the Russian Direct Investment Fund on production of the Sputnik vaccine."},

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has slowed global growth and raised inflation through large energy supply disruptions -- Russia accounts for well over 10% of global oil and natural gas production. Grain supply has also been disrupted, leading to a spike in commodities prices. An energy price shock and central bank pivot to fight inflation in Europe has further dampened investor sentiment. Recessions now look certain in Europe as prices of gas continue to accelerate into the winter.

They will all be replaced  ", "paragraphs": " Billions of banknotes and coins around the world featuring the portrait of are set to be replaced following her death. For almost 70 years, the Queen's image has appeared on the United Kingdom's coins, with different portraits of her profile as she aged. She was featured on the nation's banknotes for more than 60 years, the first British monarch to do so. Her portrait also features on the currency of several countries that were formerly under British rule. Since 1953, one year after the Queen took the throne, UK coins have borne five different versions of her portrait. She appeared on the country's banknotes starting in 1960. But now, the Bank of England, which prints the country's banknotes, and the Royal Mint, which makes its coins, face the sizeable task of withdrawing that and replacing it with money bearing the portrait of King Charles III. There are more than 4.7 million banknotes in circulation in the UK, worth a collective \u00a382 billion ($95 billion), according to the central bank. There are also around 29 billion coins circulating, the Royal Mint said. The new money is likely to introduced gradually, and coexist as legal tender with the old notes and coins for a period of time. A similar phase-in happened in 2017, when the Royal Mint began issuing a new 12-sided \u00a31 coin. The new coin circulated at the same time as the old round-shaped \u00a31 for six months before the latter lost its status as legal tender. But it's not just cash that will require a makeover. The UK faces a mammoth operation to change the royal insignia on thousands of post boxes and newly issued passports. The Royal Mint said in a statement on its website that coins bearing the image of the Queen \"remain legal tender and in circulation,\" and that their production would continue as usual during \"this period of respectful mourning.\" The Bank of England said that the Queen's \"iconic portraits [were] synonymous\" with some of its most important work. \"Current banknotes featuring the image of Her Majesty The Queen will continue to be legal tender,\" it said in a Thursday statement. (At one point Friday, so many people were attempting to access the Royal Mint's website that there was a virtual queue to get in.) The central bank said it would lay out its plans to replace existing banknotes once the period of mourning ends. The Royal Mint also said that it would make an announcement in due course. The Queen's image is also emblazoned on some banknotes and coins across the Commonwealth \u2014 an association of 54 countries, almost all of which were formerly colonized by the UK. In Canada, where the Queen remains the head of state, her image features on plastic $20 banknotes. \"The current polymer $20 bank note is intended to circulate for years to come. There is no legislative requirement to change the design within a prescribed period when the Monarch changes,\" Am\u00e9lie Ferron-Craig, a spokesperson for the Bank of Canada, said in a statement to CNN Business. Canada's finance minster is responsible for approving the design of new banknotes, Ferron-Craig added, and issuing those notes usually takes a few years. In Australia, too, the Queen's portrait features on the $5 note. The Reserve Bank of Australia said on Friday that there would be no \"immediate change\" to its banknotes. It added that its $5 notes would \"not be withdrawn\" and would likely stay in circulation for years."},

Colleges specializing in funeral service education are growing enrollment amid a dearth of workers in the funeral services industry. \"The shortage is so serious right now that there's a 90% job placement rate for graduates of these programs,\" said Leili McMurrough, program director at Worsham College of Mortuary Science in Wheeling, Illinois, one of the nation's oldest mortuary schools dating back to 1911. In 2021, nationwide new student enrollment in accredited mortuary science programs jumped 24% over 2020, according to the American Board of Funeral Service Education. The overall percentage increase in enrollment of students in the 58 accredited mortuary programs or institutions in the United States could be even higher this year, said McMurrough, who is also chair of the American Board of Funeral Service Education (AFBSE) Committee on Accreditation. Randy Anderson, president of the National Funeral Directors Association, is acutely aware of the labor crunch and says colleges can't churn out licensed workers fast enough to meet the need for new hires. Demand for funeral directors is especially high, and an aging workforce has made it a race against the clock, said Anderson. \"There's an urgent need to replace those who have been in the profession for many years and are retiring,\" he said. \"Over 60% of funeral home owners said they will retire in five years. That's a lot.\" The NFDA currently has more than 20,000 members, and each state has its own apprenticeship and licensing requirements, Anderson said. Most states also require funeral directors to graduate from an accredited college or university program. According to latest government data, the funeral industry generates over $16 billion in annual revenue. There were more than 18,800 funeral homes in the US in 2021, majority of them privately owned small businesses, down from 19,902 in 2010, according to industry numbers. Women currently make up as much as 72% of recent graduates of funeral services education, according to latest AFBSE numbers. Said Anderson, \"until the 1970s, men dominated. Every decade since then, the number of women coming into the profession has increased.\" And they're younger, too At Worsham, McMurrough said, the typical student is a 24- to 29-year-old woman, but many are older applicants seeking a new career. \"There's a big interest in this field from women, and it makes sense. Women absolutely have an empathetic bent and are perhaps better prepared to help families get through a very difficult life event,\" said Ed Michael Reggie, CEO of , an online resource to help families find a funeral home or crematorium provider that best meets their needs. \"No one plans to be a funeral director, unless you have a parent in the business,\" said Reggie. \"But as a first-time career, it's general not a costly degree. It's a shorter program than a full college degree and you can make $60,000 to $75,000 a year.\" Ellen Wynn McBrayer is a funeral director at Jones-Wynn Funeral Home and Crematorium, a third generation family business with two locations in Georgia. Her grandmother, Shirley Drew Jones, was the first woman to be a licensed funeral director in the state. McBrayer said her grandmother hoped more women would enter the profession. \"The new and younger people who are coming in are also more open-minded about not doing things the same way, but customizing the service to what families want,\" said McBrayer. \"A funeral is not just a day in the life but a lifetime in one day.\" Several factors are fueling growing interest in the profession. At her school, McMurrough said enrollment numbers rose after Worsham began offering its online program two years ago. \"This gave those people who had another job but were also interested in the field the flexibility to be able to pursue it,\" she said. Worsham offers a one-year associates degree (tuition $22,800) and a 16-month online associate degree program (tuition $24,800). Eighty percent of the most recent cohort of students in the college's online course were women, she said. Quick career advancement is another appeal. These aren't six figure-level jobs -- median wages for funeral industry jobs, such as funeral home managers was $74,000 and $48,950 for morticians, undertakers and funeral arrangers in 2021, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But \"you do have the opportunity to advance in just a few years from getting your college degree to becoming funeral director or even owning your own funeral home,\" said McMurrough. The pitfalls are there, too. \"There are some areas of the profession that haven't yet caught up to other industries in terms of competitive salaries. That remains a challenge in recruiting and retaining workers,\" said Anderson of the National Funeral Directors Association. Burnout is another challenge. \"At the height of the pandemic, people throughout the industry were working non-stop, without days off,\" said McMurrough. \"But you do it because you care. Yet many new students said the pandemic also influenced their desire to serve their communities, said McMurrough. \"So many people experienced death in the last two years in ways that they were not expecting. Families couldn't grieve the way they wanted to,\" she said. \"In some instances, funeral home staff became the last ones to see those who had passed instead of their own families. These moments made an impact on people.\" Hannah Walker, who graduated from Worsham over the summer, is one of them. 'I certainly did not ever plan to graduate from this program but my grandfather first opened my eyes to it,\" said Walker, 31, who lives in Michigan. Her experience with his death from prostate cancer, before the pandemic, and his funeral helped her reframe what the experience could be for other families. So about two and a half years ago, Walker took the first step, calling several funeral homes and asking if she could job shadow one of their employees to get first-hand experience. \"I did it for almost a year and realized this was for me. I cared enough to want to do this,\" she said. Walker graduated from Worsham College on Friday and has a job waiting for her at the funeral home where she job shadowed once she finishes her apprenticeship and gets her state license to practice. \"This isn't a career path for everyone,\" said Anderson. \"You have to be drawn to it and to the opportunity of helping your fellow man and be satisfied with just that.\""},

The Irish-Indian businessman made headlines in 2011 when he was Tata's chosen successor, and became the first person not directly related to the Tata family to head the company bearing their name. Mistry's family was a major stakeholder in the Mumbai-based conglomerate, which runs top-tier companies across several sectors.

Growth has stalled, youth unemployment is at a record high, , and companies are struggling with recurring The world's second biggest economy is grappling with the impact of severe drought and its vast real estate sector is suffering the consequences of running up too much debt. But the situation is being made much worse by Bejing's adherence to a , and there's no sign that's going to change this year. Within the past two weeks eight megacities have gone into full or partial lockdowns. Together these vital centers of manufacturing and transport are home to 127 million people. Nationwide, at least 74 cities had been closed off since late August, affecting more than 313 million residents, according to CNN calculations based on government statistics. Goldman Sachs last week estimated that cities impacted by lockdowns account for 35% of China's gross domestic product (GDP). The latest restrictions demonstrate China's uncompromising attitude to stamping out the virus with the strictest control measures, despite the damage. \"Beijing appears willing to absorb the economic and social costs that stem from its zero-Covid policy because the alternative \u2014 widespread infections along with corresponding hospitalizations and deaths \u2014 represents an even greater threat to the government's legitimacy,\" said Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a DC-based think tank. For Chinese leader Xi Jinping, maintaining that legitimacy is more vital than ever as he seeks to be selected for an unprecedented third term when the Communist Party meets for its most important congress in a decade \"Major policy shifts before the party congress appear unlikely, although we could see a softening in certain policies in early 2023 after Xi Jinping's political future has been assured,\" Singleton said. \"Even then, the Party is running short on both time and available policy levers to address many of the most pressing systemic threats to China's economy,\" he added. The economy will continue to worsen in the next few months, said Raymond Yeung, chief Greater China economist for ANZ Research. Local governments will be \"more inclined to prioritizing zero-Covid and snuffing out the virus outbreaks\" as the party congress approaches, he added. Tightening of Covid restrictions will hit consumption and investment during China's \"Golden September, Silver October,\" traditionally the peak season for home sales. In the meantime, a sharp slowdown in the global economy doesn't bode well for China's growth either, Yeung said, as weakening demand from the US and European markets will weigh on China's exports. He now expects Chinese GDP to grow by just 3% this year, missing Beijing's official target of 5.5% by a wide margin. Other analysts are even more bearish. Nomura cut its forecast to 2.7% this week. More than two years into the pandemic, Beijing is sticking to its extreme approach to the virus with forced quarantines, mass mandatory testing, and snap lockdowns. The policy was deemed successful in the early stage of the pandemic. China managed to keep the virus at bay in 2020 and 2021 and stave off the large number of deaths many other countries suffered, while following . At , Xi proclaimed that China's success in containing the virus was proof of the Communist Party's superiority over Western democracy. But the premature declaration of victory has come back to haunt him, as the highly transmissible Omicron variant makes the zero-Covid policy less effective. However, giving up on zero-Covid doesn't seem like an option for Xi, who this year has repeatedly put greater emphasis on defeating the virus than rescuing the economy. In in June, he said China must maintain its zero-Covid policy \"even though it might hurt the economy.\" At , he reaffirmed that approach and urged officials to look at the relationship between virus prevention and economic growth \"from a political point of view.\" \"Beijing has sought to cast its zero-Covid policies as evidence of the Party's strength, and therefore, by extension, Xi Jinping's leadership,\" Singleton said. Any change in approach may not come until next year, and even then it's most likely to be very gradual, said Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist for Pinpoint Asset Management. \"It will be a long process,\" he said, adding that Hong Kong where quarantine and testing rules for visitors have recently been relaxed could be \"an important leading indicator for what will happen in the mainland.\" While Beijing seems unwavering on its zero-Covid strategy, the government has rolled out a flurry of stimulus measures to boost the flagging economy, including unveiled last month to improve infrastructure and ease power shortages. The government is trying to achieve \"the best possible outcome\" for economic growth and jobs while sticking to zero-Covid, but it's \"very hard to balance the twin goals,\" said Yeung from ANZ. Recent data suggest the Chinese economy could be headed for another dismal performance in the third quarter. GDP in the second quarter from a year earlier, slowing sharply from growth of 4.8% in the first quarter. Official and private sector surveys released last week showed China's manufacturing industry contracting in August for the first time in three months, while growth in services slowed. \"The picture is not pretty, as China continues to battle the broadest wave of Covid infections thus far,\" Nomura analysts said in a research report on Tuesday. China's job market has deteriorated in the past few months. Most recent data showed that the unemployment rate among 16 to 24 year-olds hit an all-time high of 19.9% in July, the fourth consecutive month it had broken records. That means China now has about 21 million jobless youth in cities and towns. Rural unemployment isn't included in official figures. \"The most worrying issue is jobs,\" said ANZ's Yeung, adding that youth unemployment could climb to 20% or higher. Other economists say more job losses are likely this year as social distancing measures hurt the catering and retail industries, which in turn piles pressure on manufacturers. The deepening property market downturn is another major drag. The sector, which accounts for as much as 30% of China's GDP, has been crippled by a government campaign since 2020 to rein in reckless borrowing and curb speculative trading. Property prices have been falling, as have sales of new homes. While there could be a relaxation of zero-Covid rules in 2023, housing policy may not look very different after the party congress. \"We are unlikely to see the economy repeat the previous high growth of 5.5% or 6% for the next two years,\" said Yeung.

Apple CEO Tim Cook kicked off the annual event on Wednesday with a depicting how the Apple Watch has saved lives by calling for help. One man described how he was skating on a frozen river when the ice gave out. Another survived a plane crash in a remote area in the middle of winter. And a high school student escaped a bear encounter. Another example from the event focused on a 27-year old high school teacher went to the emergency room after her Apple Watch detected an abnormally high heart rate. According to the teacher, \"My doctor said, 'It was your watch that saved your life.\" Apple has long presented its products as tools for creativity, productivity and a positive, if aspirational, lifestyle filled with friends and family, healthy habits and outdoor activities. Some of that was still on display at this year's event, but there was a new messaging, too. The company positioned many of its products and features as safety nets in a shaky world. Apple announced new car-crash detection technology on both the Apple Watch and iPhone which it says can determine the \"precise moment of impact\" using the device's barometer, GPS and microphone. \"We truly hope you never need it, but feel a little bit safer every time you get into a car,\" said Ron Huang, Apple's vice president of sensing and connectivity, during the announcement. It also unveiled a groundbreaking tool for iPhones that relies on satellites if, for example, you're lost in the wilderness and cellular service isn't working. And it introduced a new temperature monitoring tool on the Apple Watch that can be used to track illnesses, at a time when many may still be wrestling with pandemic health anxieties. While arguably a continuation of Apple's focus on health features, particularly with its smartwatches, the emphasis on these fearful use cases nonetheless raised some eyebrows among industry watchers. \"It was a little surprising to see Apple reach for the alarmist approach and position their devices as potential life savers,\" said Ramon Llamas, research director at market research firm IDC. In recent years, Apple has promised customers that its products can help for them -- one with stronger privacy protections and family-friendly content. Now its pitch appears to have expanded to keeping people safe in the real world. \"These emergency features are like the safety bags in your car: you aren't going to need them all the time, but you're grateful when you do,\" Llamas said. The shift in tone comes as Apple confronts a new economic landscape that could make it harder to convince customers to pay three- and four-figure amounts to upgrade their devices -- especially when some of those products are not substantially different from the prior year.

They're also swallowing their medicine \u2014 US stocks initially plummeted on Thursday morning as they grappled with new, hawkish comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on top of a three-quarter point rate hike from the European Central Bank. But by the end of the day, they had shrugged it off and markets closed higher. The Federal Reserve doesn't like to surprise financial markets with rate hikes, and so it's making its intentions fairly clear. , and they delivered similar lines. One by one officials acknowledged the economic and market pain their hiking policy could inflict and then reiterated that for the time being they would keep on with their aggressive regime to fight pervasively high inflation rates.

Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Nomura analysts all used this week's messaging as reason to raise their forecasts for the next Fed policy decision on September 21 from a half point hike to three-quarters of a point. Data shows the economy has been making progress towards achieving the soft landing that the Fed is hoping for. Core and headline inflation were softer in July, commodity prices are falling, the dollar is strong, and supply-chain kinks are improving. The labor market is showing early signs of cooling off, and GDP growth is also slowing. But Fed officials have suggested that this isn't enough. \"Fed officials have sounded hawkish recently and have seemed to imply that progress toward taming inflation has not been as uniform or as rapid as they would like,\" wrote Goldman Sachs researchers led by chief economist Jan Hatzius in a note Thursday. Nothing is written in stone and a slew of economic and inflation data out later this month will guide the Fed's next moves. If next week's Consumer Price Index report surprises to the downside, the Fed may consider a less aggressive rate hike. \"Although we move to a 75 basis point rate hike in September, we acknowledge there are risks to a smaller 50 basis point hike,\" wrote Bank of America analysts. \"The Fed received some negative feedback on its messaging during the last blackout period, and it may be the case that participants feel like it is time to back away from effectively pre-announcing policy rate moves.\" on Thursday sent the United Kingdom into a period of national mourning for the country's longest-reigning monarch. That official period of reflection comes at a time of political and economic transition for the British economy. It's been less than a week since Liz Truss was sworn in as the country's prime minister and the economy is grappling with surging inflation rates, Ukraine-war induced commodity shortages, and an impending energy crisis. Financial institutions, meanwhile, are struggling to figure out how to pay their respects to the Queen while keeping more economic chaos at bay. The Bank of England delayed its next interest rate decision, due September 15, by a week. The London Stock Exchange, however, plans to continue on at full speed. The day of the Queen's funeral is expected to be a public holiday, in which case the London Stock Exchange would be closed for trading, but \"it is expected to remain open for trading as usual during the official period of mourning,\" a spokesperson told CNN. The UK government confirmed plans on Thursday to subsidize for households and businesses in order to protect its economy from freezing up this winter, .

The International Organization for Standardization, based in Geneva, approved the code on Friday. The system will separately categorize sales at gun and ammunition stores, which advocates say can help track suspicious transactions of firearms and ammunition. Visa, the world's largest payment network, will \"proceed with next steps\" the company said in a statement Sunday, \"while ensuring we protect all legal commerce on the Visa network in accordance with our long-standing rules.\" American Express said it will follow its usual business practices and work with third-party processors and partners to implement the code. \"We are focused on ensuring that we have the right controls in place to meet our regulatory and fiduciary responsibilities, as well as prevent illegal activity on our network,\" the company said in a statement Sunday.

That's good news for these people", "paragraphs": " With nearly the shortage of workers in the United States in the fight to acquire and retain talent. But for candidates who are typically overlooked by hiring managers, the labor shortage offers an opportunity. Advocates for marginalized populations such as people with disabilities, the formerly incarcerated and those who are housing-insecure, say today's labor market is enabling the people they work with to demonstrate to employers \u2014 and themselves \u2014 that they can be valuable contributors to a thriving economy. Employers today \"are more willing to give an opportunity for someone to demonstrate that they're qualified for the job,\" said Doug Smith, director of employment services at Chimes, a nonprofit organization that helps employ people with disabilities. \"We have, at least over the past year, seen a significant increase in the number of individuals being hired,\" he said. While the percentage of people with a disability who work is still very low, at 22.5%, this does represent an increase from 21.6% a year ago, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"I don't think employers can be quite as picky as they were being before,\" said Carley Kammerer, executive director of Wildflyer Coffee, a Minneapolis-based nonprofit organization that helps unhoused youth establish a stable living situation and acquire job skills. \"There is a sense of dignity and worth that comes from employment... Sometimes, just that confidence of making your own way and making a paycheck can go a long way.\" Kammerer said small-business owners are tapping her for insight \u2014 and sometimes for workers. \"People are almost seeing us as a staffing agency, so we've been able to increase opportunity and be almost like a pipeline or a referral source for our youth,\" she said. Brett Struwe, CEO of Sustenance Coffee in Minneapolis, said he had already raised pay by 15% to 20% when the labor market started to heat up last fall, but over the past six months he needs to keep up with the growth of his business. \"You have to do a lot of active recruitment to get the amount of labor you need in order to grow the business,\" Struwe said, adding that he has expanded his search and hired one of the young adults participating in the Wildflyer program to package coffee in his warehouse. The worker has been such a good fit that Struwe said he is preparing to hire a second worker from the program this fall. \"This is someone I want to be able to retain,\" he said. People with a prior felony conviction face a different \u2014 and in many ways, greater \u2014 challenge, said Aaron Sojourner, a labor economist and senior researcher at the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. \"Between 1980 and 2010, the share of Americans with a felony record tripled... the product of the rise in war on drugs and mass incarceration,\" he said. \"There's just a lot more people in our communities now who have that experience and have that barrier than there used to be.\" But as employers scramble to fill open positions, fair-chance hiring, which refers to employment practices that don't exclude or discriminate against candidates with criminal histories, is getting a closer look. \"We often don't need to post for jobs... When word gets out that you're in fair-chance hiring, you have people come to you,\" said Amanda LaGrange, CEO of RePowered, a St. Paul, Minnesota-based company that recycles electronic waste and that runs an on-the-job training program for the formerly incarcerated. \"There's a huge amount of talent, they're just disconnected,\" LaGrange said. \"So much of our work is around stigma reduction.\" Employers today seem to be more receptive to those messages. \"Employers are warming up to the idea of considering applicants they may not have previously, including those with a criminal record,\" said AnnElizabeth Konkel, senior economist at Indeed. Konkel said the number of job postings explicitly referencing these kinds of policies climbed by around 10% over the past three years, and the share of searches by job seekers using phrases like \"no background check\" has shot up by 75%. \"This data tells us that employers are broadening the pool of employees that they will consider hiring, and job seekers are aware of this,\" she said. Gabriel Mandujano, founder and CEO of Wash Cycle Laundry, operates a commercial laundry service in the Philadelphia, Boston and Washington, D.C., metro areas. \"In most of our facilities, we have to operate seven days a week,\" he said. \"One of the more frequent things we see is people might leave for a Monday-to-Friday schedule, and that's definitely something that didn't happen as frequently before the pandemic.\" Mandujano said Wash Cycle has had a longstanding commitment to employing people who are often overlooked by hiring managers, including people with criminal records and people with disabilities, a value he said has helped him add workers even during a labor shortage. Philadelphia resident Steve Stansbury had struggled to land stable employment since returning home in March 2021. \"I know it's because I have a record,\" he said. Stansbury, 34, was hired by Wash Cycle in November and promoted less than six months later. \"I actually had a conversation with my boss asking me what I wanted to do. It's what makes the job easier, because I'm doing something I like,\" he said. Stansbury said the job has given him a foundation to build a career and, he hopes, even start his own business one day. \"I haven't missed a day of work yet. I take it seriously... I don't want to go back to jail. I'm really applying myself,\" he said. \"If I didn't have this job, I don't know what I'd be doing.\" A lack of educational credentials or experience can also be a hurdle that keeps people from career-track work. \"We're seeing [fewer] people that are experienced in retail or have longevity with jobs. That's the wall we've been bumping up against,\" said Elise Lark, stores and operations manager at Paxton Gate, a natural science-themed retailer in Portland, Oregon. \"Our payroll has increased at least 30% or more, and that's just in the last year,\" Lark said, and the store recently expanded its health coverage. But even with these efforts, their attempts at hiring fell short. \"We're basically like a natural history museum, so it's very specialized retail... You need somebody who's enthusiastic about natural sciences,\" she said. Through a program that pairs local college students with mom-and-pop businesses, Lark said her store was able to hire a biology major on a part-time basis during the busy holiday season. \"This was a perfect opportunity for a student to learn real-world work experience,\" she said. Macy Buhler, owner of Yahara River Learning Center in DeForest, Wisconsin, said adding badly needed staff is a huge challenge. \"Even some Targets are paying $19 an hour. I can't compete with big companies right now, and that's a struggle,\" she said. Her preschool educators should have credentials at roughly the level of an associate's degree, but Buhler said the educational requirements can be a barrier for the young, working-class and often female child care labor pool. \"They need to work full time. They don't come from families where they can stop and go to school,\" she said. Buhler recently enrolled two new hires as part of a two-year pilot program run by the state that gives workers the opportunity to fulfill most of the requirements for their degree while being paid for on-the-job training. \"It's a more supported way for them to go back to school. I have to support them by giving them time on the job to do schoolwork,\" Buhler said, adding that one of her apprentices credited the program with making the attainment of a higher education feel accessible. \"She doesn't have people in her family who went to college [and] she told me she doesn't have anybody to give her that example.\" The labor market was already tightening up before the pandemic. Waves of retiring baby boomers, falling birth rates, a shortage of child care and a slowdown in immigration all suggested a longer-term challenge for hiring managers. And all of these issues were exacerbated by the pandemic. \"As early as 2018, when we saw unemployment rates continue to drop, [we realized] we no longer have the luxury of broadly not considering people,\" said Johnny C. Taylor Jr., president and CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management. \"The problem is the stigma\" these populations often face from human resources and hiring managers, Taylor said. \"Every employer has to... give people permission to hire from untapped pools of talent. We have to drive that into our organization.\" Attaining and maintaining stable employment is a critical part of drawing these people not only into the labor force, but into their communities at large, Sojourner said. \"When people are locked out of the labor force, they struggle to find ways to contribute to the community,\" he said. Once employed, they can support themselves and their families and contribute meaningfully to the local economy. It's better for the workers themselves, too. \"Getting an employment history definitely helps you stay employed,\" Sojourner said. It is easier for workers to have their choice of jobs if they have references and a track record to demonstrate their commitment to a job. And in an economy where the biggest wage gains are realized when workers switch jobs, having mobility is key to unlocking their earnings potential. Taylor is optimistic that today's job market and the likelihood that worker shortages will remain a challenge for employers could ultimately lower barriers for people who seek to enter or reenter the workforce. \"We've had a low and increasingly low American birth rate over the years [that] is not going to resolve itself,\" he said. \"I think there has been a true philosophical paradigm reset.\""},

There has been a surge in union activism \u2014 including strikes and organizing efforts \u2014 in the last year that is being driven by factors far beyond pay rates and benefits packages. If pay was the only issue, the nation probably wouldn't be facing the risk of its first in 30 years this coming week, a walkout that could knock the legs out from under the and be another . A presidential panel looking at that labor dispute recommended the two sides agree to a five-year contract that includes an immediate 14% raise, backpay from 2020, and a 24% pay increase over the course of the contract. That's less than the 31% in raises over five years the union is seeking, but more than the 17% previously offered by railroad management. That was enough to get some of the unions to agree to tentative deals, but not the unions that represent more than 90,000 workers, including those who make up the two-person crews on freight trains. They appear poised to strike unless Congress acts to keep them on the job. Those unions say they're not rejecting the wage offer. Rather, it's the proposals they object to, which require them to be on call, and ready to report to work, seven days a week for much of the year. If it were just a question of wages, a deal between the two sides would likely already be in place. \"We're not going to sit here and argue about [wages] or health care. We're beyond that,\" said Jeremy Ferguson, president of the union that represents conductors, one of the two workers on freight trains along with the engineer. The unions say conditions on the job are driving thousands of workers to quit jobs that they previously would have kept for their entire careers, creating untenable conditions for the remaining workers. Changing those work rules, including the on-call requirement, is the main demand. \"The word has gotten out these are not attractive jobs the way they treat workers,\" said Dennis Pierce, president of the union representing engineers. \"Employees have said 'I've had enough.'\" And it's not just the railroad workers who have reached this breaking point.

Alexis Petrakis, a member of the union's bargaining committee and a child therapist at Kaiser for the last three years, said she had never been in a union before and didn't expect to be going on strike this time. But she said the poor quality of care and the company's inability to schedule visits for new patients for up to six weeks because of staffing issues, have pushed her and her co-workers to walk out. \"Being away from my patients is heartbreaking. But what I go back to is they were getting inadequate care,\" Petrakis said. \"The curtain is being lifted on this broken system. It needs to change now.

It was the first successful union vote at an  facility. and the desire to in the way stores are run are major reasons why baristas at more than 200 Starbucks nationwide have in the last nine months. These noneconomic issues might seem unique to today, but they were behind the very foundation of the US labor movement a century ago. Employees fighting for safer working conditions and quality-of-life issues such as weekends off, holidays, paid vacation and a 40-hour week helped unions establish a toehold in the US and led to their growth in the first half of the 20th century. Union members aren't the only ones voicing concerns about these issues. Some economists attribute the so-called \" \" that saw a record number workers quit their jobs starting in 2021, to employees' greater focus on quality-of-life issues. And they say the pandemic brought these issues to light for many workers. Beyond the impact that had on the broader labor force, concerns about work conditions has resulted in a surge of union activism. There have been 263 strikes so far this year, according to a database kept by Cornell University, up 84% from the same period last year. And there have been 826 union elections at workplaces from January through July of this year, up 45% from the number held in the same period of 2021, according to data from the National Labor Relations Board, which oversees the votes. The 70% success rate by unions in those votes is far better than the 42% in the first seven months of 2021. Those surges in activity would never have happened without the non-economic issues coming front and center, according to union officials. \"That's definitely what's driving the voice of the workers around the country. It's not just pocketbook issues,\" said Fred Redmond, secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO. \"They want their voices heard. They're working horrendous schedules. Workers are finding out their bosses don't respect their voice, they don't respect them.\" Experts agree that the unions are finding newfound success because of worker anger about noneconomic issues. \"Unions are successful when they are building on things that workers are concerned about,\" said Alexander Colvin, dean of the school of industrial and labor relations at Cornell University. \"The scheduling, the health and safety concerns, those are very important he added. \"There's certainly an opportunity for the unions there.\" And experts say these issues are a good sign for continued union strength going forward. \"The rising of importance of the noneconomic issues ... suggests a rebirth of the labor movement,\" said Todd Vachon, a professor of labor studies at Rutgers University. \"Economic demand for labor will ebb and flow.

Are growing more confident? We'll get those answers this week when the latest consumer and producer price indexes as well as retail sales figures for August all come out. The numbers could change the calculus for the Federal Reserve, which is guaranteed to raise interest rates again at its next policy meeting on September 21. The question is, by how much? Traders are still predicting another three-quarters of a percentage point, or , hike, the third straight move of that size. And Fed chair Jerome Powell said that \"the Fed has, and accepts, responsibility for price stability. We need to act right now.\" But could the odds of another huge rate hike edge lower if inflation data continues to suggest that \"price stability\" might finally be closer to reality? The consumer price index (CPI) numbers come out Tuesday morning while producer price index (PPI) figures will be released Wednesday. Keep in mind that at the end of July, the market was pricing in just a 28% probability of a 75 basis point hike in September. Investors now think there's an 88% chance of another super-sized hike, Economists are currently forecasting that consumer prices for August will fall slightly from July and that prices were up 8.1% over the past 12 months. Of course, 8.1% is still incredibly high by historical standards but it would be a notable slowdown from the June's 9.1% year-over-year spike in prices. \"We probably have seen the peak on inflation. Food and energy prices are coming down. There is more room to the downside,\" said Joe Kalish, chief global macro strategist with Ned Davis Research. Investors seem to begrudgingly accept the likelihood that the Fed will raise rates by 75 basis points again in a few weeks...regardless of what the August inflation data indicates. But traders are hoping that the September rate hike is the last one of such magnitude. Assuming the Fed boosts rates by three-quarters of a point on September 21, that would bring interest rates to a target range of 3% to 3.25%. Look at fed funds futures on the CME for November. As of midday Friday, investors were pricing in 70% odds of a half-point hike at the Fed's November 2 meeting ... to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%. There was just a 10% probability of a fourth straight 75 basis point increase, however, which could be one reason why stocks have rebounded so far in September following their August tumble. Wall Street is clearly betting that inflation trends will continue to head in the right direction. Economists also expect producer prices, the cost of goods at the wholesale level, to fall slightly in August. Forecasts are for a drop of 0.1% from July to August, following a 0.5% decrease from June to July. Producer prices surged 9.8% year-over-year in July but that's down from June's high water mark of 11.3%. Any further slowdown would likely be welcomed by the market, the Fed and consumers. That brings us to retail sales. Consumer spending figures for August are due out Thursday morning. The government reported last month that retail sales were up 10.3% year-over-year in July. It will be interesting to see if that rate of sales picked up in August or slowed down. The Fed is in a tough spot. It wants to put inflation pressures to rest and the way to do that is with big interest rate hikes. But the Fed would also like to avoid a recession if it can, which is why some are still hoping for a soft, or a . Powell also talked about rate hikes and inflation causing for the economy at his Jackson Hole speech last month. That could be an argument for the Fed to do smaller rate hikes...as long as inflation continues to cool. And that is the key point. Investors have to pay closer attention to the inflation data than whatever Powell or other Fed members are saying. The Fed remains data dependent, which is why rate hike odds are constantly in flux. \"There must be a convincing downward trend in inflation. We are not there yet,\" said David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth US, in a report Friday. The economy isn't the only thing in focus next week. Two software giants,  and  , will report their latest earnings. Investors will be watching for clues about the state of tech spending among big businesses. Shares of both companies have fallen this year, along with rest of the tech sector and broader market. Oracle is down nearly 15% while Adobe has plunged more than 30%. But analysts expect solid sales growth from both companies ... nearly 15% for Adobe from a year ago and an almost 20% increase from Oracle. One investment strategist said that big tech firms like Oracle and Adobe make sense for investors. \"We do own big techs that are much more mature and established,\" said Suzanne Hutchins, head of the real returns strategy and senior portfolio manager with Newton Investment Management. The results from Oracle and Adobe will also serve as a preview for the deluge of tech third quarter earnings that will come later in October. Solid results from these two could be a good sign for  ,  ,  and other cloud software firms. Still, the recent earnings from  , which was cautious about its guidance, could be a warning sign for both companies, according to Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager with Synovus Trust Company.

Who needs to print photos anymore?

More than 50% of photo prints made this year will come from a retail store, totaling about $786 million in sales, said David Haueter, a longtime photo industry analyst and the founder of consulting and market research firm Rise Above Research. Around 4.2 billion 4'' x 6\" prints alone will be developed at stores this year, he added. \"People aren't printing as much as they used to, but there are still people who like to print,\" said Haueter. Retro technology and older gadgets have in part because they allow people to unplug from the constant ping-ping-ping of their devices.

More than 8,000 Walgreens stores offer photo services, said Raghu Valata, Walgreens' senior director of digital commerce strategy and planning. \"Holidays tend to be a busy time for our photo business, with the highest foot traffic generally seen in December,\" Valata said. Though drug stores and other retailers have kept their photo services in stores, it's not the answer for every business:  and  have nixed them in recent years. Costco last year photo centers at all of its roughly 800 stores, that the \"continued decline of prints no longer requires on-site photo printing\" and that \"digital technologies allow consumers to do more with their photos.\" But at Walmart, by contrast, around 3,700 stores have Fujifilm photo kiosks \u2014 typically located within the store's electronics department and they're often put to use. It's a service that \"customers utilize quite regularly,\" a Walmart spokesperson said, including people who may not have access to a computer to order prints online. \"We maintain a healthy business year-round.\""},

That was on full display during the company's earnings call Thursday night as he bemoaned New York City breakfasts, dunked on industry rivals and declared that anyone who thinks the United States isn't in a recession is \"crazy.\" While the mood was mostly upbeat \u2014 RH earnings for the second quarter beat expectations, and Friedman seemed pumped to join the call from RH Guesthouse, the company's brand new, ultra-luxury hotel in Manhattan's Meatpacking District \u2014 Friedman warned that third-quarter revenue could fall as much as 18% . That compares with 19% growth in the third quarter last year. \"I think the Fed finally really understands what they have to do. And it's not going to be pretty when interest rates go up the way they are,\" Friedman said.  shares initially slumped 1% on the grim outlook, but were up more than 5% Friday. Luxury brands tend to weather economic slowdowns better because they cater to wealthy people who are less deterred by higher borrowing costs. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise its key interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point \u2014 its third jumbo hike since June \u2014 later this month That's why you haven't seen, and likely will not see, heavy discounts or red-line Labor Day sales at RH, even if that means losing market share to competitors like West Elm or Wayfair. \"While everybody is, like, running around, trying to pick up the apples on the ground, we figured out how to build an apple-harvesting company,\" he said. \"It's just a different game we're playing.\" RH, formerly Restoration Hardware, has a market cap of more than $6.2 billion, and has made a hard pivot as a luxury lifestyle brand, with an emphasis on hospitality. RH Guesthouse, the company's new hotel, is certainly among the most expensive in city. There's no online booking, no photographs allowed, and no lobby. Also no pets or children. Rooms start at $3,500 a night and suites start at $7,500 a night. The restaurant in the space will be RH's 15th. That's where, according to Friedman, guests can find a good breakfast \u2014 something that he claims, rather controversially, is lacking in fair Gotham. \"You usually can't find good breakfast in this town.

The hotel \u2014 its website takes issue with that word, prominently declaring \"this is not a hotel\" but rather \"our house\" \u2014 is so exclusive Friedman even refused to let images of the rooms appear in print. For a Wall Street Journal preview, the CEO agreed only to a photo of Friedman appears confident in his long-term strategy, saying the company is well-prepared to ride out the next year of economic turmoil. \"We've been through storms before ... We've been through the Great Recession before,\" he said. \"A lot of other people are going to stumble and fall.\" And while economists are divided over whether the US is in a recession or not \u2014 officially, recessions are determined by a group of economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research \u2014 Friedman believes the downturn is already well under way. \"Anybody who thinks we're not in a recession is crazy,\" Friedman told analysts. \"The housing market is in a recession, and it's just getting started.

I've visited the Wall of Wind on the Florida International University (FIU) campus many times. It is a wall of enormous fans inside a big warehouse-type building that can blow air up to 160 mph, which would be a Category 5 hurricane, to test infrastructure and research the power of wind. However, in our changing climate, sadly, 160 mph isn't strong enough. So, the National Science Foundation (NSF) just awarded a $12.8 million Extreme Events Institute for the design of a full-scale testing facility capable of producing winds of 200 mph, along with a water basin to simulate storm surge and wave action in extreme winds. FIU will be able to build a house under the current building codes, start up the fans and see if it can withstand 200 mph winds. Will the roof detach? Will the house still be standing at all? The water basin will look like an enormous pool. It will also be able to simulate different coastlines. Storm surge tends to be worse when the coastlines are more shallow like along the Florida Panhandle. The facility will be able to simulate all of it. \"If you think about trying to future-proof, a changing hazard environment, a hazard scape, the US hazard scape with climate change, the past is not much of a guide. In fact, it can be deceiving,\" said Dr. Richard Olson, director of the Extreme Events Institute at FIU. \"So, if we're going to future-proof, we need to be able to research and test what future hazard events will look like. You can't future-proof in a changing environment if you're looking backwards.\" It's true. Climate change is showing us r, moving slower and are holding more water than ever before. They are also rapidly intensifying, meaning the winds are increasing at least 35 mph in a 24-hour period. In 2021, five hurricanes in the Atlantic rapidly intensified. And in 2020, TEN Atlantic hurricanes rapidly intensified. of those storms. \"Dorian in 2019 is the one that totally got my attention,\" said Olson. \"It hit 185 mph over the Bahamas, and until the last day and a half, it was heading straight up Eighth Street in Miami.\" Dorian ended up causing across Abaco and Grand Bahama. \"The scientific consensus is that we're going to see more intense storms, so we have to research and test for more intense storms,\" said Olson. \"Otherwise, nature's going to keep hitting us with harder stuff than we're ready for.\" The facility will be the first of its kind in the world to combine wind speeds of greater magnitude along with a water component. Eventually the facility will be able to test how different types of infrastructure, roads, bridges will all respond with a Category 6 storm. \"We can start putting all of these components together to get a much better picture of what nature is going to be hitting us with,\" says Olson. Yes, I realized I just referred to it as a Category 6 storm. And it might make some of you a little uncomfortable. To be honest, it bothers me a little bit too. But to be fair, if you look at the for the hurricanes, they are all -- more or less -- in about 20 mph increments. When a Category 5 hurricane's wind speeds start at 157 mph, and we see storms with maximum sustained winds of 180 mph, it's a number that makes me go pale. Since 2010, there have been 18 storms globally with recorded wind speeds of at least 178 mph at some point during their life span. and were two storms in the Atlantic to meet the threshold. It begs the question, especially for messaging purposes, do these types of storms need a special name? Category 6? Super-hurricane? Just something to put an exclamation point on how intense these specific storms are. But the truth of the matter is, most people who die in hurricanes don't die from wind, but from water. I reached out to my friend, Dennis Feltgen, the public affairs officer at the National Hurricane Center (NHC) about whether he thought there would ever be a day in our future we would see a Category 6, and here is what he had to say: I do agree with Dennis, but I also think as storms become stronger, wetter and slower, there might be a day the category system evolves from what it is now, just as the EF scale or Fujita scale was in 2007. And by the way, the same facility will also test tornado and thunderstorm winds. There are a few research facilities studying extreme winds. Watch below to see what 100 mph winds can do to a house. \"I think the interaction between the various components of hurricanes, the waves, the flooding, the currents, and the wind, the debris, all of that, it's very important to simulate that as practically as possible,\" said Dr. Arindam Gan Chowdhury, professor of environmental engineering at FIU. \"Everything is not possible to replicate Mother Nature.

{"url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/26/weather/tornado-facts-formation-supercell/index.html", "title": "This is how a thunderstorm produces a tornado", "paragraphs": " Tornadoes are one of Earth's most violent forces of nature. They have occurred in all 50 states and have been spotted throughout the year. While they are most common in the United States, tornadoes can occur all over the globe. While great strides have been made in the study of tornadoes, there's still so much we don't know about them. They have been studied immensely during the last few decades to learn what causes them and how they form. CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller, who is also a storm chaser, has been following and studying these storms since 2005. \"Something you learn from studying tornadoes, especially in the field, is that there is no perfect formula for forming a tornado -- every storm is unique,\" says Miller. \"Sometimes, it may appear that a storm is in a perfect environment for a tornado to form, yet it never does. Conversely, tornadoes frequently form in marginal environments where it seems like one or more 'ingredients' to storm formation is missing or lacking,\" says Miller. While there's no perfect formula as to which storms will produce tornadoes, there's commonality in the anatomy of the systems that result in tornadoes. There are even signs you can see that will help you understand the life cycle of a developing storm that could produce a tornado. As warm air rises, clouds begin to grow taller and taller. This is the developing phase of the thunderstorm. You can see fluffy white cumulus clouds grow taller with your own eyes. This is before you see rain or hear thunder. As the clouds grow, you will notice the bottom of the cloud darkening. You will many times see the very top of the cloud flattening out, creating an anvil shape that protrudes from the top of the cloud. This indicates very cold air at the top of the cloud and could be a precursor to the possibility of hail. As the storm matures, it could become what's known as a supercell. A supercell is a rotating thunderstorm. \"Nearly all supercells produce some sort of severe weather (large hail or damaging winds) but only 30 percent or less produce tornadoes,\" says the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. During this mature phase of the thunderstorm or supercell; heavy rain, lightning, hail and very strong winds are expected. Sometimes, you will feel a strong gust of wind a few moments before the rain arrives. This is called a gust front. This is caused by cool air being forced down from the storm cloud. When the cold air hits the ground, it spreads out quickly, ahead of the storm. This is a sure sign that a storm is near. Tornadoes are usually formed from supercells. These supercells develop when there are several ingredients in place to help them thrive: instability, lift and wind shear. Within the supercell, wind shear becomes a crucial component to the storms development. Shear is when winds change directions with height. This creates spin within the thunderstorm cloud. Another force that's acting inside the supercel is a downdraft. This is an area of drier air that is pushed down from the storm. As it's forced down, it wraps around the backside of the storm. The updrafts and downdrafts work in tandem to pull the horizontal column of air down to form the tornado. This vertical column of air is called a funnel cloud until it touches the ground -- at that point it becomes a tornado. \"The most telltale sign that a tornado could be forming, when you are looking at a close-range severe thunderstorm, is the 'wall cloud,'\" says Miller. The wall cloud is a lowering of the cloud base that will lead to the vortex, or spinning of air. When this rotating column of air touches the ground, a tornado has formed. The presence of a wall cloud doesn't always mean a tornado will form, but it certainly ups the odds. \"You will know you are looking at a wall cloud because it will hang noticeably lower than the rest of the thunderstorm and you may notice it is rotating if you look closely,\" says Miller. Most tornadoes are relatively small and short-lived, and can still be dangerous and cause damage. However, more violent tornadoes can be more than a mile wide and stay on the ground for more than an hour. This is because they have much more momentum than the smaller tornadoes, making them harder to stop. Miller has witnessed roughly 15-20 tornadoes during his years storm chasing. \"There is no denying that there is a certain amount of excitement that comes from seeing a tornado when you are set out with the intent of seeing one,\" says Miller. \"At the same time, you are balancing that excitement with a sizable amount of anxiety and concern over what the tornado could do, especially if there are residents in the immediate path of the storm. As someone who spent years studying, and many more years reporting on, tornadoes, it still gets all my nerves firing when you see a tornado in person.\" The smaller tornadoes have winds of 60-110 mph, while the more violent tornadoes can have winds from 160 to more than 200 miles per hour. The strongest winds ever recorded on Earth were from a tornado, on at more than  CNN's Jackson Dill and CNN meteorologist Haley Brink contributed to this report"},

All the homes are just destroyed,\" Tezeno recounted. She took a long pause; the wound was as fresh as it was that August day in 2020. Tezeno arrived at her Cameron Parish neighborhood fearing the worst, and amid the rubble, there stood her home. It looked unscathed. But Tezeno's feelings of hope were quickly dashed when she opened the door. Inside, it was a very different story. \"The back was all blown out. The AC unit flew off the back of our house. All the siding came off the house, my back porch on my house with two bedrooms and the bathrooms were all caved in,\" Tezeno told CNN. For two years, Tezeno -- a single mother -- and her four children have not been able to move back in as the home gets repaired. She's been living with relatives as she balances what seems like three full-time jobs: her actual full-time job, raising her family, and endlessly dealing with insurance companies. \"This whole thing has taken an emotional toll on me,\" she admitted. Tezeno and her family are preparing to move back in a matter of weeks, which also happens to be right in time for the start of the hurricane season. NOAA is predicting , with 6-10 hurricanes and 3-6 major storms (Category 3 or higher). According to Colorado State University, the chances of Louisiana getting hit with a named storm within 50 miles this season are 84%. \"Oh Jesus, keep us spared,\" Tezeno sighed. As Tezeno and her fellow Louisianans try to mentally prepare for hurricanes yet to come, two years after Laura, Lake Charles -- 45 miles north of Cameron Parish -- still looks like a blue patchwork quilt. \"I still see blue tarps out there, there are plenty of homes and businesses that are still not completely put back together,\" Lake Charles National Weather Service meteorologist Stephen Corbani observed. \"There is a literal PTSD out there in the community,\" explained Lake Charles Mayor Nic Hunter. \"It's a visceral thing.\" The storm cost more than a billion dollars in the state of Louisiana alone, with more than 44,000 households approved by to receive housing assistance. According to , there are still more than 2,000 cases still open in the Lake Charles area -- that's 2,000 families still working to rebuild. \"We have some homes that literally have not been touched since Hurricane Laura,\" Hunter noted. But he told CNN they just got word . \"Though it has taken far too long, there is over a billion dollars in federal aid that has been allocated for hurricanes Laura and Delta. We are immensely thankful for that,\" he added. The previous two hurricane seasons have been particularly cruel for Louisiana. In 2020, , and in 2021, , a Category 4 behemoth, battered the southeastern part of the state on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. The poundings have left residents wary of what lies ahead. \"Certainly, as we approach hurricane season, locals are just a bit more on edge than they were prior to 2020,\" Hunter acknowledged. While it is impossible to know exactly where these storms will make landfall, the forecasts are grim. \"Looking at some of the climate signals that are out there, like , it seems like we're in store for another above normal season, just in terms of numbers and activity across the Atlantic basin,\" Carboni projected. Lake Charles is home for Carboni too, and like Tezeno, he hopes this year's busy season doesn't end up affecting his area, still so vulnerable from two seasons ago. \"The last thing we need would be for another hurricane to affect this area,\" Carboni remarked. If you are in a hurricane zone and are preparing for the upcoming season, hopefully you have a plan for you and your family, as well as a . After talking to Tezeno, though, she expressed some advice I think many times gets overlooked. \"Write down everything that you have. I don't care if it's minor and take pictures of everything that you can and check your policy,\" she urged. She also recommended securing your home if you evacuate. She recalled many of her neighbors fled their homes, only to come back and find it structurally damaged AND everything inside looted. Lastly, she advised having some sort of hurricane savings account. \"Have as much as you can to take care of yourself without relying on insurance, because sometimes they are not as quick to come to your aid as you think.\""},

Cayette, who uses a wheelchair, called parish officials for help. They never came. Parish officials, however, told CNN that they did not receive calls that match Cayette's situation, adding that the government is \"by law, not allowed to enter or conduct work on private property unless it is an emergency life saving measure.\" It wasn't until two days later when a group of volunteers from New Orleans came to saw and remove the trees that he was able to go outside. \"I've seen it all,\" Cayette, a retired industry worker, told CNN. \"After Hurricane Betsy in 1965, the chemical plants started building and operating. A lot of them. It all changed.\" About 50 miles away in St. John the Baptist Parish, Robert Taylor Jr., executive director of Concerned Citizens of St. John, said many residents were trapped in their attics after the storm while others witnessed their roofs being ripped off by Ida. The lack of after the hurricane, Taylor said, is just another example of the neglect the community has long suffered. Residents say the government failed to prepare the community for the storm by not issuing an evacuation order earlier or assisting poor and vulnerable residents who could not manage to flee their homes, like Cayette. \"The government is obviously failing us and not protecting us,\" said Taylor, who evacuated from St. John before Hurricane Ida hit. \"And this just pushed it over the top.\" The predominantly Black community of St. John and the nearly majority Black population of St. James sit at the heart of Louisiana's \"Cancer Alley,\" the 85-mile stretch between New Orleans and Baton Rouge that's home to more than 150 chemical plants and oil refineries. According to the Environmental Protection Agency's 2019 , \u2014 census areas that typically contain 600 to 3,000 people \u2014 with the country's estimated highest cancer risks are in St. John. Until recently, Cayette, who has lived in the region for 70 years and previously worked at a nearby petrochemical plant, never connected the growth of the chemical industry to the region's suddenly high cancer rates. But then his wife died of breast cancer a few years ago -- and he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer on top of his diabetes. Now, he lives alone with the sight of industrial facilities looming outside his window. \"I was mad and disappointed at the government,\" Cayette said about the lack of response after Ida. \"What concerned me even more is that I'm disabled, but they couldn't come to help.\" For decades, scientists have claimed the planet has been rapidly warming because of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from the burning of fossil fuels. Days after Ida ravaged the homes of and Mississippi, the EPA concluding that racial and ethnic minority communities disproportionately suffer the most severe consequences of climate change, indicating they are the least able to prepare for, and recover from, extreme climate events such as pollution, flooding and heat waves. If the planet reaches the critical warming threshold of 2 degrees Celsius -- which most unless they drastically cut emitting greenhouse gases from fossil fuels -- the report warns that Black people are projected to face the worst impacts of the climate crisis. \"It's absolutely an insult that the companies that are responsible for this are also the ones that are driving climate change,\" Naomi Yoder, staff scientist at the Healthy Gulf, a group working to restore natural resources in the region, told CNN. \"They're also one of the biggest drivers of land loss in Louisiana, which makes the effects of hurricanes worse.\" The coronavirus pandemic has also hit both parishes especially hard. In April 2020, St. John had the highest death rate per capita for Covid-19 in the United States, surpassing even the most densely populated urban hotspots. Around that time in St. James, the Covid-19 death rate was also than the overall national death rate. More than a year later, with the pandemic persisting, Category 4 Hurricane Ida threw the area's high cancer and Covid-19 rates and underlying environmental health hazards, which come from the area's rampant pollution from fossil fuel industries, into harsh relief. \"It's just risk on top of risk on top of risk,\" Kimberly Terrell, director of community engagement at the Tulane University Environmental Law Clinic, told CNN. \"There's always air pollution coming out of industrial facilities, and these communities have been burdened with that for decades.\" The Rev. Lionel Murphy, pastor of Tchoupitoulas Chapel in St. John, said the storm left devastating damage to his church along with homes and other buildings in the parish, exacerbating the emotional and physical toll that air pollution and health disparities have placed on communities. \"If only we can get some attention,\" Murphy said, referring to public officials and emergency responders. \"The people are going to leave and come back, but this storm aggravates so much else because Covid is pretty strong in St. John.\" In the early months of the pandemic, Harvard's school of public health released a showing a link between fine particulate matter, also known as PM 2.5 pollution, and increased mortality rates from Covid-19. Terrell wanted to know what that meant for Louisiana, particularly in Cancer Alley. After scraping the raw data from the Harvard study and performing her own analysis, she found that the highest death rates from Covid-19 and a majority of PM 2.5 concentrations were in Cancer Alley. Ida added another layer of affliction by destroying houses and forcing residents to emergency shelters or relatives' homes, where they may be clustered together with potential for increased Covid-19 transmission. \"It seems like these communities are just continually burdened with risks that they didn't ask for, and don't deserve to be burdened with,\" Terrell said. The current 7-day average is more than 42 new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 in St. John and more than 177 new cases per 100,000 in St. James, according to . The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention categorizes St. John and St. James as a community with high levels of Covid-19 transmission. Taylor said he worries that residents who have been sickened by cancer as well as Covid-19 won't get the medical care they need after having to evacuate because of Ida's impacts. Some are being transported to shelters where they could potentially spread Covid-19 or even contract it, he said, echoing Terrell's concern. Prior to Ida, of residents in St. James Parish and St. John Parish were living below the poverty line, according to Census data. \"This is a mess,\" Taylor told CNN. \"I don't see how poor people are expected to survive this.\" The proliferation of petrochemical facilities and oil refineries throughout Cancer Alley has become a familiar sight to residents along the industrial corridor. Cayette said he remembers industrial facilities emerging after Category 4 Hurricane Betsy pummeled the region in 1965. But it was only recently that residents began to realize the invisible danger the industry caused on public health and the ironic effects it has on the climate. When a hurricane is barreling toward an industry-heavy region, petrochemical facilities and oil refineries typically begin to shutter their plants, which involves burning anywhere from hundreds to of hazardous materials. As part of emergency shutdown procedures, these facilities emit or burn various unprocessed chemicals and gases through a process known as flaring. Oftentimes, Yoder said, the emissions continue to escape even after the hurricane has knocked out power lines. \"This is not something new to these communities, and it's not necessarily even unique to a disaster situation,\" Terrell said of refineries emitting toxic compounds. \"It seems like consistently the people who are breathing these toxins are the last to find out about it.\" In St. Charles Parish, for instance, a Shell Norco manufacturing complex has been spewing residual gases as residents pick through the rubble of Hurricane Ida's aftermath. After the storm, the EPA contacted Shell about the excessive smoke and reports of noxious gas coming out of its refinery. In a report, that Shell is conducting \"community air monitoring\" and \"looking at all options to try to reduce emissions to flare.\" \"While the site is safe and secure, we are experiencing elevated flaring due to a lack of steam generation,\" Curtis Smith, a Shell spokesperson, told CNN. \"Crews are working around the clock to complete repairs and we are making good progress on minimizing flaring until power is restored.\" In St. James Parish, residents like Sharon Lavigne have been fighting new petrochemical plants attempting to set up shop in their community. Five years ago, Lavigne was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis. Blood tests revealed that she had aluminum inside her body, which she later blamed on the slew of industrial facilities after attending a few environmental justice workshops. Angered by what she learned about the industry growing in her backyard, Lavigne founded RISE St. James, a faith-based environmental justice group trying to stop any new industrial development in Cancer Alley, which Cayette is also a member of. One of their was against the Taiwanese plastics manufacturer Formosa, which was set to build a in St. James Parish. Not only do Formosa's own that their mammoth facility could emit more of the cancer-causing compound than just about any other facility in the country, but their chosen location also happens to sit on two former 19th-century sugarcane plantations and a , according to a filed against the facility. \"My grandparents lived on this land. They bought this land and lived on it,\" Lavigne told CNN. \"And then when I got married, I built a house on this land.\" And while Formosa tried to push ahead with its construction during the pandemic, RISE St. James fought hard to block the company, delaying the construction further. The US Army Corps of Engineers early this year ordered Formosa to conduct a new environmental review of the petrochemical facility, thanks to legal complaints, protests and lawsuits like RISE St. James. While the battle to block the multibillion-dollar facility isn't over, Hurricane Ida added to the community's problems. The storm tore Lavigne's roof and caused her ceiling to collapse, just like it did to many other houses in the parish. \"So many of us suffered damages from Ida,\" Lavigne said, \"so after RISE members rebuild, we're going to help the rest of the community.\" Cancer Alley has faced many disasters, but none as challenging as a hurricane, air pollution and pandemic happening at once. To Cayette and Lavigne, living next to industrial facilities is a death sentence. It may take years for the community to recover, but Lavigne said they've been victorious before. As long as the fossil fuel industry continues to warm the planet and pollute their backyards, she said grassroots organizations will keep fighting. \"People tell me they're glad we're fighting the industry,\" she said. \"Many tell me they can't be out there to help me, but they're praying for me. That was nice.\""},
{"url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/19/weather/weather-hurricane-hunter-flights/index.html", "title": "Here's why hurricane hunters fly their planes in weird patterns into storms", "paragraphs": " The second half of hurricane season is here and there have already been to keep hurricane hunters busy. But have you ever noticed hurricane hunters' flight patterns shown by meteorologists on TV look like random, odd shapes? Those flight patterns may look like boxes or stars, but they serve specific purposes for each individual storm. Hurricane hunters don't fly away from these storms like commercial airlines do. They fly directly into them, but they don't just fly into and around the storms randomly. There is a method to the madness. There are two distinctive groups of hurricane hunters, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the US Air Force Reserve (USAF). Both organizations fly missions into tropical disturbances in order to record invaluable data used by forecasters at the National Hurricane Center (NHC). For the Hurricane Hunters, there are two main types of missions flown, fixed and invest. Fixed missions are designated for systems that meet tropical cyclone qualifications, such as tropical depressions, tropical storms, and hurricanes. The main objective is to mark the center of circulation, monitor winds speeds and pressure changes, and other variables that are tricky for satellites in space to measure in full detail. For fixed missions, 'Alpha' is most common flight pattern used to collect data in a tropical cyclone. \"The Alpha pattern is the standard profile we fly for fix missions so it's the one people are most familiar with seeing from us,\" , meteorologist and aerial reconnaissance weather officer with the Air Force Reserve's , said. \"The pattern consists of two legs flown at intercardinal directions, and when complete, looks a lot like the Greek Alpha symbol when including the crossleg.\" Cardinal directions are the standard points on a compass: north, south, east, and west. Intercardinal directions are the diagonal points in between: northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest. Interestingly, the bigger, stronger storms tend to be the \"easier\" ones to fly in. \"From my perspective as the onboard meteorologist, the Alpha pattern is the \"easiest\" to fly. Because we normally fly those on stronger storms, there's not a lot of question where the storm center is,\" DeHart said. \"The flights can be rough of course, but at the end of the day we just go fly through the storm center, collect the data, and send it to NHC.\" The primary objective of an invest mission is to determine if a system meets the definition of a tropical cyclone; storms that do not yet have a name or any real tropical structure characteristics. For invest missions, the NHC will often send estimated coordinates of where they believe the center of circulation is, which is where the missions will target for their starting point. However, invest missions by nature have to be a bit more flexible for flight patterns, simply because there are so many unknowns with these types of storms. \"We never know what we're going to find, yet we always have to be thinking two or three steps ahead. So that really makes us need to think about the meteorology [in each particular storm],\" DeHart said. \"Is it a closed low or an open wave? Maybe it's closed but just elongated? Is it battling shear? Are there several smaller swirls competing to be the main circulation center? Weak storms and invests can be very tricky and require a lot of thinking on our toes.\" Air Force Hurricane Hunters have a to choose from for invest missions: X, Delta, and Box, just to name a few. DeHart explains the missions are ideal for the weaker, more uncertain storms. While the X pattern may resemble the Alpha pattern, it is flown at much lower altitudes, usually around 500 to 1,000 feet. \"Once a system becomes a tropical storm or hurricane, the hurricane hunters begin flying at higher altitudes, ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 feet depending on the severity of the storm,\" said Jessica Kendziorek, public affairs operations chief with the USAF 403rd Wing. Flight levels for the Delta and Box patterns are usually at or below 5,000 ft absolute altitude. \"The Delta and Box patterns are similar in that we'll fly around the periphery of the forecast center seeing if we can observe winds in all four quadrants of the storm that would indicate a closed circulation. If we find a closed circulation, we can confidently go [find] the center; if not, we'll continue the mission in 'invest mode',\" DeHart said. NOAA Hurricane Hunters also fly operational fixed and invest missions (though the names may be different), but they usually have more research-oriented objectives. They fly many unique , with different types of aircraft, depending on what type of mission is assigned. Hurricane Hunters also fly a third type of mission, which the Air Force rarely flies, according to DeHart, called synoptic missions. For fixed missions NOAA often flies a Figure 4, Rotated Figure 4 pattern, or a Butterfly pattern. \"The Butterfly and Figure 4 patterns flown by the WP-3D through the storm are typically the ones used to [find] the center of circulation,\" said Jonathan Shannon, public affairs specialist for the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center Office of Marine and Aviation Operations. The Rotated Figure 4 pattern is as it sounds; the Figure 4 pattern turned on side. \"The goal with every flight is to gather data all around the center of the storm, and those patterns allow us to efficiently fly through a storm's various quadrants,\" Nick Underwood, NOAA Hurricane Hunter, said. \"This data helps with predicting a storm's intensity, as well as determining exactly where the center is.\" For invest missions, the Lawnmower and Square Spiral patterns are flown, to determine if there are actual tropical characteristics associated with the area in which they are investigating. \"The Lawnmower Pattern allows us to map out a large area when we don't have a center to aim for,\" Paul Flaherty, science branch chief at NOAA's Aircraft Operations Center, said. \"Once we are able to map a full circulation (usually by finding a west wind), we'll shift back to Figure 4's based on that newly identified center position.\" The Square Spiral pattern is a survey mission meant to supply observations on the structure and characteristics including information about the vortex center, if it exists. There is a unique third type of mission flight pattern, often used to sample the surrounding atmosphere which helps forecasters know the direction the storm is likely to go. The Star 1 pattern focuses on a scan of the outer edges of the system. The closely-related Star 2 pattern also does an outer scan of the system, while also adding in a circumference loop near the center of circulation. Recently, NOAA's Gulfstream IV flew a Star-2 pattern around Hurricane Larry, to investigate outflow patterns from the storm and better determine where the storm was headed. \"The flight pattern you'll typically see from our Gulfstream IV is a circumnavigation of the storm itself, as well as sampling of the atmosphere around and ahead of the storm,\" Underwood said. \"This data helps with predicting the storm's track.\" Regardless of which entity is flying, the operational missions are the backbone for the National Hurricane Center, tasked with providing essential life-saving information about a storm. The NHC takes the data and uses it to issue guidance and advisories to the public, so people know whether Elsa or Ida or Nicholas are still tropical storms or have become hurricanes. We ended 2020 with a 30 named storms in the Atlantic basin and if this season is anything like last year, we have a long way to go."},

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center on Tuesday forecast 14 to 21 named storms, six to 10 hurricanes and three to six major hurricanes -- of Category 3 strength or greater. The 2020 and 2021 seasons both exhausted the hurricane name list and broke records. No one can say for sure if this year will be similar, but in early April, , which were right in line with what NOAA is forecasting. The CSU forecast called for 19 named storms, nine hurricanes and four major storms. After back-to-back years of using all the hurricane names and resorting to the Greek alphabet, the World Meteorological Organization decided to do away with using the Greek alphabet and to be used if all the hurricane names are exhausted once again. Of course it's impossible to know how many of those storms will make landfall along the US coast, or where the largest storms will develop. However, during the announcement, NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad recognized that the current hurricane cycle for the Atlantic is a busy one. \"If you go back two years, the 2020 hurricane season broke records across the board and it's the most active season on record with 30 named storms,\" said Spinrad. \"The 2021 hurricane season, which is the third most active year on record in terms of names of storms brought us 21 named storms with impacts, ranging from the Appalachian Mountains all the way to New England, resulting in over $78.5 billion in US damage.\" There are several contributing factors that play into a \"busy\" hurricane season. \"We are in an active period,\" said Spinrad. \"There are certain ingredients that drive the intensity and the frequency of hurricanes.\" One is the existing in the equatorial Pacific. This phenomenon creates cooler-than-average ocean temperatures around the equator in the Pacific and results in weather impacts around the globe. La Ni\u00f1a presents favorable conditions for hurricanes -- in contrast to that of El Ni\u00f1o. Hurricane seasons under El Ni\u00f1o conditions are known for upper-level wind patterns across the Caribbean that tear hurricanes apart as they try to form, making the seasons less active. Another reason for the above-normal forecast is the location of what's called the \"Gulf Loop Current.\" This current is \"a 600-foot-deep river of hot Caribbean water that travels between Cancun, Mexico and western Cuba into the Gulf,\" said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. This loop current is flowing farther north now, forcing warm water at deeper levels of the ocean to travel closer to the coastal areas along the Gulf of Mexico. \"The warm water is simply too deep and the hurricane has an unlimited supply of hot water for intensification,\" said Myers. Forecasters are comparing the position of the loop current with where it was placed in the record-breaking 2005 season -- when Hurricanes Katrina and Rita both made landfall. \"Yes, the loop current does look like 2005,\" said Matthew Rosencrans, lead hurricane season outlook forecaster with NOAA's Climate Prediction Center. \"But it depends if a storm actually moves over that loop current and forecasting the specific track of storms is not something we can do beyond a week time frame,\" Rosencrans added. During the 2021 hurricane season, eight storms made landfall along the US Gulf Coast and in 2020 six made landfall along the Gulf. In 2020, and both slammed into southwest Louisiana, making landfall roughly 15 miles apart. \"In 2021, ripped through Southeast Louisiana, then caused more . \"Hurricane Ida spanned nine states, demonstrating that anyone can be in the direct path of a hurricane and in danger from the remnants of a storm system,\" said FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. \"It's important for everyone to understand their risk.\""},

We had several this year that brought , staggering to the mountains in the west, and even . An atmospheric river is a long, narrow region in the atmosphere that can transport moisture thousands of miles, like a fire hose in the sky. We talk a lot about them in the West because large-scale storm systems bring the region up to 40% of their yearly rainfall. But we started wondering: Is there anywhere else where these happen? Apparently, atmospheric rivers also occur in the eastern US, unleashing a river of moisture like what we will see this week. The reason East Coast atmospheric rivers aren't talked about much isn't because they are rare. In fact, they are quite common. \"Atmospheric rivers are more frequent on the East Coast than they are on the West Coast,\" said Jason Cordeira, Associate Professor of Meteorology at Plymouth State University. \"They're just not as impactful and don't usually produce as much rainfall.\" While Cordeira noted it is tough to give an exact number of how many atmospheric rivers impact the East every year, he says a rough estimate would be anywhere from 80-100 per year! WOW. The West gets about half that number of atmospheric rivers each year, yet they account for double the annual rainfall percentage. \"The West Coast is a much more arid climate. And they usually get precipitation during just half of the year,\" Cordeira pointed out. The East Coast accumulates its annual rainfall from several sources: afternoon storms, cold fronts and hurricanes, which can bring MUCH higher rain amounts than an atmospheric river. \"Some of the strongest atmospheric river events that are perfectly oriented, can produce 6-8 inches of rain,\" Cordeira reported. \"Those totals are dwarfed by the amount of rainfall that we can get from a hurricane.\" Some recent hurricanes such as , have resulted in rainfall totals measured in FEET, not inches. This week's atmospheric river won't leave the footprint Harvey did by any stretch, but it could affect the same areas as Harvey. The Deep South will once again be hit by a series of storms this week, along with the Plains, the Rockies and the Pacific Northwest. So, needless to say, this week's weather will be much more far-reaching. It has no doubt been a super active stretch of severe weather in the South and Southeast, as this is the fourth week in a row where active weather is affecting the same areas. However, as we get deeper into April and May, we should start to see the storm tracks shift a little farther north into what is traditionally, \"Tornado Alley,\" which is what we will begin to see this week. A series of storm systems will impact the US this week from coast to coast. It will bring everything from blizzard conditions to tornadoes to flash flooding, an exhausting week to say the least. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) has placed a Level 3 out of 5 \"enhanced risk\" of severe weather today for central Arkansas, however, anywhere from San Antonio to the Ohio Valley could see storms today. The extreme northeast of Texas, southeast Oklahoma and western and central Arkansas, including Little Rock, are under a tornado watch until 11 p.m. CT Monday. Large hail -- possibly greater than baseball size -- and wind gusts to 70 mph are also a concern for the area. While this is happening in the central part of the country, a robust system will be entering the Pacific Northwest, and will crisscross the country in dramatic fashion today, bringing heavy rain to the coastal areas of Washington, Oregon and California, and several feet of snow for the Cascades. \"This system will deepen as it moves farther inland, setting the stage for an intense late season winter storm to impact the Rockies and Northern Plains,\" noted the Weather Prediction Center (WPC). \"Over a foot of snow is likely to accumulate between eastern Montana and central North Dakota on Tuesday.\" Blizzard warnings are in effect for portions of the Dakotas and Montana from Tuesday through Thursday. \"Total snow accumulations between 12 and 24 inches [are forecast],\" said the National Weather Service (NWS) office in Bismarck. \"Winds gusting as high as 50 mph [are also possible].\" The heavy snow and high winds will make travel nearly impossible for those areas due to whiteout conditions and will also create avalanche dangers. Many of the western mountain ranges have some sort of avalanche danger today, so be sure to check before heading out, especially in the backcountry. We wrote a story earlier in the season about what causes extreme avalanche dangers and why you only have about 15-30 minutes to be found alive after burial. Click to read more. After the system blankets the West with its late-season dump of snow, the storm will amplify as it heads east. It will combine with the available moisture provided by the atmospheric river we talked about and will result in the perfect setup for severe weather. The tornado threat will be even stronger for Tuesday and Wednesday in the midsection of the country. But the storms will be impacting areas much farther north than the previous rounds of severe weather we have seen during the last three weeks. Tuesday there is again a Level 3 out of 5 \"enhanced\" risk of severe storms from Dallas to Omaha, which includes more than 16 million people. While it is the area with the highest likelihood of storms, nearly 40 million people will have some possibility of seeing storms. \"Any thunderstorms that can develop in this very favorable thermodynamic environment will likely become severe quickly,\" the SPC advised. They mentioned any (strong thunderstorm) will be capable of producing tornadoes, saying \"some of the tornadoes could be strong.\" By Wednesday, we enter Day Three of this multiday severe event. The main threat area will shift east with the third day of a Level 3 out of 5 \"enhanced risk\" of severe weather. The bullseye will be from northern Louisiana to the south side of Chicago and include places like Shreveport, Little Rock, Memphis, St. Louis, and Indianapolis. \"Large to very large hail, damaging winds and tornadoes will all be possible,\" said the SPC. \"Strong tornadoes may occur.\" Dallas, Houston, New Orleans, and Chicago could all see storms as well. The good news is the severe threat will be over in time for Easter weekend. We could still see some lingering showers in the eastern half of the country, and some mountain snow in the Rockies, which could affect egg hunts and sunrise services. While things could change between now and then, right now the SPC doesn't have any areas highlighted for severe weather during Easter weekend as of now. As if severe storms and blizzard conditions weren't enough of a headline this week, extremely cold air will follow the front, plunging overnight temperatures into the single digits is forecast for portions of the northern Plains. \"Low temperatures in the single digits are possible and this could cause issues,\" said the NWS office in Billings. \"Do not be deceived by the sun, it is going to be fighting a very cold airmass.\" And as the climate crisis continues to change the dynamics of our weather, expect atmospheric rivers to become more intense as well. \"It's expected that as the air temperatures increase, the air can hold more water vapor and therefore any storms that are comprised of water vapor will have more of it,\" Cordeira explained. \"So, an atmospheric river, which is defined as a region of water vapor, will likely become more intense. Their frequency may not be more common, but their intensity could become larger.\" The drought-stricken West is getting even drier, according to the latest . \"Central Washington, Idaho, and northwest Montana also saw increases in drought extent or severity as short-term dryness continues to build upon long-term moisture deficits extending back to last year,\" according to the drought monitor. \"Many parts of southern Idaho, and the rest of the West, have set records for the driest three-month period (January to March) going back 100 years or more.\" Texas is also facing extreme drought with 95% of the state in some level of drought. At 26,000 square miles, Texas has more \"exceptional drought\" area than any other state, per the latest US Drought Monitor. The 26,000 square miles of exceptional drought is larger than the state of West Virginia (or more than three times the size of Massachusetts). The drought is only making fire conditions worse. From Texas to Kansas, there will be an extreme fire danger especially on Tuesday, as dry conditions and winds topping 50 mph will cover the area.

{"url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/14/weather/cloud-seeding-weather-modification-wxn/index.html", "title": "Scientists in the US are flying planes into clouds to make it snow more", "paragraphs": " With in drought, wouldn't it be nice if we could just \"make it rain\" or just \"make more snow?\" Well, certain parts of the country are doing just that, sort of. It's called cloud seeding, and it's nothing new. It's been around since the 1940s and countries all over the world have been doing it for various reasons , but it's a growing practice in the US, especially in the drought-stricken West. It's also surrounded with controversy. We spoke with Julie Gondzar who is the program manager for , who admits she gets lots of calls about what they are doing. Gondzar said some people say \"you're playing God,\" others say \"you are stealing moisture from the storm,\" making other areas drier than they normally would be, kind of like robbing Peter to pay Paul. There are also environmental factors to consider, as well as the cost-effectiveness versus the reward, which in the West these days water is liquid gold. \"Think about it like water storage, but in the winter on mountaintops,\" is how Gondzar described what cloud seeding is trying to achieve in her state, \"in a nutshell.\" Wyoming started cloud seeding in 2003 . Then eight seasons ago, they started doing it in an official capacity after their 10-year study proved it works. This season, they have gone on 28 flight missions for cloud seeding in Wyoming. She pointed out there are four weeks left in the season, so she is hoping for more opportunities before it winds down. When you compare Wyoming to other states such as Utah and North Dakota, who have been cloud seeding since the '70s and '80s, the state is fairly new to the game. Cloud seeding uses an already existing cloud, and injects silver iodide into the cloud, which adds tiny particles called ice nuclei (which water needs to freeze). Clouds, in basic terms, are a collection of water droplets and/or ice crystals floating in the sky. The nuclei help the cloud produce precipitation, and artificial ice nuclei help create more precipitation than the cloud would produce otherwise. It's done in two ways: One way is from the ground and the other is from the air, using silver iodide as the seeding agent. \"The ground-based generators kind of look like small weather stations, are like 20 feet tall, and they aerosolize into the atmosphere,\" Gondzar explained. \"But you have to wait for the right atmospheric conditions so that the plume goes over the mountain range.\" It makes seeding a little more tricky, because if the wind is blowing in the wrong direction, you'll completely miss your target. The most popular way is by plane, using flares. \"There are flares on the wing of the planes with silver iodide inside of cardboard casings and there are flares on the belly of the plane,\" Gondzar pointed out. Once the pilot flies into the storm, they ignite the cardboard casings full of silver iodide and \"seed\" the clouds. The result is more moisture in the cloud, resulting in more precipitation. The silver iodide \"is a natural salt compound,\" Gondzar emphasized. \"The reason it's used is because the geometric shape down to a molecular level is very similar to that of an ice crystal. And if you don't have that, you're not going to create additional ice crystals, which will then accumulate into snowflakes.\" But if you think you can bust the drought by using planes to modify the weather, Gondzar said think again. \"Cloud seeding does not fix the drought,\" Gondzar said. \"You can't break a drought with cloud seeding. It's a tool in the toolbox.\" Gondzar admitted while they know the method makes more snow than they would otherwise receive, it's difficult to know exactly how much more they are getting. \"There's evidence of it in radar and all kinds of papers written,\" Gondzar noted. \"The question that they're trying to answer now is how well does it work? And that's a difficult question to answer. Because there's an abstract piece of this. There's really no way to know how much snow a particular system would have produced.\" She knows cloud seeding doesn't generate a lot of additional snowfall, but every little bit helps these days. According to , some areas in the state are only at 60% of average for snowpack this season, and the window for additional snow is slowly closing as the season winds down. Since most of the West gets the majority of its water from snowmelt, she hopes what they are doing helps a tiny bit in the long term. \"It's a small incremental change over a long period of time. That's why consistency is important,\" Gondzar urged. She added at $28-$34 per acre foot, cloud seeding is relatively cheap. \"Those numbers tell us that this is an inexpensive way to help add water to the system. Essentially, we are creating a little bit of additional snowpack, that becomes additional streamflow in the spring and summer.\" But you need a cloud, to cloud seed. You can't just go out to the Mojave Desert and make it rain. \"This is not something that we can do out of thin air,\" Gondzar cautioned. \"The criteria is very specific for this to actually work.\" It can only be done within already existing clouds that were going to produce snow anyway and there has to be a certain temperature range. \"The silver iodide in the cloud is initiating that snow,\" Gondzar said. \"But you can't just make snow out of nothing. You have to have the supercooled liquid water in the cloud.\" She explained part of what made this year difficult was the much drier weather during the last month. There were fewer opportunities to cloud seed. \"A lot of people think it's manipulating the weather pattern,\" Gondzar remarked. \"We are essentially just playing with cloud dynamics and cloud physics, on a super, super-small scale.\" She is a meteorologist as well and points out the moisture from the weather systems come from much bigger areas like the Gulf of Mexico or the Pacific. \"There's always a huge stream of moisture that our systems are tapping into, and cloud seeding probably brings an additional one to 2% down to the surface.\" While Gondzar is confident cloud seeding doesn't steal snow from another area, some scientists disagree. Daniel Swain is a climate scientist at UCLA and spoke with my colleague and climate writer . He told her \"It is possible that you're actually stealing water from someone else when you do this, because it may be, at least on a regional basis, a zero-sum game where if water falls out of the cloud in one spot, it's even drier by the time it makes it downwind to the next watershed.\" He went on to ask, \"To what extent are you just shifting around the spatial distribution of precipitation during a scarcity period rather than actually causing it to rain or snow more overall?\" He believes water equity issues need to be researched more. Another note of controversy has been the safety of the chemicals used in cloud seeding. Gondzar stressed it is not made of harmful chemicals like some people claim. She pointed out they did lots of testing for before they started officially cloud seeding and could not find any traces of harmful amounts of silver. \"There's silver in natural background levels in the water in the soil everywhere, on the surface of the earth,\" Gondzar noted. \"So you already have a natural background level of silver, it's been really difficult to find anything beyond background levels.\" She said the amount of silver iodide used is only a few grams at a time. What she's hoping is a small price to pay for bigger rewards down the road. There have been climate concerns surrounding cloud seeding. Here's more from Ramirez, who reached out to a few scientists, to get their take on cloud seeding's climate angle. Although cloud seeding has been around for decades and is currently being operated in roughly 50 countries, many climate scientists remain skeptical of the technology's efficacy as well as the time and effort put into trying to manipulate weather. Swain pointed out it has been historically difficult to design scientific experiments to test the effectiveness of cloud seeding, leaving behind a trail of unclear, intangible evidence on what the benefits are. \"How do you know how much precipitation that might actually end up falling from that cloud occurred due to the seeding? Or how much would have fallen without the seeding?\" Swain told CNN. \"This isn't a setting where you can do a truly controlled experiment.\" Cloud seeding experiments typically deal with a narrow set of parameters, according to Swain, taking into account weather conditions including cloud cover, time of the day, and location. Additionally, the rapidly changing climate adds another layer to the list of variables. As the planet warms, weather patterns and clouds will constantly evolve, often in unexpected ways. That's what Sarah Tessendorf, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and other researchers from universities and an Idaho power company, set out to examine in 2017. , published in 2020 in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences, managed to quantify how effective cloud seeding is. Yet uncertainties still linger. During the cold winter months in 2017, the researchers flew aircraft to inject silver iodine, the seeding chemical used, into clouds over the Payette Basin in Idaho, while simultaneously using radars and models to measure its impact on snowfall. In three cloud-seeding events, the scientists identified \"unambiguous seeding patterns,\" in cold cloud decks not producing ice at all; but once seeded, ice crystals formed inside mirroring the same pattern the aircraft had flown. They were then able to track the formed ice and snow to the ground and measure how much additional snow fell from the seeded clouds. Despite the results, Tessendorf said more experiments need to be done to improve the technology for it to become a sweeping solution to the climate crisis. The amount of precipitation produced by cloud seeding \u2014 up to 10% \u2014 isn't enough at all to quench the drought-stricken West. \"It could help over the years augment the storage levels in reservoirs, so that when you get into that extract, you might just go into that drought with a little bit more than you would have otherwise,\" she said. \"That to me is the way that cloud seeding should be viewed. It's not going to be the silver bullet, but it could be a helpful tool in a water manager's toolbox.\" When it comes to tackling climate change as a whole, many also question the methods such as the deployment of fossil fuel-powered aircraft to inject silver iodide into clouds, arguing it is counterintuitive to the overall climate goals of slashing fossil fuel emissions. But Tessendorf argued it is a small price to pay in order to improve the technology. \"I will say that the number of aircraft and the duration of these flights to do cloud seeding and the programs that are currently having it done pales in comparison to the number of commercial flights and aircraft we have in the skies all over the world right now,\" she contended. \"So it's to me a drop in the bucket of extra fossil fuels being burned.\" \"But that does not mean that there isn't room for improvement there in order to have more of a clean process,\" Tessendorf added. With the climate crisis accelerating, climate scientists like Swain say resources are much better invested in climate solutions already guaranteed to make significant and equitable impacts. \"There needs to be controlled studies that actually shows it was the seeding that increased the precipitation in a meaningful way,\" Swain asserted. \"The best case scenario is it's a small incremental adjunct to other water-saving or conservation measures during scarce periods, but even that's not clear if it would really work in that capacity in any systematic way.\" CNN meteorologist Judson Jones contributed to this article"},

The friend introduced him to Kailee Lingo, her sorority sister at Tarleton State University in Stephenville, Texas. Kailee remembers that when she and Cade met, it was \"a connection at first sight.\" A month after college graduation, Kailee and Cade married in Marble Falls, Texas. They're both proud to be native Texans: Kailee's family has lived there for generations, and Cade's ancestors are among Texas' \"Old Three Hundred,\" the original families that joined Stephen F. Austin to settle the area in the 1800s. At the time, the DeSpains were both passionately anti-abortion. \"I was just your quintessential pro-life Texan,\" Kailee, 29, told CNN in a recent interview. \"I was raised in central Texas by extremely Republican parents and grandparents,\" Cade, 31, said. \"One hundred percent pro-life.\" Kailee and Cade have supported abortion rights since 2016, when she had a miscarriage at 16 weeks and was hospitalized for severe complications, including blood clots and infection. It was one of three miscarriages she had in the early years of marriage. \"It made me realize that pregnancy can be dangerous,\" she said. \"It made me think of my little sisters, and I wanted them to be able to have a choice if they ever had to go through something like that.\" Last September, when a restrictive anti-abortion law took effect in Texas, Kailee pleaded on Facebook for people to contact their elected representatives to protect abortion rights. In November, Kailee and Cade were overjoyed to learn that she was pregnant. Full of hope, they posted ultrasound pictures and a gender reveal video of a cannon shooting out blue confetti. They named their baby boy Finley. Then, about three months later, they learned that Finley had heart, lung, brain, kidney and genetic defects and would either be stillborn or die within minutes of birth. Carrying him to term put Kailee at high risk for severe pregnancy complications, including blood clots, preeclampsia and cancer. Even so, they could not get an abortion in Texas and fled to New Mexico. \"I've never felt more betrayed by a place I was once so proud to be from,\" Kailee said through tears. \"How could you be so cruel as to pass a law that you know will hurt women and that you know will cause babies to be born in pain?\" she added. \"How is that humane? How is that saving anybody?\" CNN emailed Texas lawmakers who authored or sponsored the state's anti-abortion laws. None of them responded to CNN's questions. When Kailee and Cade found out she was pregnant, they desperately hoped for a \"sticky baby\" -- a pregnancy that would stick -- after her three miscarriages. But after multiple ultrasounds, the doctors' prognosis was grim: His heart, lung, kidney and brain problems were severe, and his genetic disorder, called , meant he had an extra set of chromosomes. The doctors said that either Finley would die before birth, or if he did make it to term, he would die a few minutes or at most an hour after birth. One of their doctors told them, \"Some of these things could be fixed, but all of these things together -- this cannot be fixed,\" Kailee remembers. She says the doctor told them that before Texas' went into effect in September of last year, she would have advised abortion as \"the safest course for you [and] the most humane course of action for him.\" But the doctor said she could not offer them an abortion in Texas. She said the only option to get one was to travel out of state. Staying pregnant with Finley could have put Kailee's life in danger. She has two blood clotting disorders, which put her at a higher risk for having dangerous blood clots during pregnancy. Plus, mothers of babies with triploidy are more likely to get preeclampsia, a potentially deadly pregnancy disorder. Also, there was an increased risk for a associated with cancer. Kailee said she considered risking her own life to carry Finley to term. \"I [wanted] to say goodbye,\" she said. \"I [wanted] a chance to hold him.\" But then she thought about how Finley would suffer as he struggled to breathe. \"He's going to suffocate, he's going to die, and I'm going to watch him do it,\" she said. For Cade, there was only one option: It made no sense to him to risk his wife's life to have a baby who was certain to die quickly. Cade told Kailee, \" 'I will support you whatever decision that you make, but I really don't want to lose both of you, ' \" Kailee remembers. The couple opted for abortion, driving 10 hours to a clinic in New Mexico. The procedure and travel cost $3,500. They hoped their insurance would cover the procedure, but Texas , and the clinic told them their insurance company declined to pay. The DeSpains didn't have enough money -- Kailee said she was docked pay at work because she'd had too many sick days -- so Cade asked a relative he describes as \"the epitome of the Trump fanboy\" to give them the $3,500. The relative relented when Cade said that without the abortion, he could end up a widower at age 30. Cade said he didn't like asking for the money, but \"my job as a husband is to protect and love my wife. If I'm not fighting to keep her here, then I failed.\" Kailee had the abortion in March, when she was 19 weeks pregnant. While legislators did not respond to CNN's questions about Kailee's case, the president of Texas Right to Life did. John Seago said that \"Texas law is very clear about what circumstances that an abortion could be performed\" and that \"what happened to [Kailee] and the response of her physicians was absolutely a misrepresentation of the law. And this should never have happened.\" But Katie Keith, director of the Health Policy and the Law Initiative at Georgetown University Law Center, said -- the one that took effect last year and another one that went into effect last month -- are not at all clear and are \"designed to be purposely vague and broad.\" The more recent , for example, says an abortion can be performed if the mother \"has a life-threatening physical condition aggravated, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that places the female at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.\" \"They don't spell out exactly the situations when an abortion can be provided,\" Keith said. Kailee said her doctors told her they could give her an abortion only if she were at imminent risk of dying -- essentially, if she were \" 'dying on the table.' \" If a physician is found in violation of the law, the punishments can be severe: heavy fines, loss of their medical license and a possible life sentence in prison. Plus, citizens can file lawsuits against physicians they think have performed an illegal abortion, and if they win, they can get a $10,000 reward. If the citizen is wrong and the doctor wins the lawsuit, the doctor still has to pay their own legal fees, as Texas law specifically forbids doctors from recouping fees from plaintiffs. \"Facing the potential to become a felon and face life in prison for simply trying to take care of patients has been horrifying, and I'd be lying if I said that I haven't considered leaving the state,\" said Dr. Leah Tatum, a spokesperson for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists who practices in Austin, Texas, and has treated patients in similar situations to Kailee's since the Texas anti-abortion laws passed. The that went into effect last year barred most abortions at the onset of fetal cardiac activity, which can occur as early as six weeks into pregnancy and before many people know they are pregnant. It was one of the earliest and most restrictive abortion laws. that ban abortion or severely restrict the procedure have gone into effect in about a dozen states after the US Supreme Court ended a constitutional right to abortion on June 24. Kailee says that the last time she saw her obstetrician, she advised her not to get pregnant in Texas. \"She said 'this is not safe,' \" Kailee remembers. \" She said, 'I need you to look at me. I need you to understand that if you get pregnant in Texas and that if you have complications, that I cannot intervene until I can prove that you're going to die.' \" The DeSpains say they are thinking about leaving Texas, but it would be difficult to leave their work and their families. Kailee said they're sharing their story in hopes of increasing awareness so \"that stories like mine can change enough voters' perspectives.\" \"I'm still so angry and hurt about it that I can hardly see straight,\" she wrote on the day after the abortion. \"Finley and I were simply collateral damage in a much bigger picture. It's hard for me to wrap my head around the thought process of lawmakers that would rather a full-term baby suffocate to death than allow a mother to make a decision that spares her child that pain.\" CNN's Nadia Kounang and John Bonifield contributed to this report."},

Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain. The \"Ironhand\" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they don't have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks. Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%. The Swedish company describes the system as a \"soft exoskeleton.\" Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance. Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove. \"When you have the glove on, it provides strength and reduces the effort needed when lifting objects,\" says Mikael Wester, Bioservo's marketing director. \"It's all in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run.\" The system consists of a backpack, which houses the power pack, and artificial tendons that connect to the glove. There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip. Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses. Each Ironhand system costs around \u20ac6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the , costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product. The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. \"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team. \"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\" Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations. The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from . \"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\" This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system."},

{"url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/14/world/tusimple-autonomous-truck-spc-intl/index.html", "title": "There's a shortage of truckers, but TuSimple thinks it has a solution: no driver needed", "paragraphs": " Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the and , exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple. Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024. TuSimple's latest road test involved hauling fresh produce 951 miles, from Nogales, Arizona to Oklahoma City. The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. \"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still , TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software.  \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. According to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads.  The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. That doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu. Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.  TuSimple has prominent competitors, such as Google spinoff Waymo and Uber-backed Aurora, but those are working on a wider range of self-driving vehicles, including passenger cars. TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark.  Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said.  Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.\""},

The sister of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was speaking at the Global Supertrends Conference 2022 on Wednesday. The Web3 is a hypothetical, future version of the internet based on blockchain technology \u2014 an \"ideal utopia,\" said Zuckerberg. \"But \u2026 that's not what's happening. What's happening in reality, is chaos.\" The founder and CEO of Zuckerberg Media, a production company and marketing consultancy, added, \"You're the only one watching your own back and your own assets, people are spending time protecting themselves by setting up so many different wallets and protecting their identity and that's not contributing to development in the area.\" Zuckerberg, who was an early employee at Meta \u2014 formerly known as Facebook \u2014 explained that various metaverses are now acting as \"their own walled garden,\" in which users are unable to use their assets across platforms. The metaverse can be loosely defined as a virtual world where people live, work and play. With cryptocurrency, users can buy and develop virtual land or dress their own avatars. \"Right now, I'm on Decentraland, my son is on Roblox, my other son is on Fortnite. That's great \u2014 we're all in the metaverse. [But] we have no interaction with one another,\" she said. \"In order to really unlock the potential [of Web3], we're going to need to figure out a system where there's interoperability. What you have goes with you wherever you are, [and] we're not there yet,\" Zuckerberg added. However, according to Zuckerberg, that's easier said than done because no company running a metaverse right now wants to give up control or \"share that ownership.\" \"That's why it's not we're not seeing that kind of consumer mainstream adoption yet because there needs to be a world where you leave the house with one wallet. And you need to see that same behavior online also.\" She added that Web3 needs experts who have been involved in the global banking system and Web2 \u2014 the internet that we know today \u2014 to lend a \"protective layer.\" The need for such experts is all the more important because it has been \"too easy\" for users to be scammed or lose all their assets in Web3, said Zuckerberg. \"There needs to be more protections for consumers \u2026 I think we will wind up [with] web 2.7, where there is some centralization, keeping people safe, but the ability to port your assets with you to any site.\" Another thing that needs to be improved in Web3 is user-friendliness, she added. \"It should not take 45 steps to set up a cryptocurrency wallet, buy a currency and enter the metaverse. It needs to [be] one-stop, beginner-friendly.\" The metaverse may still be in its infancy, but Zuckerberg pointed out that sectors like real estate will be \"extremely valuable.\" \"Wherever there's scarcity \u2026 there's value. I think the big question will just be, is there scarcity in the metaverse and if there is, there will be value in real estate there,\" she added. According to data from MetaMetrics Solutions, real estate sales in the metaverse surpassed $500 million in 2021 and could double in 2022. Zuckerberg said that education and training will be another \"huge area\" for opportunities and revenue. \"Especially in this new age where workers are remote, it is very difficult to upskill remote workers \u2026 I think training in the metaverse, education in an interactive way, is going to become crucial for every business that has a remote work,\" she added. \"We're really just scratching the surface of what we're going to see.\""},

He was speaking at the 2022 Global Supertrends Conference. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced in May that the country will take firm steps to restart idled nuclear power plants to stabilize energy supply and prices. In 2011, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami, which killed nearly 16,000 people and caused the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986. Though there have been reservations among the Japanese public over the use of nuclear energy, particularly when it comes to the issue of safety, Tanaka said the future of nuclear power is now safer, and stressed the importance of minimizing risk and maintaining \"peaceful use.\" Tanaka attributed the increase in public support to the possibility of \"serious problems by the end of this year\" if Japan does not have nuclear power. He added that Russia supplies 9% of Japan's natural gas, and losing that supply could spell trouble for the country as it would have to turn to alternative sources, which would lead to a spike in energy prices. Japan has repeatedly criticized Russian aggression in Ukraine and has slapped Moscow with economic sanctions. In response, Russia sanctioned over 300 Japanese lawmakers in July. Russia recently cut gas supplies to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to just a fifth of its capacity. Moscow has repeatedly denied it is weaponizing fossil fuel supplies over the Russia-Ukraine war. Tanaka said that Japan wants to secure energy supplies but also work toward reaching carbon neutrality by 2050, and striking that balance could prove increasingly challenging. Nuclear power has been touted as an important option for decarbonization.\n\"Japan is trying to secure the supply of energy, especially electricity, while trying to maintain the targets of carbon neutral by 2050 intact. So this is really (a) challenge for Japan to do many things,\" he said."},

In a recent note, Charles Dumas, chief economist at U.K.-based investment research firm TS Lombard, said that action on climate change is often criticized as moving too slowly. However, with governments increasing spending to aid their post-Covid economies, they may start catching up. A key tenet of this is the ever-decreasing cost of electricity per megawatt hour, according to figures from TS Lombard, with costs of solar, offshore and onshore wind dropping over the last 10 years, while gas and coal have remained largely the same. \"Effectively by 2030 the cost of renewable electricity is going to be half that of coal and gas sourced electricity,\" Dumas told CNBC. These trends will bring many of the various pledges to reach net zero more closely in sight. The fatal floods in Germany in recent weeks have put the impacts of climate change firmly in the spotlight again but they are only the latest in a series of devastating extreme weather events of late, including the sprawling wildfires in Oregon. Amid this backdrop, the United Nations Climate Change Conference, better known as COP26, will meet in Glasgow in November. It will mark one of the most significant multilateral meetings on climate since the Paris agreement. Dumas said that as COP26 approaches, governments need to understand their key priorities, and among them should be infrastructure investments as numerous technological and engineering challenges continue to obstruct renewable energy. \"I think the intermittency problem is pretty serious and it's not just that the sun goes down at night,\" Dumas said. In the case of solar power, output can be mixed depending on the location of infrastructure like solar farms. \"There's huge variation with sunny days in winter and sunny days in the middle of summer so the intermittency takes on a very big seasonal aspect,\" Dumas said. \"You can have vicious weather for a long time in the middle of December or January and lo and behold you wouldn't want to be depending on solar power.\" Energy transmission could be another bottleneck, he said. While the developing world, including several African nations, has great potential in developing sites for generating solar power, that power needs to move easily. \"The issue of transmission technology is really major. If you want Chad to be the new Saudi Arabia, because of the Sahara Desert there's a lot of sun there, but you want the electricity to be used in Europe then you're talking about some expensive processes and processes needing a lot of research and a lot of further investment.\" Storage and carbon capture are all areas that require hefty investment, Dumas added, if governments are to reach their net-zero targets. \"What we need is a very clear public policy lead in order to get anywhere near these net zero promises and I suspect that actually what it's going to be about is a carbon tax, which the Americans may resist but will be necessary,\" he said. Paul Steele, chief economist at an independent policy research institute called the International Institute for Environment and Development, said that climate action and renewable energy investments will serve the dual purpose of tackling the climate crisis while creating jobs for the post-Covid economy. \"One of the priorities coming out of Covid is to create labor intensive employment. Both in developed and developing countries, you can provide labor intensive employment through renewable energy,\" Steele said. One example, he said, was the retrofitting of boilers in homes in the U.K., which would help push the country toward its climate targets and create new jobs while being relatively inexpensive in the grand scheme of things. Steele said that investments to drive a climate-friendly economy cannot be short term or have quick goals. He pointed to the various government support schemes for the airline industry, which has been battered by the pandemic. Just this week, the European courts gave the nod to a $2.9 billion bailout for Air France-KLM's Dutch business. Bailout funds like these should be tied to sustainability commitments by the airline industry, he said, but that can be a dicey proposition to get over the line. \"Governments aren't making the connections enough and traditionally treasuries and particularly the ministries of transport are still dominated by road building lobbies and people who like to build highways and increase transport rather than people who want to invest in sustainable alternatives.\"  "},

Those investments come just as Emirates posted a $1.1 billion loss for the year ended March 31. \"While others respond to industry pressures with cost cuts, Emirates is flying against the grain and investing to deliver ever better experiences to our customers,\" said the president of Emirates airline, Tim Clark. Emirates is not the only airline pulling out all the stops to ride the tailwinds of \"revenge travel\" \u2014 the idea that people are making up for time \"lost\" during the pandemic to travel again. Earlier this year, Finnair launched a new line of premium economy cabins, featuring seats that provide around 50% more space than their economy seats.

The upgrades come on the heels of an industry report predicting that business travel spending will return to pre-pandemic levels in 2026 rather than 2024, as previously forecast. Though spending by business travelers has been on the upswing, the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) annual report stated that the 2021 figure was still less than half of the over $1.4 trillion that was generated by in business travel in 2019. One travel analytics company, however, noted a shift in demand toward premium seats. \"During the pandemic, we saw that the numbers of people travelling by air collapsed. However, the proportion of travelers flying in premium cabins increased significantly,\" Olivier Ponti of ForwardKeys told CNBC in an email.\nPonti said that before the pandemic, the split between premium and economy seats was a ratio of 13:87, compared with 17:83 in 2022.\n\"While there's no guarantee that the shift towards premium seats will be maintained as air travel recovers, one can understand why the airlines would want to invest in keeping hold of premium passengers, who, this year have typically spent 575% more on a seat than those flying economy.\" Others are skeptical, however. Edward Russell, an editor at Skift, a travel industry news site, told CNBC it's unclear how much of an effect \"small\" product changes will have on sales. \"Most travelers either fly the airline, or alliance, where they have loyalty, or opt for the cheapest fare.

Job: Emmy-award winning TV host of \" Samantha Brown's Places to Love\"\nStarted in: Comedy \" I went to Syracuse University for musical theater because I so desperately wanted to move to New York City and become a thespian. I wanted to do Shakespeare and be on Broadway. That didn't pan out. I waited on tables for a good eight years. But I loved improv, and I was a part of an improv comedy troupe. So I just kept auditioning for jobs. A writer recommended me to a production company that was \u2026 looking for a host. But my audition for it had to be totally improvised. That's how I got the job. When you are a travel host, there's no script. Yet it is still up to you to define the scene, to understand the trajectory of a story and how to end it. Also in improv, the golden rule is to never say no, it's always yes \u2014 to keep things going. Waiting on tables in New York City for eight years, you start to be really humbled, [but] those were the tools that I had that got me a job that I never in my wildest dreams thought I would ever have.\" Job: Creator of \" Strictly Dumpling\" and other YouTube channels (total: about 8 million subscribers)\nStarted in: Accounting and wedding videography \"I moved to the U.S. from China when I was 8 years old. My parents started working in restaurants, and eventually started their own very Americanized Chinese restaurant. So I grew up on a steady diet of General Tso's chicken and crab rangoon. There wasn't a lot of diversity where I'm from, but it helped that my parents sent me back to China when I was 13. Most people get grounded and sent to their room as a punishment \u2014 I got sent to China for two years. That's when I was like: Wow, it's so amazing \u2014 the people, the history \u2014 I want to know more. After college, I went to New York and worked on Wall Street for a year. Then I became a wedding videographer because I wanted to be flexible. I was living in a small basement apartment in Brooklyn with no air conditioning, making about $400 \u2014 on a good week. But this was the first time I was eating something that wasn't Red Lobster and Olive Garden. I got a taste of diverse ethnic food in Chinatown, and I started to discover a lot of my heritage that I never really saw as important before. I started recording food videos on YouTube as a food diary for myself. I remember having a conversation with a friend that food content will never amount to anything. There wasn't anybody online doing it. I had like 10 subscribers. Somehow it grew to this, which was never expected. I never really had much money growing up \u2014 or throughout most of my adulthood. So I was always looking for things that were inexpensive but also really filling and delicious. And that's pretty much what I do around the world now.\" Job: Television host of \" Family Travel with Colleen Kelly\"\nStarted in: Sales \"I tried out for the broadcast school at the University of Texas. The school gave you one chance to be accepted into the program. I had never sat at an anchor desk with a camera pointed at me. I failed miserably. Several years later, I graduated and got my first job in sales, eventually moving to Chicago and working in the pharmaceutical industry. The money was amazing, and I had a company car. But I wasn't living my dream, and this started to really bother me. In my early 30s, I got married and eventually quit my job to be a stay-at-home mom. One day, when my two little girls were in school, I went to our town hall's cable TV station and asked if, in exchange for teaching me how to edit, I could host the local entertainment show about our village \u2014 something like \"Access Hollywood\" for our 50,000-resident town. Because they had no other offers, they said yes. I acted confident, but I was as green as they come. I was shaking in my boots every time I did an interview and read voice-over, but I was gaining experience and knowledge. I confided in another mom that my dream was to host a national travel show, and, surprisingly, she agreed to produce it with me. We wrote a script, found a local camera guy for a few dollars and made a pilot. I took meetings with two major companies \u2014 both said no. I was told by one network that women don't watch travel shows, so the concept of family travel didn't appeal to them. I then sent thousands of emails to television stations. Nothing worked. Finally, my mother suggested I call the local PBS station. I googled the head of programming, called him (no emails) and got a meeting. After more meetings, we learned PBS was picking two shows to go national, and \"Family Travel with Colleen Kelly\" was one of them. We scraped by for a year, producing 13 episodes that first season. Now, the show has been on for more than 10 years. And, the best part is that I can bring my family with me.

While the day of the week travelers book may not matter much, the day they fly does, according to Google Flights' research, which examined five years of historical flight data from Aug. 1, 2017 to Aug. 1, 2022. \"On average, flights that depart on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday have been 12% cheaper than weekend departures,\" wrote Byers. \"If you exclude international destinations, the potential savings jump even higher to 20%.\" Another common strategy \u2014 booking early \u2014 also works, according to the data. For U.S. domestic flights, airfares have been lowest between three and eight weeks before a departure date, with prices \"bottoming out\" 44 days out, according to the research. Non-stop flights cost on average about 20% more than connecting flights, according to Google Flights, but flights with stops also increase the risk of interruptions. An Instagram poll by the travel insurance company World Nomads indicated more than 1 in 3 respondents spent up to $250 on flights, meals or hotels because of flight delays or cancellations this summer, while 12% reported spending between $500 to $1,000. Travelers with flexible flying days can use Google Flights' \"date grid\" function to quickly ascertain the cheapest dates to depart and arrive in a given week. Those who want to travel for a specific duration \u2014 say, two weeks \u2014 but are flexible on when, can use the \"price graph\" function to see the cheapest times to fly too. Price tracking also eliminates the need to search again and again to price-check a desired route. Search the route once, hit the button to \"track prices\" and Google Flights will send notifications of airfare changes via email. Based on its historical data, Google Flights also suggests the \"best times\" to book flights for peak-period travel and popular routes. Travelers hoping to save money on airfare to Europe are advised to plan the earliest, while summer vacationers can consider making plans weeks, rather than months, in advance."},

A new study compared prices to find out", "paragraphs": " Many travelers try to save money by searching the internet for cheaper hotel rates. But a new study suggests it may not be worth the time \u2014 at least in some places. The travel insurance comparison site InsureMyTrip compared rates for 950 hotels in 19 global cities on three popular booking websites as well as each hotel's site. According to the results published last week, Hotels.com had the best overall rates \u2014 but just barely. Hotels.com had the best rates in 620 instances, which was slightly higher than Expedia, which had the cheapest rates in 579 instances. Booking directly with a hotel was more expensive, but by only about $6 more on average, according to the study. \"There have been conflicting views on hotel rates, and people ... believe that booking through online travel platforms ensured a better rate than the hotel website,\" said Shalabh Arora, director of marketing at India's Four Seasons Hotel Bengaluru. \"However, it's not so at Four Seasons where rate parity is taken very seriously.\" He said the hotels' website has a pop-up function which compares rates offered by the hotel with those on other booking platforms. Finally, the website Booking.com had the cheapest rates in 72 instances \u2014 or about 7% of the time \u2014 according to the study. \"Not only was [Booking.com] rarely the most affordable, but it was also the most expensive option the majority of the time,\" according to the published results. The company's Managing Director for Asia Pacific Laura Houldsworth responded to the study by email, stating that the company aims \"to always be transparent with our customers\" and that \"our property partners are free to set their own prices on Booking.com.\" She added that \"our promise to price match also means that if a customer should ever find a lower price on another website, Booking.com will refund the difference.\" The report found average hotel rates on Hotels.com and Expedia were the same in seven of 19 cities, with overall averages varying by just 27 cents. \"Expedia and Hotels.com often had the same price, especially with the international hotels,\" said Sarah Webber, director of marketing for InsureMyTrip. Both brands are owned by Expedia Group, which also operates other travel booking websites, including Travelocity, Hotwire, Orbitz and CheapTickets. \"Hotels working with Expedia Group distribute their rates across all of our brands,\" said Anna Brown, a company public relations manager. \"The rate is similar across brands, however various offers ... approved by our hotel partners, sometimes create rate differences.\" Brown said rates can also vary through brands' app-only pricing, while Hotwire's \"Hot Rates\" mask hotels' names prior to purchase in exchange for deep discounts on last-minute bookings. Booking.com is part of Booking Holdings, which operates Priceline, Agoda and Kayak. Booking Holdings had the highest revenue among all online travel agencies from 2019 to 2021, according to the research company Statista. The InsureMyTrip report showed significant rate differences in certain cities. For instance, travelers could save as much as $88 per night in Honolulu, if they found the lowest price. In New York, the report found average hotel rates varied from $293 on Hotels.com to $367 on Booking.com. The study also found: But rate fluctuations were less pronounced outside of the United States. Posted rates varied less than $10 per night on average in Hong Kong, Bangkok, Macau, Kuala Lumpur and Istanbul, according to the research. InsureMyTrip's study represents a snapshot in time, with the research analyzing rates for a double room for two people booked for the night of Aug. 27, 2022, the firm said. All searches were conducted on the same day to avoid price fluctuations, since \"prices can change quickly and without warning,\" said Webber. However, the study did not consider whether rates were refundable or included taxes, said Webber. \"To keep the study as simple as possible, we took the price seen on the sites as the final cost,\" she said. \"So, it's definitely something to consider as not all hotels or booking sites include the same extras in the final price.\" Other factors, such as prepayment requirements and breakfast inclusions, can affect rates too, which further complicates the hotel price comparison process \u2014 for researchers and travelers alike."},

But they still have options", "paragraphs": " There was a time when Western Europe was the destination of choice for Russian tourists. But things have changed. Max, a Russian in his 40s, used to stroll museums in France, enjoy fine cuisine in Italy, and go on hikes on the hills of Spain. Then Russia invaded Ukraine. This year, Max, who told CNBC that he's not comfortable sharing his last name, \"did not even consider\" Europe as a vacation destination. \"I am aware of the problems with obtaining visas to European countries,\" he said. Last week, the European Union agreed to suspend a 2007 travel agreement with Moscow which facilitated the issuance of visas to Russians. The move will make it more difficult and expensive for Russians to travel to the bloc. The closure of EU airspace to Russian airlines in February also made traveling difficult. \" The bad irony is that I am absolutely against the war and Putin, but I also experience travel difficulties,\" Max said. \"In the future, when Putin leaves and we become a normal country again, I hope that I will be able to visit Europe again. I love Italy very much.\" Max is one of many Russians who traded European holiday destinations for other countries this summer. EU countries like Italy, Spain, Cyprus and Greece were among the top 20 destinations most booked by Russian travelers before the war's outbreak, according to data from ForwardKeys, a travel data company. However, Olivier Ponti of ForwardKeys said Russian air travel to Europe over the summer was just 26% of what it was in 2019. \"Russia's invasion of Ukraine has certainly restricted the holiday choices of its citizens, as direct flights to many popular destinations have been banned,\" he said. \"It is still possible for Russians to visit Europe, but they now need to change planes in places like Istanbul or Dubai.\" According to ForwardKeys, which examined flight arrival data, several leisure destinations saw an increase in the market share of Russian visitors in June, July and August compared to 2019. Most of those countries were popular with Russian visitors before the war too. According to the Economic Intelligence Unit (EIU), Turkey was the top destination for Russian tourists in 2019, followed by the Russia-occupied territory of Abkhazia, the UAE and Maldives. Analysts from the EIU told CNBC that the Maldives has long been a preferred destination for wealthy Russians who can easily obtain tourist visas on arrival to stay up to 90 days. A more favorable exchange rate in Turkey since mid-March likely boosted travel numbers there, EIU analysts Mario Bikarski and Federica Reccia told CNBC. The Turkish lira currently stands at 18.23 against the dollar\u2014 near record lows after Turkey's central bank slashed its benchmark rates in August despite inflation being near 80%. Still, Russians' ability to travel may be further curtailed, they said. In addition to the EU's suspension of its 2007 preferential visa agreement with Moscow, Bikarski and Reccia said, economic problems could discourage Russians from traveling. \"As the war grinds on, we also expect the deteriorating economic outlook to weigh on Russians' propensity to travel.\""},

The local government approvals allow Baidu's Apollo Go robotaxi business to eliminate the cost of human personnel in some instances. The initial scale of the permits is small: 10 robotaxis divided between two suburban areas of Wuhan and Chongqing, two major Chinese cities. In April, Baidu and rival robotaxi operator Pony.ai received approval from a Beijing suburban district to operate robotaxis without a human driver. But the Chinese capital still requires human staff to sit in the robotaxi with passengers. Municipal authorities across China have issued an increasing number of permits in the last year that allow robotaxi companies to operate and charge fares in selected areas. In the U.S., Alphabet's Waymo and General Motors ' subsidiary Cruise can already run public robotaxis with no human staff in the vehicles. Laws for testing robotaxis and charging riders vary by city and state. Baidu claimed it has received more than one million orders for robotaxi rides.

Here's where the jobs are", "paragraphs": " Recession fears may be looming in Asia-Pacific, but that hasn't stopped companies in India, Australia and Singapore from continuing their hiring spree, according to LinkedIn. As economies reopened after the pandemic, companies in the hospitality, retail and entertainment sectors ramped up hiring, said Feon Ang, Asia-Pacific managing director at the professional networking platform. All three countries saw an increase in job postings on LinkedIn for jobs in the accommodation sector, such as hotels, motels, casino hotels and bed-and-breakfast inns. According to data collected by LinkedIn, paid job postings for careers in Australia, India and Singapore increased in June compared to a year ago, with the following sectors seeing the most growth: 1. Accommodation, up 62%\n2. Retail jobs, up 46%\n3. Financial services, up 25% 1. Accommodation, up 65%\n2. Construction, up 40%\n3. Real estate and equipment rental services, up 25% 1. Accommodation, up 15%\n2. Transport and logistics, up 31%\n3. Entertainment providers (businesses involved in performances, events, and exhibitions), up 100% However, jobs in Singapore's health care, education and construction industries were all down by more than 30%, according to LinkedIn. Ang noted that the cutback of job postings for Singapore's construction sector was likely due to measures introduced by the government to cool the private and residential property market. Although there's an increase in hiring rates across the three countries, there was less competition among job seekers in June compared to one year ago, LinkedIn data showed. On average, there was a more than a 50% drop in applications for paid job postings on LinkedIn in Australia, India and Singapore \"Even as job postings rise, workers are being more selective in picking their next role, and so competition for jobs on average is down,\" said Ang. \"This means that workers are in a position to demand more out of work, and have higher expectations of what they want in a job \u2013 and that's a healthy sign,\" she added. In both Australia and Singapore, paid job postings that offered remote work options fell. Paid listings in Australia fell by 8% in June compared to a year ago, although sentiment for flexible working arrangements was still strong. Opportunities that offered remote working options received two times more applications on average, according to LinkedIn. In Singapore, paid job postings that allowed employees to work from home fell from 8% in the first quarter to 6.7% in the second quarter. But unlike employees in Australia, LinkedIn observed that interest in flexible working arrangements seemed to be waning in Singapore. Employers in India felt differently, according to the data. Paid job postings in the South Asian country which offered remote work options remained relatively constant throughout the year and there wasn't particularly more interest in jobs with remote options. \"Postings with remote options received only 1.1x more applications on average relative to their absolute share of all job postings in both quarters,\" said LinkedIn."},

Lindsey Graham says he was stating the obvious with Trump riots claim", "paragraphs": " U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham on Saturday defended suggesting there would be \"riots in the streets\" if former President Donald Trump was prosecuted for mishandling classified information, saying he condemned the violence seen during the Capitol riot last year. \"What I tried to do was state the obvious,\" Graham, a South Carolina Republican and close ally of Trump, told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick at the Ambrosetti Forum in Italy. \"Here's what I said, The raid on [former] President Trump's home, the likely nominee for 2024, better bear some fruit here,\" he added. \"If it's just about mishandling classified information, we've had a standard set when it came to Hillary Clinton.\" \"Our country, the people on our side, believe that when it comes to the justice system, there are no rules regarding Trump, [it's a case of] 'get him, it doesn't matter how you get him,' so I said that if it's similar to what happened to Clinton and he gets prosecuted, it'll be one of the most disruptive events in America,\" Graham said. Trump and his allies have argued that the FBI, which is investigating Trump for potential violations of laws related to espionage and obstruction of justice, is treating him differently than it treated Hillary Clinton, who was the subject of an FBI investigation into her use of a private email server while secretary of state, but wasn't prosecuted. Trump's critics argue that the two cases aren't comparable. Graham said he rejected the violence seen on the Jan.6 Capitol riot and said \"all those people who defiled the Capitol should go to jail\" but said that any perceived unfairness toward Trump would have consequences. \"I don't want to pardon the January 6th people because that seems to reinforce the narrative that this is OK. I said something I really believe \u2014 if he does what she did with classified information and he gets prosecuted and she didn't it would create a problem.\" Graham said last week that there would be \"riots in the streets\" if Trump was prosecuted for mishandling classified information. \"I'll say this, if there's a prosecution of Donald Trump for mishandling classified information, after the Clinton debacle \u2026 there'll be riots in the streets,\" Graham told Fox News' Trey Gowdy, a former Republican congressman. Trump is currently under investigation and risks being indicted over his treatment of classified White House records that he took to his residence in Mar-a-Lago, Florida. Last week, the release of a heavily redacted affidavit showed how concerns about illegal activity and obstruction of justice led to an FBI search at Trump's resort in July. Graham conceded that he believed in \"handling classified information responsibly\" but again insisted that \"mishandling classified information is really bad but we can't have a system where one person gets prosecuted and the other doesn't.\" Asked whether Trump is the best person to represent the Republican Party in 2024, Graham said \"I think he could be.\" \"Whether you like Trump or not he was a consequential president ... I think a strong American president, unpredictable, is a good thing as long as you keep it within the boundaries. His problem is personal, his policies have stood the test of time but has he worn the American people out in terms of his personality? Time will tell. But I'll say this, after the Biden presidency, if there's a policy debate in 2024, I like his chances. If it's a personality contest, he'll be in trouble.\" Graham said he talks to Trump \"all the time\" and that the former president still thinks that he was \"cheated.\" Graham said he voted to certify the 2020 election and that Biden is the legitimate president. Trump \"genuinely believes that the system was rigged against him and I said 'Mr. President, I'm not trying to tell you to change your beliefs. I'm trying to tell you that you have no chance of winning in 2020 but you have a pretty good chance of winning in 2024 if you want to,'\" Graham said, noting that he told Trump that if he does make a comeback \"it will be one of the greatest political comebacks in American history.\" A federal judge on Thursday denied Graham's latest effort to challenge a subpoena for his testimony before a special grand jury in Georgia, which is investigating possible criminal election interference by Trump and his allies in 2020. However, the judge limited the scope of the subpoena by ordering that Graham could not be questioned about phone calls he made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and his staff in the weeks after the November 2020 election between Trump and President Joe Biden. It follows continued bids by Graham to avoid testifying on the grounds that his position as a lawmaker grants him immunity under the U.S. Constitution's \"speech or debate\" clause. Graham reiterated his position on Saturday, saying \"I didn't start this debate. You have a country prosecutor who has decided to investigate a national election and to call anybody and everybody connected with the role they played in the election. I'm a United States Senator, in our Constitution, we have a speech or debate immunity clause so that we can't be hauled into courts all over the country every time we do something somebody doesn't like.\" \"I think the court is going to recognize that my activities as a United States Senator was covered by the speech and debate clause that that the county prosecutor's desire to bring me down to Georgia oversteps the constitution.\""},

Here's what Trump might say, said Graham. \"Alright, you've lived through four years of this. You get a chance to start over,\" he said. \"Remember me? I may not be your cup of tea, but when I was president, our border was secure, we had the lowest illegal crossings in 40 years. I did it,\" he continued. \"When I was president, I stood up to China and they listened. When I was president, we had the strongest military since Ronald Reagan. When I was president, I destroyed the caliphate. When I was president, we had conservative judges, not liberal judges. He has a story to tell,\" said Graham. Ultimately, however, Graham acknowledged that it may take more than policy pledges for Trump to regain favor among American voters. \"His problem is personal,\" he said. \"His policies have stood the test of time.

The senator has been critical of the FBI's investigation, accusing the intelligence service of double standards in their treatment of Trump versus Hillary Clinton, who was the subject of a separate investigation into her use of a private email server while secretary of state.

Last week, Mississippi's Department of Revenue confirmed with CNBC that student loan forgiveness will be taxable, and the North Carolina Department of Revenue shared the same in a news release. Of course, with state legislation in flux, it's still possible these tax policies, among others, may change. In addition to Indiana, Mississippi and North Carolina, state-level taxation also may be possible in Arkansas, California, Minnesota and Wisconsin, according to a preliminary analysis from the Tax Foundation.

Taxing forgiveness isn't likely in Massachusetts, but the state hasn't shared an official determination. Currently, here's a breakdown of the status in pending states. The Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration on Friday told CNBC that student loan forgiveness may be taxable.

Indiana's Department of Revenue has confirmed with CNBC that student loan forgiveness is taxable at the state, and possibly county level. While the Massachusetts Department of Revenue hasn't made a final determination, state Rep. Steve Owens, a Democrat, said in a tweet that student loan forgiveness won't be taxable. What's more, the state has already issued guidance on conforming to the American Rescue Plan's exclusion, Owens said in a separate tweet. The Mississippi Department of Revenue has confirmed with CNBC that student loan forgiveness will be taxable at the state level. Student loan forgiveness is \"currently considered taxable income,\" according to a news release from the North Carolina Department of Revenue. However, the department is monitoring legislation changes from the state's General Assembly. With the state tax law conforming before the American Rescue Plan Act, it's possible Wisconsin may tax student loan forgiveness, according to the Tax Foundation. Tax-free forgiveness will require a statutory change and action from the state legislature, a spokesperson the Wisconsin Department of Revenue told CNBC. \"We will certainly address this discrepancy with federal law in our upcoming biennial budget request in an effort to ensure Wisconsin taxpayers don't face penalties and increased taxes for having their loans forgiven,\" they said."},

Judge Aileen Cannon at the same time temporarily blocked the Department of Justice from reviewing or using the seized material for investigative purposes, until the special master's examination of the documents is completed, or until a further court order. That independent third party will examine \"the seized property for personal items and documents and potentially privileged material subject to claims of attorney-client and/or executive privilege,\" Cannon wrote in her order in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Cannon said her order would not impede an ongoing review of classified documents found at Trump's residence and the assessment of any possible damage on U.S. intelligence by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The DOJ is conducting a criminal probe of the removal of government records from the White House to Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach when he left office in January 2021. By law, such records should have been given to the National Archives and Records Administration at the end of Trump's term. The judge, who was appointed by Trump, in her ruling nodded at the fact that the Aug. 8 raid at Mar-a-Lago was the first time that law enforcement authorities had ever searched the residence of a former president as part of a criminal probe of that person. As Trump's lawyers argued at a court hearing last week, Cannon wrote, \"the investigation and treatment of a former president is of unique interest to the general public, and the country is served best by an orderly\nprocess that promotes the interest and perception of fairness.\" Cannon ordered the DOJ and Trump's lawyers to confer and jointly submit a list of proposed special master candidates by Friday. She also told them to outline what they believe should be the special master's duties and limitations, as well as the watchdog's compensation. Trump had asked for a special master to be appointed weeks after the raid, during which FBI agents found more than 10,000 government documents, more than 100 of which were classified or highly classified. FBI agents also found four dozen empty document folders marked \"classified\" during the raid, 43 or which were found in Trump's office. The remaining five empty folders with that marking were found in containers in a storage room. The FBI also found another 42 empty folders marked \"Return to Staff Secretary/Miliary [sic] Aide,\" during the raid. The DOJ had opposed the appointment of that watchdog, arguing that Trump had no right to possess the records, and that a special master review would delay its ongoing criminal investigation. But Cannon in her order said she did not believe that the review by the special master \"under the present circumstances would cause undue delay.\" The DOJ and a spokeswoman for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Cannon's order."},

It also said federal agencies should consider information from crypto miners and local utilities \"in a privacy-preserving manner\" to help understand and mitigate the problem. Crypto operations in the U.S. now consume as much energy as all home computers or all residential lighting, the White House said in a report. The findings come amid mounting criticism over the amount of electricity that crypto mining operations produce. The process of cryptocurrency mining involves running banks of computers to solve complicated math equations in order to create new coins and validate transactions. Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, is wedded to this \"proof of work\" system, although the second-most poplar currency, ether, is moving to a different method that may not require as much energy. U.S. crypto production represents between 0.2% and 0.3% of global greenhouse gas emissions and between 0.4% and 0.8% of domestic emissions, respectively, though the estimates are uncertain, the report said. Mining crypto produces planet-warming emissions primarily by burning coal, natural gas and other fossil fuels to generate electricity. This year, crypto mining produced between 110 and 170 million metric tons on carbon pollution across the world and roughly 25 to 50 million metric tons in the U.S. alone, the report said. The process produces electricity by purchasing it from the power grid or by producing and disposing of computers and mining infrastructure. \"Electricity usage from digital assets is contributing to GHG emissions, additional pollution, noise, and other local impacts, depending on markets, policies, and local electricity sources,\" the White House said in the report. \"Depending on the energy intensity of the technology used, crypto-assets could hinder broader efforts to achieve net-zero carbon pollution consistent with U.S. climate commitments and goals,\" it added. The report is a result of President Joe Biden 's executive order in March that called on the government to examine the risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies. The president has pledged to reduce U.S. emissions from 2005 levels at least in half by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The report said that global crypto mining emissions are greater than the emissions of many individual countries and equivalent to the global emissions from all barges, tankers and other ships on inland waterways. Additionally, Bitcoin, the world's largest digital currency by market value, generates approximately two-thirds of global crypto greenhouse gas emissions."},

Having ascended to the throne in 1952 at age 25, Elizabeth became the U.K.'s longest reigning monarch in September 2015 when she surpassed Queen Victoria's record of nearly 64 years. Elizabeth became the world's longest-reigning monarch and head of state when Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej died in October 2016 after he spent 70 years on the throne. During her life, the queen was a patron to hundreds of charities and organizations and was one of the most traveled world leaders. CNBC looks back at some of the British monarch's most memorable moments. Elizabeth was born April 21, 1926, the first child of the then-Duke and Duchess of York. In 1930, Elizabeth's parents gave birth to her sister, Princess Margaret Rose. \"Lilibet\" ascended to the throne sooner than anyone had expected. Her uncle, childless King Edward VIII abdicated in December 1936 over his romance with divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson. Elizabeth's father became King George VI, putting her next in the succession. During World War II, Elizabeth joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service at age 18 in 1945, with the rank of subaltern. By the time the war ended, she had become a junior commander. Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip, her third cousin and a member of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gluecksburg, met in 1934 at the wedding of Philip's cousin, Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark. However, it wasn't until July 1947 until the pair were officially engaged. They married on Nov. 20, 1947, at Westminster Abbey. A year later, Nov. 14, 1948, Elizabeth gave birth to the first of her four children, Prince Charles. Before ascending to the throne, Elizabeth had two children, Charles and Princess Anne (1950), who were then followed by Prince Andrew in 1960 and Prince Edward in 1964. King George VI died on Feb. 6, 1952, making the 25-year-old Elizabeth queen. More than a year later, on June 2, 1953, she was formally crowned at Westminster Abbey in the first British coronation to be televised. Members of the royal family represent numerous organizations and charities worldwide. More than 3,000 groups list a royal as a patron or president. In recent years, the queen was the patron of over 600 organizations, with the causes including the environment, education and health. Being a member of the royal family means attending numerous gatherings from sport and charity to gardening. However, as an avid racegoer and owner of several horses, Elizabeth especially looked forward to attending the Royal Ascot race in Berkshire, a county west of London, every June. Ceremony and pageantry are a core part of the British royal family. Among the regular duties Elizabeth carried out were making the annual Christmas speech and attending \"Trooping the Colour.\" Elizabeth wasn't alone in undertaking national duties. Elizabeth's travels circled the world several times. She met countless leading figures inside and out of Europe. She met with every U.S. president from Harry S. Truman to Joe Biden (in June 2021) except Lyndon Johnson. Elizabeth's relationship with the British public was almost always warm, although she was criticized for remaining at Balmoral Castle in Scotland for several days after the 1997 death of Diana rather than to immediately return to London. The family later said they stayed at Balmoral to protect and prepare the grieving Princes William and Harry, then 15 and 12, for their mother's funeral. In June 2002, the U.K. celebrated 50 years of Elizabeth's reign. Celebrations were held across the country and the queen and the Duke of Edinburgh traveled to every region of the U.K. and the Commonwealth to mark the occasion. On Nov. 20, 1992, the queen's 45th wedding anniversary, a fire at Windsor Castle caused extensive damage that took years to repair. But that was just one of a string of events that prompted the queen declare 1992 to be \"annus horribilis.\" Prince Andrew's separation with the former Sarah Ferguson was announced in March. The next month, Princess Anne divorced Capt. Mark Phillips. In June, Princess Diana's tell-all book was published. Its revelations included husband Charles' affair with Camilla Parker-Bowles. During the coronavirus outbreak, the queen delivered a rare video speech on April 5, 2020, to promise her subjects that they will prevail over the coronavirus. \"We will succeed \u2014 and that success will belong to every one of us. We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return,\" she said from Windsor Castle. Aside from horses, another animal the queen loved was the Pembroke Welsh corgi. As her husband was undergoing treatment for his final illness in early 2021, the queen acquired two puppies, a corgi she named Muick and a dorgi, a cross with a dachshund, she called Fergus. They were named, respectively, after Loch Muick on the Balmoral estate and her late uncle Fergus Bowes-Lyon, who was killed during World War I. Sadly, Fergus the pup died of a heart problem in May at age 5 months. Being a royal, keeping up with appearances and official photographs was just one of the many duties the queen undertook. The queen sat alone as her husband's casket was held by a military honor guard at his funeral at Windsor Castle's St. George's Chapel. Philip died April 9, 2021, at age 99. The funeral was four days before Elizabeth's 95th birthday. The 96-year-old monarch made an appearance in June on the balcony of Buckingham Palace during the first day of her Platinum Jubilee, marking the 70th anniversary of her accession to the throne. She waved to tens of thousands of people gathered below and watched an aviation display in her honor, but was not able to attend many of the events that took place over the four days of celebration due to her declining health. Elizabeth appointed Liz Truss as prime minister on Sept. 6 during a meeting at her Balmoral Castle in Scotland. The meeting was part of a routine in which the queen fulfilled her constitutional role of appointing a new prime minister \u2014 a sequence of events she oversaw 15 times. However, she broke with tradition and appointed Truss from Scotland rather than traveling to Buckingham Palace, as is typical."},

The quintessential American SUV brand announced the new vehicles Thursday along with plans for half of its U.S. sales, and all of its European sales, to be all-electric vehicles by 2030. The sales targets are in line with prior ones announced by Jeep's parent company, Stellantis. Jeep executives said the new EV models will be additions to the brand's lineup, not replacements for current models such as its flagship Wrangler off-road SUV. The announcements make for Jeep's most detailed and aggressive electrification plans to date. Previously, the brand was largely focusing on plug-in hybrid electric vehicles that offer all-electric driving in addition to a traditional internal combustion engine. \"Our goal is very clear: Become the global leader in SUV electrification,\" Jeep CEO Christian Meunier said during a media briefing. The company plans to achieve that goal by 2025. The Recon \u2013 a \"brother\" to the Wrangler \u2013 and the electric Grand Wagoneer, called the \"S,\" are expected to go into production in 2024, Jeep said. The automaker is targeting a range of 400 miles on a single charge, 600 horsepower and a 0-60 mph time of around 3.5 seconds for the electric Grand Wagoneer S. The brand did not announce performance expectations for the Recon beyond saying it will offer Wrangler-like off-road capability. Jeep also plans to offer four new EVs in Europe by 2025, including a small SUV called the Avenger that will not be sold in the U.S. Meunier declined to say how many of the vehicles would be sold in both North America and Europe. The Avenger, which is smaller than the brand's entry-level Jeep Renegade, will arrive in European showrooms in early 2023, according to the company. Jeep plans for every vehicle in its lineup to offer some form of \"electrification\" by 2025. That could include hybrid, plug-in hybrid electric or all-electric models. The company declined to forecast what part of its sales will be powered by traditional gasoline-powered engine by 2025 or 2030. Jeep currently offers plug-in hybrid electric versions of its Wrangler and Grand Cherokee in the U.S. The vehicles can travel in all-electric mode before an internal combustion engine kicks on to power the vehicles. The 4x4 electrified models are badged \"4xe,\" a play on the brand's off-road reputation combined with electrification. \"This is just the beginning of an exciting new chapter,\" said Jim Morrison, head of the Jeep brand in North America. \"4xe is the new 4x4.\" Jeep-parent Stellantis' overall electrification strategy includes investing 30 billion euros, now worth $30.1 billion, in electric vehicles and supporting technologies through 2025. The company expects to have 55 electrified vehicles in the U.S. and Europe by 2025 -- 40 all-electric models and 15 plug-in hybrid electric vehicles."},

Here's why America still can't agree on charter schools", "paragraphs": " Whether it's student loan forgiveness or banning books, education policy in the United States can get contentious. One controversial education policy that goes back to the 1990s is the charter school. A charter school is a publicly funded school that is established by a private group. The group creates a contract with the state and local government, which lays out specific accountability requirements. The government has the ability to shut the school down if it doesn't meet those standards. What's more, these schools are exempt from certain state laws and regulations that traditional public schools must follow, but they are expected to meet educational standards. \"We have more autonomy to be able to have a more flexible budget and make just different academic decisions,\" said Natalie Wiltshire, chief operating officer at KIPP Philadelphia Public Schools. KIPP, which stands for the \"Knowledge Is Power Program,\" is the largest charter management organization in the U.S., according to the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools. Nearly 3,000 students attend KIPP schools in Philadelphia. Admission is determined through a lottery system, with 97% of the students identifying as Black or African American and 76% qualifying for free or reduced lunch. \"KIPP has changed my life immensely,\" said Daniel Harris, a KIPP alumnus who is now a teacher at KIPP West Philadelphia Elementary Academy. \"My family was lower income, but I know that's not what [my teachers] saw me as. They saw me as a person who cared about his education, cared about his future, and wanted the best for himself and the people around him. That's what KIPP was about.\" At the organizational level, though, critics say charter schools harm the wider public school district, due to funding and transparency concerns. \"I'm opposed to publicly funded charter schools that are run privately,\" said Joseph Roy, superintendent of schools at the school district in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. \"Don't tell me you're a public school if you're not governed by the public.\" When a child leaves a district-run public school, the tax dollars follow that student to the charter school. Opponents of charter schools say even though the student is leaving the school, it doesn't reduce the traditional public school's costs. \"What winds up happening is there is a downward spiral because as the money goes out with kids, the services the district can provide become less and less,\" said Carol Burris, executive director of the Network for Public Education, an advocacy group that is outspoken against charter schools. \"So more parents leave for charter schools. And it puts some districts in critical places where they're really not able to service the kids that they have.\" \"Right now we're operating parallel school systems and at some point it's going to break,\" Burris said. Watch the video above to learn why charter schools are still so controversial. "},

BYD signed a contract Thursday to buy land and build a factory for new energy passenger cars in an industrial park run by local giant WHA Group, according to press releases. The companies did not disclose an investment amount. New energy includes pure battery and hybrid power. The news comes as BYD is expanding quickly into other countries. Notably, the company plans to enter the passenger car market in Japan \u2014 home to auto giant Toyota \u2014 by selling three electric car models to local customers next year. BYD said it announced in early August its official entry into Thailand's passenger car market. The company said the new factory is set to begin operations in 2024, building cars for the local market and for export to countries such as those in Southeast Asia. The cars will also be exported to Europe, WHA said. When the factory opens, annual production capacity will be about 150,000 vehicles, both companies said. WHA noted that by 2030, electric vehicles are expected to account for 30% of Thailand's total car production \u2014 or 700,000 such cars a year. Over roughly the last year, BYD has made many announcements about electric passenger car sales to countries such as Brazil, Australia, Singapore and Norway. Some mark the brand's entry to those markets, although it's unclear whether BYD is selling a meaningful number of cars there yet. For years, much of BYD's business, especially overseas, has focused on commercial vehicles such as buses. But in the last few years the company has quickly become an electric vehicle giant in China, the world's largest auto market. BYD said it sold more than 487,000 purely battery-powered passenger cars for the first eight months of the year \u2014 more than triple the number sold during the same period last year. For a rough comparison, the latest figures from electric car maker Tesla show the company delivered 564,743 vehicles in the first six months of the year. That's up 46% from a year ago. Unlike Tesla's handful of premium-priced models, BYD's numerous models cover a range of prices. BYD has said it stopped producing oil-fueled vehicles since March, and focused instead on battery-powered and hybrid vehicles. As of April 2021, BYD said all of its pure electric vehicles will use the company's self-developed \"Blade\" battery that was first installed in its popular Han luxury sedan."},

Oil futures also rose slightly Friday morning, after falling over worries about slowing demand. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen seized an opportunity at a Ford plant in Michigan to tout the Biden administration's economic track record as better than people might think. The biggest thing weighing on the president's approval ratings is voters' low opinion of how he's handled the economy, particularly as inflation surged. But as gas prices have gone down, Biden's ratings have started to tick back up, and the administration is keen to promote some wins ahead of the midterms. \"Taken together, the bipartisan infrastructure law, the CHIPS Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act authorized among the most significant investments our country has ever made,\" Yellen said Thursday. \"I believe firmly, they will help us achieve stable sustainable growth, and they'll move us toward a fairer and more resilient economy.\" Electric vehicle giant Tesla is considering whether to open a lithium-refining facility in Texas, months after CEO Elon Musk said the company may have to refine its own lithium as prices for the resource have soared.

Queen Elizabeth II died Thursday at age 96, concluding a 70-year reign that covered Britain's recovery from World War II, the final decline of the empire, Margaret Thatcher's battles with trade unions, the formation of the European Union and the U.K.'s exit from it, and the Covid pandemic. Elizabeth's passing marks a new era of uncertainty for Britain, writes CNBC's Karen Gilchrist. Just days before her death, the queen met with a new prime minister, Liz Truss, who is tasked with taming the most challenging economy the nation has encountered in years. The pound hit a 37-year low this week, and Truss's government is aiming to alleviate the country's cost-of-living crisis with caps on energy bills. It'll be tough medicine, and Elizabeth won't be there to rally Britons' morale. That's up to King Charles now. The Emmys are Monday, and Apple TV+ is a contender for several major awards.

DWAC had already twice adjourned the meeting earlier in the day after previously adjourning it Tuesday. The deadline for the merger was set for Thursday. The vote could decide the fate of a $1.3 billion cash infusion from DWAC's public offering and Trump Media and Technology Group's potential listing on the stock market. DWAC confirmed Thursday that ARC Global Investments II, a company controlled by DWAC CEO Patrick Orlando, initiated a built-in, three-month extension by depositing $2.8 million into DWAC's trust account. The deposit, equivalent to 10 cents per share, pushes the merger deadline to Dec. 8, around two months after the next scheduled special meeting. Given the extra time, DWAC ended its statement by rallying investors to vote in favor of the extension of up to a year. Following the Thursday adjournment, Orlando posted t o Truth Social a reference to \"Star Trek\" along with a photo of a tomahawk steak, a selfie with a white Ford Bronco as well as quotes from Trump and Thomas Jefferson. Shares of DWAC seesawed on light volume after the market closed. Trump Media owns Truth Social, which was founded by the former president after he was banned from Twitter following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Digital World had previously warned that the vote's failure could result in the SPAC's liquidation. The built-in extension buys the company some more time to gather votes and, if liquidation does occur, increases share payout from around $10.20 to around $10.30. DWAC had been scheduled to announce the vote results Tuesday, but Orlando adjourned its special meeting after just two minutes to provide more times for voting. Earlier that day, Reuters had reported that DWAC had failed to garner the votes necessary for the extension, citing sources familiar with the matter. DWAC needs 65% of shareholders to support the extension of the merger deadline. While 20% of those shares are held by Orlando through ARC Global Investments, he says the deal has attracted many retail investors. Orlando has been rallying those investors to vote on Truth Social. The deal has also been the subject of an SEC probe into potential securities violations, stemming from reports that representatives from Trump Media and DWAC discussed the merger prior to DWAC's public offering. Trump Media and Technology Group blamed the SEC for the merger delay, alleging that \"meaningful feedback\" from the commission is long overdue. \"In the interests of simple fairness, the SEC needs to set aside any improper political considerations and bring its review to a swift conclusion,\" a statement from Trump Media read. CNBC reached out to the SEC for comment Thursday. Trump Media has denied reports of financial strife that alleged that the company owed over $1 million to a contractor. The former president has indicated that company may not need the cash infusion from the DWAC deal. \"In any event, I don't need financing, 'I'm really rich!' Private company anyone???\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Saturday."},

The all-electric crossover is scheduled to go on sale in the U.S. next fall, starting at around $30,000 \u2013 a price level many automakers haven't been able to achieve as the cost to build electric vehicles and the batteries needed to power them continues to rise. GM executives expect the 2024 Equinox EV, officially unveiled Thursday, to become a high-volume seller for the Detroit automaker, as it transitions to exclusively offer electric cars and trucks by 2035. \"We think this is our big opportunity here to really start to get a massive adoption, and we have that expectation with the price; the volume that we expect to do,\" Scott Bell, global vice president of Chevrolet, said during a media briefing. \"This is a game changer for us and for the industry.\" Bell said Equinox EV production at GM's Ramos Arizpe plant in Mexico will ramp up gradually in the coming years. The Equinox EV is expected to join electric versions of the Silverado pickup, Blazer SUV, and the less expensive and smaller Bolt EV and EUV models for Chevrolet. GM CEO Mary Barra last year said the Detroit automaker can \"absolutely\" catch industry leader Tesla in U.S. sales of electric vehicles by 2025. Those plans include more than 1 million units of EV production capacity in China and North America, each, by that time. Barra on Thursday told CNBC's Phil LeBeau that the automaker expects to ramp up production of the Equinox EV far more quickly than its current EVs. She said the vehicle should be close to full production by the first quarter of 2024. The automaker began production of battery cells this year through a joint venture with LG Energy Solution at a plant in Ohio, speeding up EV output. Two other U.S. plants battery plants are also under construction, with a fourth plant expected to be announced soon. \"It is a big year for us. ... This battery plant that we have in Ohio is going to enable us to really start scaling because we're going to have the cells being made in this country,\" Barra said. \"Next year's a huge year. I can't wait because we're going to unleash the power of General Motors.\" The expected starting price of the Equinox EV at roughly $30,000 is less than half the $66,000-plus average transaction price of electric vehicles currently on sale, according to Cox Automotive. The price also brings the Equinox in line with gas-powered compact crossovers/SUVs at an average price of $35,300, according to the auto forecasting and research company. \"An electric Equinox is important to GM because it is a high-volume model in the most popular segment in the industry,\" said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Cox. \"We know from our studies that price of EVs is the No. 1 obstacle to EV adoption with range and charging infrastructure falling. \"Affordable EVs are critical to proliferating EVs.\" The Chevy Bolt, which went on sale in December 2016, was expected to be GM's first affordable, mainstream EV but its annual sales have yet to top 25,000 \u2013 a far cry from mainstream sales such as the gas-powered Equinox at hundreds of thousands of units per year. \"The Bolt has seen mild success but was never really intended as a high-volume EV model,\" said Paul Waatti, manager of industry analysis at AutoPacific. \"The funky design and market positioning require a bit of a unique buyer.\" The Equinox EV will enter a much larger market than the smaller Bolt models. The new crossover is powered by GM's next-generation Ultium electric vehicle platform that's expected to enable more technologies and capabilities compared with the outgoing battery technology of the Bolt models. The Equinox EV is expected to offer between 250 miles and 300 miles of range, depending on the model and battery. A standard front-wheel-drive Equinox is projected to offer 210 horsepower and 242 foot-pounds of torque, with all-wheel-drive models achieving 290-horsepower and 346 foot-pounds of torque. Despite the name, the Equinox EV shares little to nothing with the traditional gas-powered model. It has more in common with the recently unveiled Chevrolet Blazer, which also utilizes GM's Ultium platform and batteries. The Equinox EV will feature better performance than its gas-powered namesake but falls shy of the performance of the Blazer EV, which starts at $45,000 and offers up to 557 horsepower and 648 pounds-foot of torque. The interiors of the electric vehicles also are similar, including a 17.7-inch-diagonal infotainment touch screen that's standard on the Blazer and optional on the Equinox."},

NASA's associate administrator, Jim Free, noted that crucial to those requests is whether the Space Force will sign off on extending the requirements previously set around the batteries for the rocket's flight termination system, needed in in the event of a problem mid-launch. \"We're trying to plan a path forward if we're allowed to extend our battery retest requirements,\" Free said. NASA needs a waiver from the Eastern Range to move forward with an attempt on either of those launch dates. Without the waiver or completion of the hydrogen leak work, NASA faces the Artemis I mission delaying to October."},

Here\u2019s how to prepare", "paragraphs": " After boosting paid parental leave during the pandemic, many companies are now cutting or reducing the popular employee benefit. In 2022, organizations with paid maternity leave dropped to 35% from 53% in 2020, according to the Society for Human Resource Management's employee benefits survey. And fewer than one-third, 27%, now provide paid paternity leave, down from 44% in 2020. \"A lot of these firms are now trying to get back to pre-pandemic norms,\" said Michelle Long, a policy analyst at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation.

Currently, there isn't a federal paid leave program, and only 11 states plus the District of Columbia offer the benefit, typically funded by payroll taxes, according to data from the National Conference of State Legislatures. \"This is a very, very expensive offering, particularly for small and medium-sized companies,\" said Johnny Taylor, Jr., president and CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management, explaining that some firms may pay wages for the employee on leave and a replacement at the same time. However, as the labor market softens, \"the game is changing a little bit,\" he said, and companies are cutting back on previously enhanced paid parental leave policies. Whether you're a current employee or weighing job offers, it's important to know the details of your company's parental leave policy if you're planning to grow your family, Taylor said. \"Oftentimes, the temptation is to take a job with the highest salary without factoring in things like their paid leave offering,\" he said. If you're interviewing, ask for an overview of the company's full benefits package, he suggested. While using vacation time for parental leave is another option, he urged future parents to weigh the pros and cons before depleting paid days off for the year. \"Nurturing a new baby is not a vacation,\" Taylor said. \"If you spend all your vacation time doing that, you're going to burn out.\" Future parents may also consider coordinating benefits or taking paid leave separately, suggested Nicole Sullivan, a certified financial planner and co-founder of Prism Planning Partners in Libertyville, Illinois. \"Fully understanding and coordinating all company benefits is another major help \u2014 things like flexible spending or dependent care accounts and medical benefits,\" she said. \"Many companies have benefits open enrollment in November, so it's a good time for parents and parents-to-be to review,\" Sullivan added."},

These 5 charts show how it went", "paragraphs": " It was a pricey and chaotic summer for air travel. A bigger share of flights were delayed or canceled during the main late spring and summer travel season, which runs from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day, compared with the same period of pre-pandemic 2019. Fares surged along with fuel prices and as millions of consumers booked trips after two years of forgoing flights. Domestic round trips averaged $342 between May and September, nearly 11% more than the same period in 2019, according to fare-tracker Hopper. Labor shortages made it even harder for airlines to recover from routine events. Overambitious carriers trimmed their packed schedules to give their operations more breathing room. Overwhelmed European hubs capped passenger numbers. Even airline employee travel perks were scaled back. Government agencies and airlines sparred over who was to blame. And on Sept. 1, the Department of Transportation published a dashboard that spells out what customers are owed when airlines delay or cancel their flights. Fares are finally starting to decline along with temperatures, but vacation travel demand is still strong, executives said this week. \"We're seeing a really strong September,\" Patrick Quayle, United Airlines ' senior vice president of global network planning and alliances, said at a Cowen industry conference this week. \"It does not appear that summer has come to an end. It's that strong.\" As airlines prepare for the fall \u2014 and busy year-end holidays \u2014 here's how they handled the heat this summer: Passenger numbers this summer surged compared with the past two years. During Labor Day weekend, the Transportation Security Administration screened about 8.76 million people, marking the first holiday weekend since the Covid pandemic began that was busier than one in 2019. Airlines canceled or delayed a greater share of their flights compared with 2019. Thinner staffing levels and training backups meant they had fewer crew members to step in when scheduled employees like pilots reached federally mandated workday limits. Operations improved in August and over the important Labor Day weekend for some airlines. Delta Air Lines reduced cancellations by 25% in August compared with July, CEO Ed Bastian said in a staff memo Thursday, which was reviewed by CNBC. Over Labor Day the carrier canceled 15 mainline flights out of 16,636 departures, he said. Airport delays varied around the country but some of the biggest hubs had greater shares of late-arriving flights, often driven by spring and summer storms. Traveler complaints to the Transportation Department soared, along with flight disruptions. By some metrics, however, like mishandled baggage, U.S. airlines performed similarly to 2019. Domestic round-trip fares surged this spring, reaching a peak in May of $404, up 25% from three years ago, according to Hopper data. But a drop in prices, combined with a seasonal lull as business travel remains below 2019 volumes, is making for some fall deals. Domestic airfare is averaging $299 in September, still up 2% from the same month three years ago. And airline executives expect travel demand to spike around the holidays. \"Though we'll slow down for a bit following the summer peak, the holiday travel season will be here before you know it,\" American Airlines COO David Seymour told employees this week."},

Airlines were prohibited from laying off staff as a condition of accepting $54 billion in taxpayer aid to weather the Covid-19 pandemic. Travel demand collapsed in the early days of the crisis. However, carriers were able to urge workers to take early retirement packages or extended leaves of absence. Thousands took them up on the offer, including hundreds of pilots. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., chairwoman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, and James Clyburn, D-S.C., chairman of the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, on Thursday asked the Treasury Department's watchdog to review how airlines used the Covid-19 aid and whether it was used for buyouts or staff reductions, according to a letter reviewed by CNBC. Airlines for America, a trade group which represents American, Delta, United, Southwest and other major U.S. carriers, said the funds from the Payroll Support Program for airlines \"went only to the paychecks of employees, as stipulated by law, and carriers have paid back the government loans.\" \"Without the PSP, our aviation system would look like Europe, Canada or other areas that did not have any similar program,\" the group said in a statement. \"Or even worse, if not for the PSP, we may not be flying at all.\" When travel demand rebounded sharply this year, airlines found themselves short-staffed, including in cockpits. As a result, some airlines, including American and United, cut flights or grounded dozens of planes, particularly to small cities. Shorter routes are flown generally by regional airlines, and airlines have hired hundreds of new pilots from those smaller carriers to fill their own ranks. Labor shortages this year have made it harder for airlines to recover from routine issues such as bad weather. \"As a result of pilot shortages, thousands of flights have been delayed or canceled, wreaking havoc on travel plans for millions of American taxpayers,\" the lawmakers wrote in their letter to Treasury Department Deputy Inspector General Richard Delmar. Delmar confirmed that he received the letter and said his office plans to respond to the lawmakers in the coming days. The Treasury Department declined to comment. Maloney and Clyburn asked the watchdog for preliminary results by Sept. 22. U.S. carriers began 2020 with 456,398 full-time equivalent employees, which fell to 363,354 in November of that year, according to the Department of Transportation. Airlines have been on a hiring spree for more than a year, and in June had 455,642 full-time equivalent employees."},

Animated movies released theatrically have floundered at the box office in the wake of the pandemic. At first, parents were reticent to bring kids back to cinemas, but now it seems that lackluster titles and an increase in children's content on streaming have contributed to keeping families at home. Disney has exacerbated this issue since movie theaters reopened, as it has placed the majority of its new Pixar films on Disney+ including \"Turning Red,\" \"Soul\" and \"Luca.\" While these decisions were made at time when vaccinations were either not available to children and moviegoing foot traffic was slow, it trained consumers to expect these titles on streaming. It's part of the reason that \"Lightyear\" had a lackluster opening in theaters this summer. Of course, the film was also hurt by a confusing premise that deviated from what made the Toy Story franchise so special. Disney revealed ew titles from Pixar and its Walt Disney Animation Studio as well as films associated with its live-action remakes during Friday's panel. It will also share which films will head to theaters and which will arrive by way of Disney+. Pete Docter, the chief creative officer of Pixar, took the stage at the D23 Expo to announce new titles from the animation studio that will arrive in theaters and on Disney+ in the coming years. \"Elemental,\" arriving in summer 2023, tells the story of a bustling metropolis where earth, air, fire and water elements live. But when a fire girl and a water boy develop a connection the two must navigate how to interact while being polar opposites. Director Peter Sohn noted the film also touches on themes of immigration and finding your place in the world. The company is launching its first ever long-form series on Disney+ called \"Win or Lose.\" The show is the brain child of two storyboard artists and tells the story of the Pickles softball team in the week ahead of their championship game. Each episode takes place during the same week, but from a perspective of a different main character. \"Elio\" is a new project from the studio that centers on an 11-year-old named Elio who is just trying to fit in. His mother is working on a top secret military project to decode alien messages, but its Elio who accidentally makes first contact and becomes the de facto emissary for Earth. The film will debut in spring 2024. Amy Poehler joined Docter on stage to announce Pixar will be making a sequel to 2015's \"Inside Out.\" Riley is now a teenager and there are new emotions joining the mix. The movie arrives in summer 2024. Jennifer Lee, chief creative officer of Walt Disney Animation Studios, announced several new projects from the studio. To start, Lee said \"Zootopia+\" will arrive in November. The show is a series of shorts following major characters from the 2016 feature film. Disney is partnering with Kugali Media to bring \"Iwaju\" to Disney+. The series is set in Nigeria and follows a young heiress named Tola and a poor boy named Kole. It arrives on the streaming service in 2023. The studio shared a trailer of \"Strange Worlds,\" which arrives in theaters Thanksgiving 2022. The film centers on the Clades, a family of explorers, who must rely on each other in spite of their differences to traverse an uncharted and treacherous new land. \"Wish\" is Disney Animations 2023 feature film. It explores how the dreaming star, upon which so many Disney characters have wished upon, came to be. The film is set within the Kingdom of Roses and follows Asha, an optimist with a sharp wit. Asha sees a darkness in the kingdom that no one else does, so in a moment of desperation she makes a passionate plea to the stars. This calls down an actual star from the sky named Star with magical wish-granting powers. Asha is played by Ariana DeBose as Asha and Alan Tudyk as Valentino, a goat. DeBose sang an original song from the film and Tudyk ran through his repertoire of Disney characters including Duke Weaselton from \"Frozen,\" Hei Hei from \"Moana\" and King Candy from \"Wreck-it Ralph.\" Ahead of reveals about its animated content, Disney unveiled new trailers for \"Hocus Pocus 2,\" which arrives on Disney+ Sept. 30, as well as \"Disenchanted,\" the sequel to 2007's \"Enchanted,\" out on the streaming service Nov 24. On the heels of the release of \"Pinocchio\" on Disney+ on Thursday, the studio announced a slew of new additions to its catalog of Disney live-action remakes. \"Peter Pan & Wendy\" starring Alexander Molony as Peter, Ever Anderson as Wendy and Alyssa Wapanatahk as Tiger Lily is slated for release on Disney+ in 2023. Jude Law portrays Captain Hook. \"Haunted Mansion\" is slated to arrive in theaters March 10, 2023. Directed by Justin Simien, a former Disneyland cast member, the film is filled with Easter eggs culled from the famous Disney parks ride. During the panel, Simien announced that Jamie Lee Curtis will star as Madam Leota in the film. Barry Jenkin's formerly untitled Lion King project is called \"Mufasa: The Lion King\" and tells the origin story of Mufasa from cub to king. Clips shared with audiences at the D23 Expo shows the same stunning visuals as 2019's \"The Lion King\" and will arrive in theaters in 2024. The company also shared a brief glimpse of \"Snow White\" due out in theaters in 2024. The film stars Rachel Zegler as the title character and Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen. Fans erupted in applause when Gadot took the stage. The \"Wonder Woman\" actress said it was fun to play the villain, having been so often cast in more heroic roles. Both Zegler and Anderson noted that the studio worked to give classic characters like Snow White and Wendy more agency and provide a modern take on these classic tales. Rob Marshall, the director of Disney's remake of \"The Little Mermaid,\" shared the entire sequence of \"Part of Your World\" from the film. Halle Bailey's performance received raucous applause and a standing ovation when she stepped out on stage. The film arrives in theaters May 26, 2023."},
{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/11/where-walmart-amazon-target-are-spending-billions-in-slowing-economy.html", "title": "Where Walmart, Amazon and Target are spending billions in a slowing economy", "paragraphs": " When the economy slows down, the classic response for consumer businesses is to cut back: slow hiring, maybe lay off workers, slash marketing, or even slow the pace of technology investment, delaying projects until after business has picked up again. But that's not at all what America's troubled retail sector is doing this year. With the S&P Retail Index down nearly 30% this year, most of the industry is boosting investment in capital spending by double digits, including industry leaders Walmart and Amazon.com. Among the top tier, only struggling clothier Gap and home-improvement chain Lowe's are cutting back significantly. At electronics retailer Best Buy, first-half profits fell by more than half \u2013 but investment rose 37 percent. \"There is definitely concern and awareness about costs, but there is a prioritization happening,\" said Thomas O'Connor, vice president of supply chain-consumer retail research at consulting firm Gartner. \"A lesson has been taken from the aftermath of the financial crisis,\" O'Connor said. That lesson? Investments made by big-spending leaders like Walmart, Amazon and Home Depot are likely to result in taking customers from weaker rivals next year, when consumer discretionary cash flow is forecast to rebound from a year-long 2022 drought and revive shopping after spending on goods actually shrank early this year. After the 2007-2009 downturn, 60 companies Gartner classified as \"efficient growth companies\" that invested through the crisis saw earnings double between 2009 and 2015, while other companies' profits barely changed, according to a 2019 report on 1,200 U.S. and European firms. Companies have taken that data to heart, with a recent Gartner survey of finance executives across industries showing that investments in technology and workforce development are the last expenses companies plan to cut as the economy struggles to keep recent inflation from causing a new recession. Budgets for mergers, environmental sustainability plans and even product innovation are taking a back seat, the Gartner data shows. Today, some retailers are improving how supply chains work between the stores and their suppliers. That's a focus at Home Depot, for example. Others, like Walmart, are driving to improve in-store operations so that shelves are restocked more quickly and fewer sales are lost. The trend toward more investment has been building for a decade, but was catalyzed by the Covid pandemic, Progressive Policy Institute economist Michael Mandel said. \"Even before the pandemic, retailers were shifting from investments in structures to active investments in equipment, technology and software,\" Mandel said. \"[Between 2010 and 2020], software investment in the retail sector rose by 123%, compared to a 16% gain in manufacturing.\" At Walmart, money is pouring into initiatives including VizPick, an augmented-reality system linked to worker cell phones that lets associates restock shelves faster. The company boosted capital spending 50% to $7.5 billion in the first half of its fiscal year, which ends in January. Its capital spending budget this year is expected to rise 26 percent to $16.5 billion, CFRA Research analyst Arun Sundaram said. \"The pandemic obviously changed the entire retail environment,\" Sundaram said, forcing Walmart and others to be efficient in their back offices and embrace online channels and in-store pickup options even more. \"It made Walmart and all the other retailers improve their supply chains. You see more automation, less manual picking [in warehouses] and more robots.\" Last week, Amazon announced its latest warehouse robotics acquisition, Belgian firm Cloostermans, which offers technology to help move and stack heavy palettes and goods, as well as package products together for delivery. Home Depot's campaign to revamp its supply chain has been underway for several years, O'Connor said. Its One Supply chain effort is actually hurting profits for now, according to the company's financial disclosures, but it's central to both operating efficiency and a key strategic goal \u2013 creating deeper ties to professional contractors, who spend far more than the do-it-yourselfers who have been Home Depot's bread and butter. \"To serve our pros, it's really about removing friction through a multitude of enhanced product offerings and capabilities,\" executive vice president Hector Padilla told analysts on Home Depot's second-quarter call. \"These new supply chain assets allow us to do that at a different level.\" Some broadline retailers are more focused on refreshing an aging store brand. At Kohl's, the highlight of this year's capital spending budget is an expansion of the firm's relationship with Sephora, which is adding mini-stores within 400 Kohl's stores this year. The partnership helps the middle-market retailer add an element of flair to its otherwise stodgy image, which contributed to its relatively weak sales growth in the first half of the year, said Landon Luxembourg, a retailing expert at consulting firm Third Bridge. First-half investment more than doubled this year at Kohl's. Roughly $220 million of the increase in Kohl's spending was related to investment in beauty inventory to support the 400 Sephora shops opening in 2022, according to chief financial officer Jill Timm said. \"We'll continue that into next year. \u2026We're looking forward to working with Sephora on that solution to all of our stores,\" she told analysts on the company's most recent earnings call in mid-August. Target is spending $5 billion this year as it adds 30 stores and upgrades another 200, bringing its tally of stores renovated since 2017 to more than half of the chain. It also is expanding its own beauty partnership first unveiled in 2020, with Ulta Beauty, adding 200 in-store Ulta centers en route to having 800. And the biggest spender of all is Amazon.com, which had over $60 billion in capital expenditures in 2021. While Amazon's reported capital spending numbers include its cloud computing division, it spent nearly $31 billion on property and equipment in the first half of the year \u2014 up from an already record breaking 2021 \u2014 even though the investment made the company's free cash flow turn negative. That is enough to make even Amazon tap the brakes a little bit, with chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky telling investors Amazon is shifting more of its investment dollars to the cloud computing division. This year, it estimates roughly 40% of spending will support warehouses and transportation capacity, down from last year's combined 55%. It also plans to spend less on worldwide stores \u2014 \"to better align with customer demand,\" Olsavksy told analysts after its most recent earnings \u2014 already a much smaller budget item on a percentage basis. At Gap \u2014 which has seen its shares declined by nearly 50% this year \u2014 executives defended their cuts in capital spending, saying they need to defend profits this year and hope to rebound in 2023. \"We also believe there's an opportunity to slow down more meaningfully the pace of our technology and digital platform investments to better optimize our operating profits,\" chief financial officer Katrina O'Connell told analysts after its most recent earnings. And Lowe's deflected an analyst's question about spending cuts, saying it could continue to take market share from smaller competitors. Lowe's has been the better stock market performer compared to Home Depot over the past one-year and year-to-date periods, though both have seen sizable declines in 2022. \"Home improvement is a $900 billion marketplace,\" Lowe's CEO Marvin Ellison said, without mentioning Home Depot. \"And I think it's easy to just focus on the two largest players and determine the overall market share gain just based on that, but this is a really fragmented marketplace.\""},

The Restaurant Brands International chain unveiled a turnaround plan for its U.S. business in Las Vegas at its annual franchisee convention. The investments are expected to weigh on its adjusted earnings per share for 2022 and 2023 by 10 to 12 cents annually. The company expects the investments to start paying off by 2025. Wall Street analysts surveyed by Refinitiv expect earnings per share of $3.24 in 2023. In the second quarter, Burger King reported flat U.S. same-store sales growth, trailing behind rivals McDonald's and Wendy's. The burger chain has been reporting lackluster U.S. sales over the last year, causing concern for Restaurant Brands CEO Jose Cil. In his tenure as chief executive, Cil has also spearheaded efforts to revive Canadian demand for Tim Hortons, Burger King's sister chain. A year ago, Cil also tapped former Domino's Pizza executive Tom Curtis as the new president for Burger King's U.S. and Canadian restaurants. Early changes to Burger King included slimming its menu to speed up drive-thru times and cutting down its paper coupons to push customers to use its mobile app. Now Burger King is preparing to make even bolder changes. It's planning to spend $200 million to fund remodels of roughly 800 locations. Another $50 million will go toward upgrading about 3,000 restaurants with technology, kitchen equipment and building enhancements. The company has more than 7,000 Burger King locations in the U.S. Historically, remodeled restaurants see an average sales increase of 12% in their first year and outperform older locations over time, according to Burger King. The company is hoping that being more selective and strategic with its projects will produce even stronger sales growth, although it could take longer to see results. \"We might see remodels start to hit the market mid-2023 and going forward. It should really be a gradual ramp of the business over the course of the couple of years,\" Cil told CNBC. Burger King will also increase its U.S. advertising fund's budget by 30% by investing $120 million over the next two years. Those investments will start in the fourth quarter. \"We expect that to start having an impact on sales over the next quarter,\" Cil said. An additional $30 million will be spent through 2024 on improving its mobile app, exceeding the digital fees that franchisees pay to the company for the technology. Burger King's menu will also get a facelift. The company said it's built a multi-year blueprint for menu improvements, which include developing new Whopper flavors, betting on its Royal Chicken Crispy sandwich and investing in more employee training. The strategy has received support from franchisees operating 93% of its U.S. restaurants, according to Burger King. Operators will be chipping in their own money alongside the company for remodels and advertising. Curtis and h is team put together a group of franchisees, representing a range of regions and experience, to come up with the strategy over the last three to six months. \"There were many long nights and plane rides,\" Curtis said. In addition to the money they get from Burger King, franchisees making upgrades to their restaurants are expected to make comparabl e i nvestments to fund the projects. The company is also changing its incentive structure to encourage operators to make more extensive remodels, which can be costly and typically require a location to be temporarily shuttered. In the past, Burger King operators who remodeled their restaurants received discounts on their advertising and royalty fees for up to seven years. The new program will give franchisees cash once the project is completed, and let them choose how much of a discount they get on the royalties they pay to the company. If profitability targets are met, however, Burger King franchisees will have to pay higher fees toward the advertising fund."},

The firearms maker on Thursday had reported net sales to $84.4 million for its fiscal first quarter, a decrease of 69% from the same time last year. Smith & Wesson Chief Executive Officer Mark Smith blamed the \"challenging\" quarter on the return to normal demand levels and the company needing to correct inventory levels. \"The industry experienced our first normal summer slowdown in three years,\" Smith said in a press release. Additionally, he said manufacturer orders were \"artificially depressed\" as the company's partners sold through existing inventories. Demand for guns had surged in late 2021 and early 2022 amid the pandemic and societal civil unrest related to police killings of unarmed Black people and the presidential election. Analysts agreed with Smith's assessment of the normalization of firearm demand. \"Although disappointed with results that missed our estimates, we think the company remains disciplined in its approach to long-term growth and prudent management of channel inventory,\" a Lake Street analyst said in a note. Smith & Wesson has also been the subject of congressional scrutiny after lawmakers criticized the way gun manufacturers have marketed their products, especially to young men. For its fiscal quarter ended July 31, Smith & Wesson reported a net income of $3.3 million, dropping from $76.9 million in the year-ago period. Smith & Wesson's stock was down about 6% in morning trading. The company's shares were down about 25% so far this year as of Thursday's close."},

To clear products off shelves in the meantime, retailers including Macy's and Nordstrom have turned to markdowns that are cutting into profits. \"The retail environment's not pretty,\" Jeffries analyst Corey Tarlowe told CNBC. \"Inventories have been elevated. There's billions of dollars of excess apparel inventory that's floating out around there right now, and that's a problem.\" On Wednesday, American Eagle said it was suspending its dividend after comparable sales in the latest quarter fell 6% from a year ago. Chief Operating Officer Mike Mathias pointed to a \"slowdown in demand\" caused by the macroeconomic environment. Jen Foyle, the company's chief merchandising officer, said American Eagle's priorities are \"adjusting our assortments and rightsizing inventory.\" The need for markdowns to move inventory hurt American Eagle's bottom line, with the company posting earnings of 4 cents per share for the quarter ending July 30. That fell short of the 13 cents per share expected by analysts. On Thursday, Nordstrom Chief Financial Officer Anne Bramman also said at the Goldman Sachs Global Retailing Conference that discounts have been \"a lot deeper\" than the company had expected and that it could \"take a couple quarters\" to properly readjust. The department store operator in August had reported stronger sales for its second quarter, but slashed its financial forecast for the year citing a glut of inventory and slowing demand later in the quarter. Rival Macy's also last month slashed its revenue and earnings forecast for the year, with Chief Financial Officer Adrian Mitchell noting \"weakening apparel sales over the quarter as the consumer faces higher costs on essential goods, particularly grocery. At Thursday's Goldman conference, Mitchell said that the company has \"taken the markdowns necessary\" to help clear inventory. Other retailers including Wal-Mart, Target, Gap and Kohl's have faced similar problems with bloated inventories. Target cited its deep discounting to get rid of excess inventory when it reported a 90% decline in quarterly profit in August. Chief Financial Officer Michael Fiddelke said there was \"softness\" in apparel and other discretionary categories. Noting an inflation-wary consumer, Wal-Mart employed similarly aggressive markdowns to move items like clothing out of stores, which led to a significant cut in profit expectations. Gap and Kohl's, meanwhile, are looking to avoid some markdowns with a \"pack-and-hold\" strategy for certain items, which allows them to reserve excess inventory until demand rises. By 2023, Tarlowe the analyst said retailers might be able to adjust more quickly to demand as the supply chain normalizes. But for now, he said companies are struggling to adjust their offerings. \"All that product that was initially ordered for soft and cozy trends is now coming in. These retailers have been stuck with it. They're forced to clear it out. It's not in the right categories,\" Tarlowe said."},

Diego Luna stars as Cassian Andor, reprising his role from 2016's \"Rogue One,\" and is an executive producer on the project. Genevieve O'Reilly also returns as Mon Mothma. The series, which Kennedy described as a spy thriller, takes place five years before the events of \"Rogue One.\" Additional cast members include Adria Arjona as Bix, an on-and-off again love interest of Cassian, and Kyle Soller as Syril, a villainous member of the Galactic Empire. Dave Filoni, who ushered in a new age of Star Wars animation with \"Clone Wars,\" revealed a trailer for \"Tales of the Jedi,\" a series of six animated shorts, three focused on Ahsoka Tano and three on Count Dooku. Each short takes place at a different point in each charaters' life, bringing back characters like Qui-Gon Jinn, Anakin Skywalker and Mace Windu. Jon Favreau, Filoni's partner on \"The Mandalorian\" series, arrived to discuss the live-action \"Ahsoka\" series starring Rosario Dawson in the title role and share details on other projects the Lucasfilm team is working on. Favreau announced that Jon Watts, who directed \"Spider-Man: No Way Home,\" is helming \"Skeleton Crew,\" an upcoming Disney+ show set in the New Republic, along side Chris Ford. The series stars Jude Law and follows a group of four kids as they try to make their way home. Little else was shared about the project, which is currently in production. To celebrate the third season of \"The Mandalorian,\" Filoni and Favreau brought out fellow executive producer Rick Famuyiwa alongside the cast, including Pedro Pascal, Katee Sackhoff, Emily Swallow, Amy Sedaris and Giancarlo Esposito. Lucasfilm provided a teaser for the new season, which promises even more armored Mandalorians, high-octane action and lots of the child known as Grogu. The next season arrives on Disney+ in 2023. James Mangold the director of the fifth \"Indiana Jones\" showed footage of the next installment in the franchise, which features Harrison Ford in the title role. The action-packed clips showcased epic car chases and Ford racing through a subway on horseback. Ford, who was visibly emotional while on stage, received a standing ovation and said the new \"Indiana Jones\" is \"a movie that will kick your a--.\" He also noted that this will be he last turn as the archeologist adventurer saying, with a laugh, \"I will not fall down for you again.\" The film, which also stars Phoebe Waller-Bridge, arrives in cinemas on June 30, 2023. Warwick Davis, reprising his role as Willow, took the stage alongside Christian Slater and other members of the cast of \"Willow\" to share a trailer for the new Disney+ series. The new show is a sequel to the 1988 cult classic of the same name."},

Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige teased that his team has a plan for the next ten years of Marvel's cinematic universe, and plans to incorporate the Fantastic Four, X-Men and Deadpool into the mix of already established Marvel heroes. Here's a breakdown of what audiences can expect from Disney's Marvel Studios in the coming years: Kevin Feige, head of Marvel Studios, started his portion of the D23 Expo panel with a rendition of \"I Can Do This All Day\" from \"Rogers: The Musical,\" which appeared in the Disney+ series \"Hawkeye.\" Ryan Coogler, the director of \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,\" brought footage from the film, which is due out in theaters Nov. 11. The clips showed Queen Ramonda chastising the United Nations for trying to steal vibranium from Wakanda following the death of T'Challa. The footage showcased the power of the Dora Milaje and set the stage for an epic fight against Namor and the Atlanteans. \"Excited for you to walk out of the cinema and feel proud of what we brought to you,\" said Letitia Wright, who portrays Shuri in the film. Audiences got a quick glimpse at Riri Williams in the \"Wakanda Forever\" footage, but Marvel also shared a peek at the \"Ironheart\" Disney+ series, which is still in production. The clips showed Riri building bits of the Ironheart armor and Feige teased that the show will focus on the cross section of magic and technology. Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly and Johnathan Majors appeared on stage to discuss the upcoming \"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,\" the first film in phase 5 of the MCU. \"This thing is bananas,\" Rudd said. \"This is going to be unlike anything you've seen from us and not to mention that guy,\" he said, pointing to Majors, who portrays Kang. \"Throws this whole thing into such new territory.\" Footage shows the Lang, Van Dyne and Pym families being pulled into the quantum realm and faced with a terrible new foe: Kang the Conqueror. Gael Garcia Bernal and Laura Donnelly star in \"Werewolf by Night,\" special Marvel Studios presentation coming to Disney+ in October. The film, which is shot entirely black and white, harkens back to \"The Twilight Zone\" and old monster movies of the '30s and '40s. Early footage shown at D23 Expo suggests the film follows a group of monster hunters seeking out a monster among them. \"Secret Invasion\" follows a faction of shapeshifting aliens known as Skrulls who have infiltrated all aspects of life on Earth. The Skrulls first appeared in 2018's \"Captain Marvel,\" which was set in the '90s. Don Cheadle arrived to share footage from the upcoming Disney+ series filled with political intrigue and action. He also teased \"Armor Wars,\" a show that will begin shooting next year. Feige brought on the cast of \"Loki' to showcase a teaser trailer from the second season, which promises even more mischief. He announced Matt Shakman, the director of \"WandaVision,\" will officially direct the MCU's \"Fantastic Four\" feature film. \"Echo,\" a new Disney+ show that centers on a deaf female heroine, takes place after \"Hawkeye\" and features heavy use of American Sign Language. Footage from the series shows the return of Vincent D'Onofrio as King Pin. Alaqua Cox reprises her role as the title character. D'Onofrio, who had been on stage to promote \"Echo,\" was joined by Charlie Cox to share footage of Matthew Murdock aka Daredevil in \"She-Hulk.' No footage was shown from the show, as it has not begun filming. D'Onofrio will appear in the series. Anthony Mackie returns as Captain America in \"Captain America: New World Order.\" He was joined on stage by Danny Ramiez, who plays Joaquin Torres, Carl Lumbly as Isaiah Bradley and Tim Blacke Nelson as Samuel Sterns, aka the Leader. Feige announced the team that will be part of \"Thunderbolts.\" This includes Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, David Harbour as Red Guardian, Hannah John-Kamen as Ghost, Olga Kurylenko as Task Master, Wyatt Russel as John Walker aka U.S. Agent, Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova and Sebastian Stan as the Winter Soldier. \"It tells you all you need to know about the Thunderbolts when the beloved Winter Soldier is the most table among them,\" Feige teased. Brie Larson, Iman Vellani and Teyonah Parris closed out the panel with footage from the upcoming film. Miss Marvel, Captain Monica Rambeau and Captain Marvel find their powers have become intertwined and the three heroes must become untangled. In the mean time, the three continue to accidentally swap places, leading to quite a few laughs. The footage shown at the D23 Expo was action-packed and filled with comedic beats. Also, everyone's favorite Flerkin, Goose, will be back for more antics."},

The league will introduce clocks that limit time between batters and between pitches, limit defensive shifts and increase the size of bases in next year's season. The announcement came after reports that the league has struggled to bring in attendance above pre-pandemic levels. MLB is also seeking to expand its audience through streaming, such as with its deal with Apple TV+. Rule changes in recent years have been similarly crafted to increase game intrigue, like starting every extra inning with a man on base. The new rules include a 30-second timer to speed up time between batters. Pitchers will have 15 seconds between pitches when the bases are empty, but, with runners on base, that time will expand to 20 seconds. If a pitcher violates the timer, he will be charged an automatic ball. If a batter violates the limit, he will be charged an automatic strike. The defensive shift rule change is an attempt to increase batting average on balls put in play, particularly from batters who tend to hit mainly to one side of the field. The rule keeps the four infielders within the infield, and prevents them from switching sides. The limit should allow for more offensive action and force defenses to make more athletic plays. MLB is also increasing the size of bases from 15 inches square to 18 inches square. This gives infielders more distance between themselves and baserunners, in a bid to decrease collisions. The change also decreases base-to-base distance by 4.5 inches."},
{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/09/housing-market-confusion-whats-happening-next.html", "title": "Confused about the housing market? Here's what's happening now \u2013 and what could happen next", "paragraphs": " The slowdown in the otherwise red-hot housing boom has been stunningly swift. The U.S. housing market surged during the pandemic as homebound people sought new places to live, boosted by record-low interest rates. Now, real estate agents who once reported lines of buyers outside open houses and bidding wars on the back deck say homes are sitting longer and sellers are being forced to lower their sights. That has both potential buyers and sellers wondering where they stand. \"As recession concerns weigh on consumer outlooks, our survey shows uncertainty has made its way into the minds of many buyers,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. Here are the major factors behind the topsy-turvy housing market. The main driver of the slowdown is rising mortgage rates. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage, which is by far the most popular product today, accounting for more than 90% of all mortgage applications, started this year right around 3%. It is now just above 6%, according to Mortgage News Daily. That means a person buying a $400,000 home would have a monthly payment about $700 higher now than it would have been in January. The other drivers of the slowdown are high prices and low supply. Prices are now 43% higher than they were at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to the S&P Case-Shiller national home price index. The supply of homes for sale is growing, up 27% at the start of September compared with the same time a year ago, according to Realtor.com. While that comparison seems large, it's still not enough to offset the years-long shortage of homes for sale. Active inventory is still 43% lower than it was in 2019. New listings were also down 6% at the end of September, meaning potential sellers are now concerned as they see more houses sit on the market longer. Paul Legere is a buyer's agent with Joel Nelson Group in Washington, D.C. He focuses on the competitive Capitol Hill neighborhood, and he said he saw listings jump by 20 to 171 just after Labor Day. He now calls the market \"bloated.\" As a comparison, just 65 homes were listed for sale in March. \"This is a very traditional post Labor Day inventory bump and seeing in a week or so how the market absorbs the new inventory is going to be very telling,\" he said. \"Very.\" Inventory is taking a hit nationally because homebuilders are slowing production due to fewer potential buyers touring their models. Housing starts for single-family homes dropped 18.5% in July compared with July 2021, according to the U.S. Census. Homebuilder sentiment in the single-family market fell into negative territory in August for the first time since a brief dip at the start of the pandemic, according to the National Association of Home Builders. Builders reported lower sales and weaker buyer traffic. \"Tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve and persistently elevated construction costs have brought on a housing recession,\" said NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz in the August report. Buyers, however, have not disappeared entirely, despite the still-pricey for-sale market and the equally expensive rental market. \"Data indicates that some home shoppers are finding silver linings in the form of cooling competition for rising numbers of for-sale home option,\" said Realtor.com's Hale. \"Especially for buyers who are getting creative, such as by exploring smaller markets, this fall could bring relatively better chances to find a home within budget.\" Home prices are finally starting to cool off. They declined 0.77% from June to July, the first monthly fall in nearly three years, according to Black Knight, a mortgage technology and data provider. While the drop may seem small, it is the largest single-month decline in prices since January 2011. It is also the second-worst July performance dating back to 1991, behind the 0.9% decline in July 2010, during the Great Recession. Still, that drop in prices will do very little to improve the affordability crisis brought on by rising mortgage rates. While rates fell back slightly in August, they have risen sharply again this week, making for the least affordable week in housing in 35 years. It currently takes 35.51% of median income to make the monthly principal and interest payment on the median home with a 30-year mortgage and 20% down. That's up marginally from the prior 35-year high back in June, when the payment-to-income ratio reached 35.49%, according to Andy Walden, vice president of enterprise research and strategy at Black Knight. In the five years before interest rates began to rise, that income-to-payment ratio held steady around 20%. Even though home prices surged in the 2020 and 2021, record-low interest rates offset the increases. \"Given the large role affordability challenges appear to be playing in shifting housing market dynamics, the recent pullback in home prices is likely to continue,\" Walden said. A new report from real estate brokerage Redfin showed that while homebuyer demand woke up a bit in August, the latest increase in mortgage rates over the past week put it right back to sleep. Fewer people searched for \"homes for sale\" on Google with searches during the week ending Sept. 3 \u2013 down 25% from a year earlier, according to the report. Redfin's demand index, which measures requests for home tours and other home-buying services from Redfin agents, showed that during the seven days ending Sept. 4, demand was up 18% from the 2022 low in June, but still down 11% year over year. \"The housing market always cools down this time of year,\" said Daryl Fairweather, Redfin's chief economist, \"but this year I expect fall and winter to be especially frigid as sales dry up more than usual.\""},

Revenue is growing for Disney's parks, experiences and products division and the company is seeing steady increases in attendance, occupied room nights and cruise ship sailings. During its most recent earnings, Disney touted that its new Genie+ and Lightning Lane products helped boost average per capita ticket revenue during the quarter. These new digital features were introduced to curate guest experience and allow parkgoers to bypass lines for major attractions. The company said it has been able to bring back in-park experiences such as character meet-and-greets, theatrical performances and nighttime events at Disneyland, which has allowed it to increase capacity at its parks, CEO Bob Chapek said at the time. Disney has placed caps on attendance since it reopened after the initial round of pandemic closures in early 2020 and instituted a new online reservation system to control crowds. The company continues to add new features and attractions to its theme parks and cruise lines, which Josh D'Amaro, head of Disney's parks, experiences and product division, outlined Sunday at its D23 Expo. D'Amaro welcomed Jon Favreau, executive producer of \"The Mandalorian,\" on stage to announce that the Mandalorian will appear with an animatronic Grogu in Galaxy's Edge as part of its in-land costumed characters available for meet-and-greets and interactions. He will arrive in November. Disney CEO Bob Chapek revealed on Friday that the California-based Disneyland would be getting a third attraction at its Avengers Campus. The ride is based on the multiverse and riders will battle against villains from different universes, including King Thanos. Head of Marvel Studios Kevin Feige appeared in person while Mark Ruffalo, who portrays the Hulk, appeared via video to reveal that Hulk will be in the park as a meet-and-greet opportunity. The version of Hulk was developed as part of Project Exo and will arrive in the park next week. Pacific Wharf at Disney California Adventure will be transformed into San Fransokyo from \"Big Hero Six,\" and including the chance to meet Baymax, the helpful health-care robot. Additionally, Paradise Pier Hotel is becoming Pixar Place Hotel. Downtown Disney will add several new restaurants including Porto's Bakery and Cafe and Din Tai Fung. Disneyland's Toon Town land will get a version of Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway attraction from Hollywood Studios in Orlando, Florida, as well as a number of cosmetic updates and a new play yard for kids. These updates are expected in 2023. Tiana's Bayou Adventure, which is replacing Splash Mountain, takes place directly after the events of \"The Princes and the Frog\" and follows Princess Tiana as she searches for a missing ingredient for a party celebrating Carnival. The ride is slated to reopen in late 2024. D'Amaro said that music will be a huge part of the ride and the cast from the movie will return to lend their voices to the attraction. Anika Noni Rose, the voice of Tiana, arrived on stage to sing \"I'm Almost There\" and \"Dig a Little Deeper\" from the 2009 animated film. D'Amaro announced that Disney is in the midst of creating a new night-time spectacular for Epcot to celebrate the company's 100th anniversary. Additionally, Journey of Water, inspired by \"Moana,\" which was announced back in 2019 will open in late 2023. Also coming to Epcot is Figment, the fan-favorite purple dragon, who will be returning to the park for meet-and-greets in the future. Additionally, next year the Hat Box Ghost will appear at the Haunted Mansion in Walt Disney World. D'Amaro showed footage of his test ride of Tron Light Cycle Run, noting that the ride is slated to open in spring 2023 at Magic Kingdom. Disney's sixth cruise ship is called \"Disney Treasure\" and celebrates Walt Disney's love of adventure. The grand hall is inspired by \"Aladdin\" and features a statue of Jasmine and Aladdin riding on the magic carpet. D'Amaro said the \"Disney Wonder\" will now travel to Australia and New Zealand starting Oct. 2023. The company is also opening a new island vacation spot located in the Bahamas called Lighthouse Point. D'Amaro said 90% of the power used at this location will be provided by solar power. Duffy and Friends, cute cuddly characters from Shanghai Disney Resort, will be getting their own stop-motion series on Disney+. D'Amaro also showed new images from the Zootopia land, which will feature a large animatronic of Officer Clawhauser. No date has been set for the land's official opening. Hong Kong Disneyland is getting a new Walt Disney statue, which is inspired by Walt watching his children ride on a merry-go-round and inspiring the launch of Disney's theme parks. The park's Frozen-themed land will open in the second half of 2023. In Paris, a new promenade will be added to attach its new Frozen-inspired land to the rest of the park and a \"Tangled\" themed attraction will be added to the new garden area. Tokyo Disney Resort is also in the midst of adding a new land to its park based on \"Frozen,\" \"Tangled\" and \"Peter Pan\" called Fantasy Springs. Space Mountain at Tokyo Disneyland will undergo a transformation in 2024 and have a new plaza that will be complete in 2027. At the end of the panel, D'Amaro discussed what he called \"blue sky\" projects that the Imagineering team is working on. There are projects that are still in early development and may ultimately not see the light of day. D'Amaro talked about the possibility of revamping Dino Land at Animal Kingdom in Orlando, Florida. Initial ideas for the space include the possibility of bringing \"Zootopia\" to the park, including its variety of districts and animal species, or even \"Moana.\" At Magic Kingdom, Disney is asking the question: \"What is behind Big Thunder Mountain?\" The company teased that an area based on \"Coco\" could be in that location or \"Encanto.\" Perhaps, both. D'Amaro even teased the possibility of also bringing to life an area of Magic Kingdom overrun by Disney villains. The crowd erupted with applause at this suggestion. For the most part, villains make their appearances during Disney's Halloween special events. \"We are never going to stop delighting you,\" he said."},

Both Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin are planning to attend the conference, Indonesian President Joko Widodo said in an interview with Bloomberg News. Xi has not left the country since January 2020, before the Covid-19 pandemic. Biden and Xi previously discussed meeting at the G-20 during their July 28 phone call, which took place amid heightened tensions over House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's trip to Taiwan.

But unions built the middle class.\" Later Monday, he was flying to Pittsburgh for the city's parade \u2014 returning to Pennsylvania for the third time in less than a week and just two days after his predecessor, Donald Trump, staged his own rally in the state. The unofficial start of fall, Labor Day also traditionally starts a political busy season where campaigns scramble to excite voters for Election Day on Nov. 8. That's when control of the House and Senate, as well some of the country's top governorships, will be decided. Trump spoke Saturday night in Wilkes-Barre, near Scranton, where Biden was born. The president made his own Wilkes-Barre trip last week to discuss increasing funding for police, decry GOP criticism of the FBI after the raid on Trump's Florida estate and to argue that new, bipartisan gun measures can help reduce violent crime. Two days after that, Biden went to Independence Hall in Philadelphia for a prime-time address denouncing the \"extremism\" of Trump's fiercest supporters. Trump has endorsed candidates in key races around the country and Biden is warning that some Republicans now believe so strongly in Trumpism that they are willing to undermine core American values to promote it. The president said Thursday that \"blind loyalty to a single leader, and a willingness to engage in political violence, is fatal to democracy.\" Trump responded during his Saturday rally that Biden is \"an enemy of the state.\" On Monday, Biden said \"I'm not talking about all Republicans\" but singled out those who have taken Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" campaign cry to dangerous or hateful lengths. He highlighted episodes like last year's mob attack on the U.S. Capitol. Biden told the Milwaukee rally that many in the GOP have \"chosen to go backwards, full of anger, violence, hate, division.\" \"But together we can, and we must, choose a different path forward,\" Biden said. \"A future of unity and hope. we're going to choose to build a better America.\" The crowd jeered as Biden chided Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin for voting against a Democratic-backed measure meant to lower prescription drug prices. The president also returned to another theme that was a centerpiece of his 2020 campaign, that labor unions boosted the middle class. Unions endorsements helped Biden overcome disastrous early finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire to win the Democratic primary, and eventually the White House. He has since continued to praise labor unions \u2014 even though many voters without college degrees remain among Trump's strongest bloc of supporters. Mary Kay Henry, president of the 2-million-member Service Employees International Union, called Biden's championing of unions heading into the midterms \"critical\" and said the labor movement must \"mobilize in battlegrounds across the country to ensure that working people turn out.\" \"We're really excited about the president speaking directly to workers about, if he had the opportunity, he'd join a union,\" Henry said. She added: \"This president has signaled which side he's on. And he's on the side of working people. And that matters hugely.\" Biden, meanwhile, has personal history with Pittsburgh's Labor Day parade, which is among the nation's largest. He attended the 2015 installment as vice president and returned in 2018. Both times, Biden, now 79, faced questions about whether he'd run for president in coming elections \u2014 which he opted against in 2016 before winning the White House in 2020. This year, the oldest president in U.S. history has faced speculation about if he'll seek a second term in 2024 \u2014 though he's insisted that's his intention, and the pressure has dissipated some in recent weeks after a string of policy and political successes for Biden and his party. Still, both perennial presidential battleground states Biden was visiting Monday may provide key measures of Democrats' strength before this November and 2024. With inflation still raging and the president's approval ratings remaining low, how much Biden can help his party in top races \u2014 and how much candidates want him to try \u2014 remains to be seen. That was on display in Wisconsin, where Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes is trying to unseat incumbent Sen. Johnson, but did not appear with him in Milwaukee. In the state's other top race, Tim Michels, a construction executive endorsed by Trump, is attempting to deny Democratic Gov. Tony Evers a second term. Evers also spoke at the labor event Biden addressed and briefly greeted the president in a backstage photo line. \"We have a president who understands the challenges facing working families,\" Evers told the crowd. He said that Biden \"hasn't forgotten that working families matter, not just on Labor Day, but every single day of the year.\" Pennsylvania voters are choosing a new governor, with state Attorney General John Shapiro facing another Trump-endorsed Republican, Doug Mastriano, and a new senator. That race is between Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and Trump-backed celebrity heart physician Mehmet Oz. Shapiro and Fetterman both planned to attend Monday's Pittsburgh parade. The Pennsylvania and Wisconsin races could decide which party controls the Senate next year, while the winner of each governorship may influence results in 2024\u2032s presidential election. The stakes are particularly high given that some Trump-aligned candidates have spread lies about widespread fraud that did not occur during the 2020 election \u2014 raising questions about what might happen if a candidate they don't support wins the next presidential contest. Vice President Kamala Harris paid tribute to organized labor in at breakfast meeting with the Greater Boston Labor Council, declaring \"When union wages go up, everybody's wages go up.\" \"When union workplaces are safer everyone is safer,\" Harris said. \"When unions are strong, America is strong.\""},

Griffin is barred for life from holding any federal or state office \u2014 including his current role as county commissioner, from which he will be ousted \"effective immediately,\" Judge Francis Mathew ruled. Griffin became \"constitutionally disqualified\" from those positions as of Jan. 6, 2021, the judge concluded. On that day, a violent mob of former President Donald Trump 's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, forcing lawmakers to flee their chambers and disrupting the transfer of power to President Joe Biden. Griffin was convicted in March on a misdemeanor charge of breaching restricted Capitol grounds. The riot and the planning and incitement that led up to it \"constituted an 'insurrection'\" under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, Mathew wrote in the ruling in New Mexico's 1st Judicial District Court. The ruling marked the first time that any court found that the Capitol riot met the definition of an insurrection, according to the nonprofit government watchdog group CREW, which represented the plaintiffs who filed the lawsuit to disqualify Griffin. \"This decision makes clear that any current or former public officials who took an oath to defend the U.S. Constitution and then participated in the January 6th insurrection can and will be removed and barred from government service for their actions,\" CREW President Noah Bookbinder said in a press release. Griffin told CNN later Tuesday that he had been ordered to clean out his desk. \"I'm shocked, just shocked,\" Griffin told CNN. \"I really did not feel like the state was going to move on me in such a way. I don't know where I go from here.\" Mathew's ruling also marks the first time since 1869 that a court has disqualified a public official under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, according to CREW. That section, known as the Disqualification Clause, bars any person from holding civil or military office at the federal or state level of the United States if they \"have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.\" Griffin did not enter the Capitol building itself or commit violence during the Jan. 6 riot, but he nevertheless engaged in it and his actions \"aided the insurrection,\" Mathew ruled. \"By joining the mob and trespassing on restricted Capitol grounds, Mr. Griffin contributed to delaying Congress' election-certification proceedings,\" the judge wrote. Griffin's presence \"contributed to law enforcement being overwhelmed,\" and he also \"incited, encouraged, and helped normalize the violence\" during the riot, Mathew ruled. In addition, the judge dismissed as \"meritless\" the arguments put forward by Griffin, who represented himself in the case. Griffin's attempts to \"sanitize his actions are without merit and contrary to the evidence produced by the Plaintiffs, bearing in mind that he produced no evidence himself in his own defense,\" Mathew wrote. His arguments in court were \"not credible and amounted to nothing more than attempting to put lipstick on a pig,\" the judge added. Griffin was arrested less than two weeks after the Capitol riot. He was convicted in March and sentenced on June 17 to two weeks' time served in jail, along with a $3,000 fine and community service. Griffin, a Republican and a vocal supporter of Trump, has echoed the former president's false claims that the 2020 election results were compromised by widespread fraud. He and the two other GOP members who make up the Otero County Commission refused to certify its most recent primary election results, reportedly citing conspiracy theories about Dominion voting machines.

Barr, who served under Trump, again criticized a judge's order authorizing a so-called special master to review the thousands of documents that the FBI seized last month in a raid of Trump's Florida home Mar-a-Lago. Barr said that two major issues in the case over these materials \u2014 many of which bore classification markings \u2014 are whether the DOJ can make a case to charge Trump, and whether it should. \"Will the government be able to make out a technical case, will they have evidence by which \u2014 that they could indict somebody on, including him?\" Barr said in a Fox News interview, his third appearance on the network in five days. \"That's the first question, and I think they're getting very close to that point, frankly,\" said Barr, who led the Justice Department from early 2019 until the final months of the Trump administration. \"But I think at the end of the day, there's another question, [which] is do you indict a former president? What will that do to the country, what kind of precedent will that set, will the people really understand that this is not, you know, failing to return a library book, that this was serious,\" Barr said. \"And so you have to worry about those things, and I hope that those kinds of factors will incline the administration not to indict him, because I don't want to see him indicted as a former president,\" Barr said. \"But I also think they'll be under a lot of pressure to indict him, because \u2014 one question is, look, if anyone else would have gotten indicted, why not indict him?\" he added. Barr also said he hopes the DOJ appeals the ruling from federal Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee. Cannon authorized the appointment of a special master to review seized materials for personal items and records that are protected by executive privilege. The ruling, which Trump's lawyers sought, temporarily blocks the DOJ from reviewing or using the materials it took from Mar-a-Lago in the Aug. 8 raid. \"The problem I have with the special master is what she's done on what's called executive privilege documents. And she didn't address the only question that's in dispute, which is, can the former president have standing to say that the investigators don't even get to look at the classified documents that he wrongfully had at Mar-a-Lago,\" he said. \"She dodges it, and then she says she's bringing in a special master to look at whether stuff is executive privilege or not. That's not what the dispute is,\" Barr said. \"I hope it's appealed.\" A day earlier on Fox, Barr called Cannon's ruling \"deeply flawed in a number of ways.\" But he said it doesn't change \"the fundamental dynamics of the case,\" which are that \"documents were taken, classified information was taken and not handled appropriately, and they are looking into and there is some evidence to suggest that they were deceived.\" Spokespeople for Trump and the DOJ did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment. In another Fox interview Friday, Barr said he doubted Trump's claims that the documents taken from Mar-a-Lago were declassified, calling it \"highly improbable.\" But if Trump indeed \"stood over scores of boxes, not really knowing what was in them and said, 'I hereby declassify everything in here,' that would be such an abuse and that shows such recklessness that it's almost worse than taking the documents,\" Barr said. After that appearance, Trump slammed Barr in two social media posts, calling him \"a weak and pathetic RINO\" who \"started off OK as A.G., but faded fast.\" Trump's posts attacked Barr for his handling of former special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian meddling in the 2016 election, saying the DOJ should have released the contents of a laptop containing damaging information on President Joe Biden 's son Hunter before the 2020 election. Trump also wrote that Barr \"never fought the way he should have for Election Integrity,\" an apparent reference to Barr's refusal to back Trump's false claims that his 2020 loss to Biden was rigged through widespread fraud. Barr said in his Tuesday appearance on Fox that to Trump, a RINO is \"anyone who disagrees with him that the election was stolen.\""},

The announcement came after weeks of mounting pressure from Oz's campaign, which has questioned whether Fetterman is using his recent stroke as an excuse to avoid a public faceoff. Fetterman \"is either healthy and he's dodging the debate because he does not want to answer for his radical left positions, or he's too sick to participate in the debate,\" Oz, a celebrity doctor endorsed by former President Donald Trump, said at a press conference Tuesday. In a statement Wednesday, Fetterman responded, \"We're absolutely going to debate Dr. Oz, and it was always our intent to do that.\" \"It has simply only ever been about addressing some of the lingering issues of my stroke, the auditory processing, and we're going to be able to work that out,\" Fetterman's statement said. The Democratic lieutenant governor added that the debate will be \"sometime in the middle to end of October \u2014 as each of the past two Pennsylvania Senate races have \u2014 on a major television station to reach voters across the Commonwealth.\" Details are still being finalized, Fetterman said. \"But let's be clear this has never really been about debates for Dr. Oz,\" he added. \"This whole thing has been about Dr. Oz and his team mocking me for having a stroke because they've got nothing else.\" Politico first reported on Fetterman's announcement in an interview earlier Wednesday. Fetterman's campaign last month had refused to participate in an early September debate against Oz, accusing the Republican's campaign of mocking his status as a stroke survivor and acting in bad faith after it released a statement offering to \"pay for any additional medical personnel he might need to have on standby.\" Fetterman said in a statement at the time that he was \"eager\" to debate Oz, adding, \"as I recover from this stroke and improve my auditory processing and speech, I look forward to continuing to meet with the people of Pennsylvania.\" Fetterman said he \" almost died\" after suffering a stroke in May, just days before he won the Democratic nomination to compete for the Pennsylvania Senate seat being vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. The key swing state's Senate seat offers a major pickup opportunity for both parties, as Democrats fight to hold their razor-thin Senate majority and Republicans push to wrest control of the chamber. The stroke kept Fetterman off the campaign trail for three months. But polls of the race show he has held a lead over Oz, who has been bludgeoned with attacks characterizing him as an elitist with a stronger connection to New Jersey than Pennsylvania. Fetterman last month held his first public rally since the stroke and has conducted just four interviews with media organizations, including Politico. The outlet reported that Fetterman \"sometimes missed words while speaking\" during the 17-minute videoconference, but \"spoke at a normal pace\" and discussed a range of issues. \"He did not request to see the questions beforehand,\" Politico reported."},

The attorney, Robert Costello, said Bannon will turn himself in to authorities at 9 a.m. Thursday. Asked for details about the criminal charges Bannon is expected to face, Costello told CNBC by email, \"The indictment is sealed.\" The Manhattan District Attorney's Office, which will prosecute the case, has been investigating Bannon for possible violations of New York state criminal laws in connection with more than $25 million in funds raised for an effort to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. Bannon was arrested in August 2020 on federal charges with three other men tied to that effort, which prosecutors said defrauded hundreds of thousands of donors. Federal prosecutors said at the time that Bannon received $1 million in funds from We Build the Wall and that to divert that money used a separate nonprofit he had already created to purportedly promote \"economic nationalism and American sovereignty.\" Bannon never went to trial in that federal case because he received a pardon from then-President Donald Trump right before Trump left office in January 2021. Presidential pardons do not protect people from prosecution on state charges. In a statement Tuesday to NBC News, Bannon said New York \"has now decided to pursue phony charges against me 60 days before the midterm election.\" \"This is nothing more than a partisan political weaponization of the criminal justice system,\" he said. \"I am proud to be a leading voice on protecting our borders and building a wall to keep our country safe from drugs and violent criminals,\" Bannon said in that statement. \"They are coming after all of us, not only President Trump and myself. I am never going to stop fighting. In fact, I have not yet begun to fight. They will have to kill me first.\" The New York case is the second pending criminal action Bannon faces. In July, he was convicted of two counts of contempt of Congress for refusing to testify before the select House committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot by Trump supporters."},
{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/06/unsealed-fbi-docs-reveal-a-flurry-of-calls-amid-burrs-stock-trades.html", "title": "Unsealed FBI docs reveal a flurry of calls and stock trades by Sen. Burr in early 2020", "paragraphs": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Newly unsealed FBI documents paint a vivid picture of the government's evidence in a 2020 insider trading investigation of North Carolina's senior senator, Republican Richard Burr. Burr was ultimately not charged with breaking any laws. But the newly released sworn affidavit of an FBI special agent shows that the Justice Department had probable cause to believe that Burr had committed insider trading and securities fraud. As chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Burr in February 2020 abruptly liquidated more than half of his and his wife's equity holdings at a time when U.S. markets and most Americans did not yet know how bad the coronavirus pandemic was going to be. Given his position, Burr had information about the virus' spread, and about America's meager preparation for a massive pandemic, that was not available to the public. The affidavit was submitted in support of a search warrant application to seize and search Burr's phone, one that the judge in the case later granted. It lays out a startling timeline of calls and texts between Burr, his wife Brooke Burr, her brother Gerald Fauth and Fauth's wife that took place on the same days that both the Fauths and the Burrs sold off hundreds of thousands of dollars of stock, right before the market plunged. A spokesperson in Burr's Senate office did not respond to a request for comment on the newly unsealed documents. From the start, Burr has insisted that the only information he relied upon in deciding to sell his stocks was publicly available, including reports by CNBC correspondents in Asia. Nonetheless, as chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Burr was given access to classified intelligence reports in January and early February that contained dire warnings about the coronavirus. On Jan. 31, Burr received nonpublic information from a source whose name is redacted in the FBI documents. That same day, Burr put in orders to sell nearly $110,000 in stock from his and his wife's brokerage accounts. On Feb. 12, Burr ordered the purchase of approximately $1.2 million of Treasury securities, using 76% of the total holdings in Burr and his wife's joint account. \"Investors often purchase U.S. Treasury funds to hedge against a potential market downturn,\" the FBI special agent, Brandon Merriman, notes. He also noted that the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high of 29,551.42 on Feb. 12. One day after Burr's big Treasury bill purchase, Burr and his wife unloaded equity shares worth approximately $1.1 million. That the Burrs sold stock was reported at the time, but the value of the sale was only reported within a range. Monday's filing was the first time the exact amounts had been made public. According to the FBI, \"As a result of Senator Burr's sales on February 13, 2020, his portfolio went from approximately 83% in equities to approximately 3% in equities.\" A week later, markets began a steep slide as investors panicked over the potential economic damage from the coronavirus. The other person in Burr's family who sold a lot of stock on Feb. 13, 2020 was Burr's brother-in-law, Gerald Fauth. According to the affidavit, records show that a series of sell orders were placed into an account belonging to Fauth's wife, Mary Fauth, just before noon on the 13th, amounting to around $159,100. Burr's attorney, Alice Fisher, told ProPublica in May of 2020 that Burr \"did not coordinate his decision to trade on Feb. 13 with Mr. Fauth.\" But the FBI evidence released on Monday shows that Burr's wife called her brother shortly after 11 a.m. ET on the 13th, and they spoke for two minutes. Twenty minutes after that, Burr also used his cellphone to call Fauth, according to records obtained by the Justice Department. Just two minutes after Fauth's conversation with his brother-law ended, Fauth called his investment manager and they talked for just shy of half an hour. In a later interview, the adviser appears to have told the FBI that Fauth sounded hurried and that he mentioned knowing a senator in Washington. According to the FBI, the Burrs' stock sell orders were put in between 11:38 and 11:49 a.m. Fauth's orders were put in between 11:55 a.m. and 11:58 a.m. While the FBI affidavit sheds light on many of the questions surrounding Burr's stock sales, it closely protects at least one relevant piece of information: what kind of nonpublic information Burr had about the coronavirus and where he got it. But there may be some clues: Specifically, the Justice Department mentions dozens of text messages that Burr exchanged with someone whose name is redacted, but who appears to be a potential source of nonpublic information. According to the FBI, between Jan. 31, 2020, and April 7, 2020, this person and Burr \"exchanged approximately 32 text messages, nearly all of which concerned, in one way or another, the COVID-19 pandemic.\" Nearly everything about the text messages is redacted, but later in the affidavit, the government writes, \"those text messages include those discussed above, and included ones regarding other issues, such as efforts to provide face masks to the public, the 'global outlook' regarding COVID-19, and a proposed 'national lockdown.'\" If Burr was receiving this information when it wasn't being publicly discussed, that could have strengthened the government's case against him. It's still unclear why the Justice Department decided not to prosecute Burr or Fauth, and the department does not typically explain the reasons why it does not prosecute someone. But on Jan. 19, 2021, nearly a year after the questionable trades, Burr said in a statement, \"Tonight, the Department of Justice informed me that it has concluded its review of my personal financial transactions conducted early last year. \"The case is now closed. I'm glad to hear it,\" Burr said. \"My focus has been and will continue to be working for the people of North Carolina during this difficult time for our nation.\""},

During an online address to the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Russia, Modi spoke of a \"special partnership\" between the two countries and expressed particular interest in bolstering their cooperation on energy and coking coal. The Indian leader also pointed to the impact of Covid-19 and the Russian-Ukraine war on global supply chains, and called for \"diplomacy and dialogue\" in ending the conflict. \"In today's globalized world, events in one part of the world create an impact on the entire world,\" said Modi, in a translation first reported by the Hindustan Times. \"The Ukraine conflict and the Covid pandemic have had a major impact on global supply chains. Food grain, fertilizer, and fuel shortages are a matter of great concern for developing countries,\" he continued. \"From the very beginning of the Ukraine conflict, we have emphasized the need to adopt the path of diplomacy and dialogue. We support all peaceful efforts to end this conflict,\" Modi added. The comments come as Western allies are seeking to step up their economic squeeze on Russia. Last Friday, the G-7 announced plans to impose a cap on the price of Russian oil in a bid to curtail the Kremlin's ability to fund its onslaught in Ukraine. However, to be successful, members said the initiative would require buy-in from the broader international community \u2014 specifically major economies such as India and China. Until now, India, which has upped its purchases of Russian oil following the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine, has refused to be held on the issue. Speaking to CNBC Monday, India's Petroleum Minister Shri Hardeep Singh Puri said the country would consider the proposals \"very carefully,\" but added that he felt no moral obligation to sign up. \"No, there's no conflict. I have a moral duty to my consumer. Do I as a democratically elected government want a situation where the petrol pump runs dry?,\" Puri told CNBC's Hadley Gamble at Gastech 2022 in Milan, Italy. As of the end of March, Russia accounted for just 0.2% of India's oil imports, according to Puri, with the vast majority of the country's oil consumption \u2014 5 million barrels per day \u2014 coming from Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. Still, Modi in his speech Wednesday heralded the growing economic links between India and Russia. Specifically, he praised the 2019 launch of the \"Act Far-East\" policy, which saw India extend a $1 billion line of credit to the resource-rich region for developments in energy, diamonds and pharmaceuticals. \"This policy has become a major pillar of the special and privileged strategic partnership between India and Russia,\" he said."},

She was 96. The palace said the King and the Queen Consort \u2014 Prince Charles, the Duke of Cornwall, and his wife, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall \u2014 will remain at Balmoral Castle, the queen's royal residence in Scotland, on Thursday evening and will return to London on Friday. Immediate family members have been informed and traveled to Balmoral. \"Following further evaluation this morning, The Queen's doctors are concerned for Her Majesty's health and have recommended she remain under medical supervision,\" Buckingham Palace had said in a statement earlier in the day. The queen's other three children, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, as well as her grandson Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, were also at the palace. Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, was on his way. His wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, is not traveling with him but potentially could join Harry in Scotland at a later date, according to a spokesperson. Princess Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, has remained in Windsor as Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis are on their first full day at their new school, Kensington Palace said. The queen, who was Britain's longest-reigning monarch, had reportedly been suffering from deteriorating health for the past several months, with doctors citing ongoing \"episodic mobility problems.\" She spent a night in the hospital last October and had been forced to cut back on her public engagements since then. She had been on vacation at her Scottish estate since late July. On Tuesday, the queen broke with tradition and appointed her 15th prime minister from Balmoral rather than traveling to Buckingham Palace, as is typical. She was also forced to cancel a planned virtual meeting with senior ministers after being advised to rest by her doctors. Britain's new prime minister, Liz Truss, who met with the queen Tuesday, said her thoughts were with her and her family. \"My thoughts \u2014 and the thoughts of people across our United Kingdom \u2014 are with Her Majesty The Queen and her family at this time,\" she said earlier Thursday. Keir Starmer, leader of Britain's opposition Labour Party, said he was deeply concerned about the news of the queen's health. \"Along with the rest of the country, I am deeply worried by the news from Buckingham Palace this afternoon,\" he said earlier Thursday in a statement. Earlier in the day, Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said she was \"profoundly concerned\" and Wales' first minister, Mark Drakeford, sent his best wishes on behalf of the people of Wales. The news of the queen's ill health came as members of Parliament were gathered in the House of Commons to hear details of the government's plan to help households and businesses with rising energy costs. Cabinet minister Nadhim Zahawi was seen entering the chamber during the meeting and speaking urgently to Truss. Notes about the developing situation were also passed to the Commons speaker and the Labour leader. Elizabeth had been queen of Britain and more than a dozen other countries since 1952, when she acceded to the throne at aged 25. Her reign saw 15 prime ministers, from Sir Winston Churchill to Liz Truss, and 14 U.S. presidents. Earlier this year, she marked her 70th year on the throne with a series of Platinum Jubilee celebrations spanning four days. The queen only traveled to Buckingham Palace twice during that time, first for her Trooping the Colour balcony appearance and then for a finale after the pageant. Her husband Philip, the longest-serving royal consort in history, died last year at aged 99."},

Many of the investments the party has touted are in key battleground states. In Arizona, Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly \u2014 whose reelection bid will help to determine Senate control \u2014 joined AT&T CEO John Stankey and Corning CEO Wendell Weeks last week to announce a new fiber optic plant outside of Phoenix that will create hundreds of jobs. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen toured Ford's electric vehicle plant in Michigan on Thursday and discussed the benefits of clean energy. Later this month, she'll travel to North Carolina, where Toyota is spending $2.5 billion to manufacture EV batteries. North Carolina will also host a critical Senate race in November. Perhaps most significantly, President Joe Biden will attend the groundbreaking of Intel 's new semiconductor facility in the swing state of Ohio on Friday \u2013 the start of an investment that could be worth up to $100 billion. Both company executives and lawmakers claim the project was made possible by legislation spearheaded by Democrats. \"When you pass good legislation, you get good results,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said this week as he ticked off a laundry list of business investments. \"It's been a long time since the American people felt that Washington is capable of doing big things to meet big challenges.\" That tone represents a shift in the rhetoric that Democrats espoused a year ago. Back then, they were focused on raising revenue from corporations and the wealthy to pay for a sweeping social spending proposal known as Build Back Better: increasing the corporate tax rate, crafting a minimum global tax on multinational businesses and imposing new taxes on millionaires and billionaires, among others. And when inflation spiked to 40-year highs, some Democrats pinned the blame on corporate profiteering. But those proposals were blocked by the party's moderates. Though most of the attention was focused on Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, centrists in the House such as Reps. Stephanie Murphy of Florida and Kurt Schrader of Oregon also expressed discomfort. And as Democrats pared back their proposals, their message became more muted as well. \"It feels like a split screen sometimes,\" said Jim Kessler, executive vice president of policy at the moderate think tank Third Way. \"But there's a real opening here for Democrats on the economy and on its relationship with business.\" Now, Democrats are framing the latest investment announcements as evidence of their success on three other bills: the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act and the Chips and Science Act \u2013 both of which required Republican support \u2013 and the Inflation Reduction Act, which Democrats passed on their own. Shaking hands with business leaders could help counter Biden's low poll numbers. A majority of voters disapprove of his handling of the economy, including 57 percent of independents, according to an August poll by NBC News. The efforts to tout business investment come as inflation has also provided Republicans with a powerful line of attack. The National Republican Senatorial Committee circulated a Gallup poll this week that showed 74% of low-income Americans had suffered financial hardship because of rising prices, up from 66% in January. \"The Democrats' recent policies \u2026 hurt middle-class families around the country and have caused a recession whether they want to admit it or not,\" an NRSC spokeswoman said. \"Democrats seem to be oblivious about solving inflation, continuing to hurt our economy, and need to be voted out in November.\" Democrats haven't dropped their talking points on making corporations pay their fair share of taxes or holding big business accountable. The Inflation Reduction Act imposed a new tax on stock buybacks and set a domestic minimum tax of 15 percent, though manufacturers won a key carveout from that provision. It also will give Medicare the authority to negotiate prescription drug prices, despite heated opposition from the pharmaceutical industry. But for now, Democrats are highlighting their alliances with businesses rather than their arguments. And even the left wing of the party is acknowledging that there could be political and economic benefits to working alongside the business community. \"I think there's an understanding among progressive thinkers in the economy that we can't just focus on redistribution. We can't just focus on taxes and transfers,\" said Lindsey Owens, executive director of Groundwork Collaborative. \"We also have to focus on pre-distribution. We also have to make the market into what we want it to be.\" "},

Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg Jr. said that Bannon \"acted as the architect of a multi-million dollar scheme to defraud thousands of donors across the country \u2014 including hundreds of Manhattan residents.\" Bragg said that Bannon, \"We Build the Wall\" Chief Executive Officer Brian Kolfage and others involved in that campaign had repeatedly claimed that Kolfage would not be paid \"a penny\" for his work. \"But instead of pennies, [Kolfage] received more than $250,000 in a salary fund by donations,\" Bragg said. \"At least $140,000 of which, we allege, was laundered by Stephen Bannon,\" said Bragg, who spoke several hours after Bannon surrendered at Manhattan Criminal Court to face a grand jury indictment, which also charged WeBuildtheWall Inc. The district attorney said that Bannon throughout 2019 directed the We Build the Wall campaign to pay a non-profit that Bannon controlled \"tens of thousands of dollars at a time.\" \"Bannon's not-for-profit then paid a salary to [Kolfage], thereby obscuring the source of the funds, in direct contradiction to the many promises made by Bannon, We Build the Wall, and other associates in this scheme,\" Bragg said. A handcuffed Bannon, 68, appeared later Thursday in court for arraignment on six criminal counts, which include money laundering, conspiracy and scheme to defraud. He pleaded not guilty through his lawyer, David Schoen. A prosecutor asked Judge Juan Merchan to order Bannon, as a condition of his release on bail to immediately surrender any passports and to not apply for any new passports during the case. \"He's not going anywhere,\" Schoen said as he agreed to those conditions, which were imposed by the judge. \"He intends to fight these charges all the way,\" the lawyer said. Merchan ordered Bannon to return to court on Oct. 3 for a status hearing, and said he expected Bannon to appear as well for all subsequent proceedings. Bannon faces a potential maximum sentence of five to 15 years in prison if convicted of money laundering, the most serious charge in the indictment. He faces two counts of that charge. The new indictment comes more than two years after Bannon was arrested on federal charges that he and three other men defrauded donors who gave $25 million or more to fund the We Build the Wall campaign. That campaign supported the intention of then-President Donald Trump to build a wall along the southern border of the United States. Trump pardoned Bannon in that federal case on his last night before leaving office in January 2021. Presidential pardons only apply to federal crimes, and do not protect people from prosecution on state charges like the ones Bannon now faces in Manhattan. Kolfage and another man, Andrew Badolato, pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the wall scheme in April. They are scheduled to be sentenced in December. The federal trial of a third defendant in that case, Timothy Shea, ended with a deadlocked jury in June. Shea is scheduled to be retried next month. None of the three men in that federal case were charged in Thursday's indictment against Bannon. New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office participated in the investigation, said, \"There cannot be one set of rules for everyday people and another for the wealthy and powerful \u2013 we all must play by the same rules and must obey the law.\" \"Mr. Bannon took advantage of his donors' political views to secure millions of dollars which he then misappropriated. Mr. Bannon lied to his donors to enrich himself and his friends,\" James said. As he walked into Manhattan Criminal Court on Thursday morning, Bannon told a crowd of reporters and gawkers that the new prosecution against him is politically motivated. \"This is an irony, on the very day the mayor of this city has a delegation down on the border, they're persecuting people here,\" Bannon shouted over numerous hecklers jeering him. He was referring to New York City Mayor Eric Adams having dispatched a group of officials to the southern border earlier this week to meet with Border Patrol agents. That trip was part of an ongoing feud the Democrat Adams has with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, who has sent buses filled with migrants to New York City. One onlooker yelled at Bannon: \"Stop hurting America, you greasy, two-bit grifter!\" Bannon in July was convicted in U.S. District Court of Washington, D.C., of two counts of contempt of Congress. That case stemmed from his refusal to testify before the select House committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot by Trump supporters. \"We expect that case to be turned over on appeal,\" Schoen said Thursday during Bannon's arraignment in New York. Earlier this week, Bannon told NBC News that New York authorities \"decided to pursue phony charges against me 60 days before the midterm election.\" \"This is nothing more than a partisan political weaponization of the criminal justice system,\" he said."},

ABC, which first reported the subpoenas, noted that Trump and his allies \"have consistently pushed supporters to donate to the PAC, often using false claims about the 2020 election and soliciting donations to rebuke the multiple investigations into the former president, his business dealings, and his actions on Jan. 6.\" Trump's spokesman Taylor Budowich, in a tweet referring to the probe, wrote: \"It should surprise no one that days after [President Joe] Biden declared Trump supporters a 'threat' to democracy, his admin goes after those very same supporters & Save America PAC, which is committed to Make America Great Again.\" \"Biden is using government to divide & destroy this nation,\" Budowich wrote. Trump currently faces two pressing criminal investigations. One, being conducted by a state prosecutor in Georgia, is related to his and others' efforts to reverse the outcome of the 2020 presidential election in that state, which Biden won. The other is related to the removal of government documents from the White House to Trump's residence at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, when he left office in January 2021. The FBI last month raided Mar-a-Lago and seized thousands of such documents, including ones that were highly classified. Trump has denied any wrongdoing."},

The Justice Department also asked Judge Aileen Cannon to pause her related order blocking the government from further reviewing documents marked classified that were found during last month's search of Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Palm Beach resort home. The moves came three days after Cannon approved Trump's request for a special master to sift through the seized materials to identify personal items and records that are protected by attorney-client privilege or executive privilege. The DOJ had opposed that request, saying a team of agency officials had already completed a privilege review of the documents, and that a special master could harm the government's national security interests. In another court filing Thursday, the DOJ asked Cannon to make public a notice on the status of that team's filter review process, which had been filed under seal on Aug. 30. The \"broad strokes\" of the filter notice have already been made public, since the government had described the review team's process during a court hearing last week, the DOJ said in that filing. But Trump's lawyers object to the filter notice being unsealed, even though they have offered no redactions to the document and have not identified \"any basis for asserting privilege,\" the DOJ said. The FBI seized more than 10,000 government records when it raided Mar-a-Lago on Aug. 8. Many of those documents bore classification markings, including dozens of folders that were empty when they were collected by the FBI. Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, wrote in her ruling Monday in U.S. District in Southern Florida that \"the country is served best by an orderly process that promotes the interest and perception of fairness.\" The DOJ's appeal was filed at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, which holds appellate jurisdiction over cases from district courts in Florida. The Justice Department also asked Cannon to stay her order that blocks the agency from further reviewing and using the seized documents with classification markings for criminal investigative purposes, pending the appeal. Last week, the department revealed that the FBI seized more than 100 classified documents during the raid. The DOJ said in Thursday's filing that it is likely to succeed on its appeal as it applies to the classified records, which represent a fraction of the documents that were found at Mar-a-Lago. Trump \"does not and could not assert that he owns or has any possessory interest in classified records; that he has any right to have those government records returned to him; or that he can advance any plausible claims of attorney-client privilege as to such records that would bar the government from reviewing or using them,\" the DOJ wrote."},

Yellen, who spoke following a tour of the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, touted the Democrat-led Inflation Reduction Act, the bipartisan infrastructure law and the CHIPS and Science Act as boons to the manufacturing sector and job growth. Her speech came as Democrats aim to highlight their economic successes ahead of the midterm elections in November, which will determine whether Republicans can retake one or both chambers of Congress. President Joe Biden will travel to Ohio on Friday to promote the opening of an Intel semiconductor manufacturing facility. Many of the administration's policies conform to Yellen's so-called Modern Supply Side Economics framework. Before the pandemic, she said, higher inequality was accompanied by slower economic growth. \"And now with an economy at full employment, we are uniquely suited for a supply-side expansion that delivers sustainable growth and reduces inequality,\" Yellen said. She also noted the Biden administration's stabilization efforts \"will put the United States back to full employment in record time\" after the pandemic, declining labor force participation and the war in Ukraine weighed down the U.S. economy. \"Taken together, the bipartisan infrastructure law, the CHIPS Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act authorized among the most significant investments our country has ever made,\" Yellen said. \"I believe firmly, they will help us achieve stable sustainable growth, and they'll move us toward a fairer and more resilient economy.\" Yellen attributed an economic turnaround during the pandemic to one of President Joe Biden's political priorities upon entering the White House. \"Due to the American Rescue Plan and our vaccination campaign, the United States experienced the fastest pace of job creation in our history,\" she said. \"Household balance sheets are strong, and businesses continue to invest.\" Biden signed the $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package into law in March 2021, authorizing payments of up to $1,400 for most Americans, extending $300 per week in unemployment insurance and expanding the child tax credit. The package also included $20 billion for Covid-19 vaccinations and millions in rental assistance. The unemployment rate returned to its pre-pandemic level in July and tied for the lowest level since 1969 for every demographic group but African Americans, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. During her visit, the Treasury secretary also visited small businesses that are recipients of Detroit's Motor City Match grant program. Expansion of that program was made possible with $15 million in American Rescue Plan funding. Republicans have hammered Democrats for passing the legislation, saying the massive injection of government aid helped to fuel inflation. The $80 billion allotted to the IRS under the Inflation Reduction Act to enforce compliance of a 15% minimum tax on large corporations will help correct a two-tiered tax system \"by ensuring that large corporations and high-income earners cannot avoid paying the taxes they owe,\" Yellen said. The tax cap \u2014 the amount of money owed but unpaid to the IRS \u2014 will add up to $7 trillion over the next decade and is \"disproportionately concentrated among higher earners,\" she said. The resources from the IRA \"will enable the IRS to increase audits of taxpayers at the high end and collect taxes from those who have not paid their full bill,\" Yellen said. The GOP also has targeted the tax increases included as part of the bill, which Democrats aim to use to pay for massive investments in mitigating climate change. The CHIPS Act, a Biden-backed bipartisan law that makes a historic investment in domestic semiconductor manufacturing, will enable the U.S. to compete economically with China and other nations that have historically invested more in research and development, Yellen said. \"The United States now ranks 10th in the world in terms of R&D investments as a share of output,\" she said. \"The estimated cost [of] the retreat in public R&D is $200 billion per year in lost economic output. And meanwhile, competitors in China and the rest of the world are marching forward.\" Approximately $40 billion in incentives injected into the chip manufacturing sector will decrease foreign reliance on the technology necessary to make cars and other goods, Yellen said. Yellen said the modern supply-side policies promoted by the Commerce Department and the White House are pro-growth as well as pro-fairness. The wealthiest Americans and large corporations benefited the most from tax incentives from past administrations, she said. But the Biden administration has focused on investing in disadvantaged communities. \"In layman's terms, this approach embraces the notion that some of the best opportunities for growth occur when we invest in people in places that have been forgotten and overlooked,\" Yellen said. The Treasury secretary said the Commerce Department will establish at least 20 technology and innovation hubs \"geographically dispersed with priority for underserved and underrepresented communities.\" \"Such dispersal of economic opportunity across the country will mean good new jobs and industries,\" Yellen said."},

She was 96. The queen died \"peacefully\" at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, the British royal family said. Under a long-standing plan known as \"Operation London Bridge,\" her death ushers in 10 days of national mourning. Her son Charles became king upon her death, and will be called King Charles III. With husband Prince Philip by her side, Elizabeth became queen of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand upon the death of her father, George VI, on Feb. 6, 1952. Her coronation was June 2, 1953. On Feb. 6, 2022, Elizabeth became the first British monarch to reign 70 years. In honor of the occasion, the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth held a Platinum Jubilee in June 2022. The 96-year-old monarch made an appearance with her family on the balcony of Buckingham Palace during the first day of the four-day-long Platinum Jubilee, waving to tens of thousands of people gathered below and watching an aviation display in her honor. But she was unable to attend events later on during the celebrations due to discomfort. Elizabeth's reign covered a period of massive social, economic, technological and political change. It saw the transformation of the once-global British Empire into a Commonwealth of 52 independent nations headed by the queen, and the country's entrance into and exit from the European Union. Fifteen prime ministers served under Elizabeth \u2014 from Winston Churchill on her accession to the throne in 1952 to Liz Truss, who was sworn in by the frail queen only two days before the monarch's death was announced. She also presided over a family that saw tragedy, scandal and turmoil, including the death of former Princess Diana, the association of son Prince Andrew with the late millionaire sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein, and the decision by grandson Prince Harry to seek a more private life with his wife, the former Meghan Markle. Born April 21, 1926, Elizabeth was the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York, who became King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1937 following the abdication of Edward VIII. She was the 32nd great-granddaughter of King Alfred the Great, England's first monarch, who reigned from 871 to 899. \"Lilibet\" and her younger sister, Margaret, born in 1930, were educated at home by tutors, including a governess. Soon after the coronation of Elizabeth's father, the U.K. was plunged into World War II. At 14, she made her first radio broadcast in 1940, addressing children who had been evacuated to the countryside and abroad to avoid the bombings of British cities. \"We know, every one of us, that in the end, all will be well,\" she intoned in a delicate soprano to the BBC \"Children's Hour\" audience. \"For God will care for us and give us victory and peace. When peace comes, remember it will be for us, the children of today, to make the world of tomorrow a better and happier place.\" Later during the war, the teenage princess served as a driver for the Auxiliary Territorial Service. When VE Day arrived, she and Margaret sneaked out of Buckingham Palace to mingle with the crowds on the streets of London celebrating the Allied victory in Europe. \"I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief,\" she told a biographer. On Nov. 20, 2017, Elizabeth and Prince Philip celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary. Their 73\u00bd-year marriage was by far the longest for the monarchy, surpassing that of King George III and Queen Charlotte's 57 years (1761-1818). Princess Elizabeth met Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark in 1934 at the wedding of his first cousin, Princess Marina, to Prince George, Duke of Kent. Thirteen years later, Elizabeth and Philip married at Westminster Abbey in an uplifting ceremony \u2014 two years after the end of World War II. Hundreds of thousands of people lined the streets along the route from Buckingham Palace. \"For a brief moment the pace of the strident terrible twentieth century was slowed to the trot of cavalry horses and the rumbling of coaches and pageantry evoked bitter sweet memories of this island's old, heroic past,\" The New York Times' Drew Middleton wrote in a dispatch from London. Philip, the princess' third cousin, had served with the Royal Navy during World War II. His family name was changed to Mountbatten from Battenberg during World War I because of anti-German sentiment. The union was not without controversy. Philip was broke and foreign-born, but nonetheless they received 2,500 wedding gifts from around the world. A son and heir, Charles, was born in 1948, followed by Anne, Andrew and Edward. In 1952, Elizabeth and Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, began a tour of Australia and New Zealand by stopping in Africa. While they were in Kenya, the news reached them on Feb. 6 that King George had died. At age 25, Elizabeth ascended to the throne and was crowned the following year in the first live television coronation to be broadcast around the world. In May 2017, a month before Philip's 96th birthday, Buckingham Palace announced that the duke was retiring from his royal duties as of September. Philip died at age 99 on April 9, 2021, the 16th anniversary of the marriage of Prince Charles and Camilla, and the duke's funeral was four days before Elizabeth's 95th birthday on April 21. On what would have been his 100th birthday on June 20, the queen planted a specially bred rose named the Duke of Edinburgh in Windsor Castle's East Terrace Garden. During her time on the throne, Elizabeth took her place on the global stage along with elected leaders and dictators. Her long reign saw her circling the globe many times: Following her coronation, Elizabeth and Philip took a seven-month tour, visiting 13 countries and logging more than 40,000 miles. She had met with every U.S. president from Harry S. Truman to Joe Biden, except for Lyndon Johnson. She was entertained at the White House by five presidents \u2014 Dwight Eisenhower, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. She also met five popes, from Pius XII (in 1951 before she was queen) to Francis in 2014. In 2015, Elizabeth overtook her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria to become the oldest and longest-reigning British monarch. Upon the October 2016 death of Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej, ending his 70 years on the throne, she became the world's longest-reigning monarch and head of state. She celebrated six jubilees, her 25th, 40th, 50th, 60th, 65th and 70th years on the throne, as well as the marriages of her four children and the births of eight grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren. The storybook wedding of her son Charles to Lady Diana Spencer on July 29, 1981, was attended by 2,650 guests at St. Paul's Cathedral and witnessed by nearly a billion television viewers around the world. Elizabeth's reign was also marked by crisis, including two assassinations attempts, in 1970 and 1981 in Australia and New Zealand, respectively. In 1979, her art advisor, Anthony Blunt, was unmasked as a communist spy, and Prince Philip's uncle, Lord Mountbatten, was killed by an Irish Republican Army bomb. In 1969, the queen opened palace doors to television cameras for a candid look at the family in an attempt to humanize its members. The resulting documentary, \"Royal Family,\" was seen by millions of Britons on the BBC and ITV. Critics, however, claimed it debased the Windsors, and led to the frenzied celebrity coverage of members of \"The Firm,\" as the family is known. It has not been aired since 1972. In 1992, the marriages of three of her children collapsed. Andrew divorced Sarah Ferguson, Anne divorced Capt. Mark Phillips and Diana's tell-all book revealed Charles' affair with Camilla Parker-Bowles. Charles and Diana soon began a separation that ended in divorce four years later. During an October 1992 visit by the queen to Dresden, eastern Germany, whose inner city was largely destroyed by the 1945 British-American firestorm, she was pelted with eggs. Back home the next month, on the 45th anniversary of her marriage to Philip, fire heavily damaged Windsor Castle, one of her official residences. \"1992 is not a year on which I shall look back with undiluted pleasure,\" she said in the speech, 40 years after she ascended to the throne and four days after the Windsor fire. \"In the words of one of my more sympathetic correspondents, it has turned out to be an 'annus horribilis.' I suspect that I am not alone in thinking it so.\" The year 2002, wasn't so good, either. She lost her sister, Princess Margaret, in February, and her mother, Queen Elizabeth, the 101-year-old Queen Mother, seven weeks later. In spite of republican sentiments at home and in the Commonwealth and criticism of the royal family's lifestyle, Elizabeth seemingly managed to rise above the gossip and opprobrium, with her personal popularity generally remaining high. To be sure, she was vilified for remaining at Balmoral Castle in Scotland for five days after the death of Diana on Aug. 31, 1997. In the early morning hours, Buckingham Palace issued a brief statement saying the queen and Charles were \" deeply shocked and distressed by this terrible news.\" But to the dismay of much of the nation, the royal family hunkered down at Balmoral rather than to immediately return to London. Many of her subjects were aghast that Buckingham Palace didn't fly the flag at half staff. In fact, in accordance with protocol, no flag flew on the palace until she finally returned there on Sept. 4. The family later said they stayed at Balmoral to protect and prepare her grieving grandsons, Princes William and Harry, then 15 and 12, for their mother's funeral. Still, Elizabeth's silence was deafening. \"Your people are suffering ... SPEAK TO US MA'AM,\" screamed the headline on The Mirror tabloid on Sept. 4. A day later, on the eve of the funeral, the queen gave a live televised speech, lamenting \"from my heart\" the \"dreadful news\" about the Princess of Wales, and remembering her as an \"exceptional and gifted human being\" and devoted mother. \"No one who knew Diana will ever forget her,\" the queen continued. \"Millions of others who never met her, but felt they knew her, will remember her. I for one believe there are lessons to be drawn from her life and from the extraordinary and moving reaction to her death. I share in your determination to cherish her memory.\" A generation later, in a sign of just how far the monarchy itself had come during her reign, the niece of the king who abdicated his throne so that he could marry an American divorcee welcomed the November 2017 engagement and May 2018 marriage of Harry to Markle, a divorced biracial American actress. The queen expressed similar joy upon the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's son, Archie, on May 6, 2019. But nearly two years later, the House of Windsor was rocked by the self-exiled Sussexes' charges of racism and insensitivity to an outsider. In early 2020, Elizabeth convened an emergency meeting with Charles, William and Harry to discuss the latter's attempt to step back from royal duties and live part time abroad. In typically diplomatic language, the queen's post-meeting statement said: \"My family and I are entirely supportive of Harry and Meghan's desire to create a new life as a young family. Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working Members of the Royal Family, we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent life as a family while remaining a valued part of my family.\" A year later, Harry and Meghan confirmed their decision. \"While all are saddened by their decision, The Duke and Duchess remain much loved members of the family,\" the queen said in a statement. Then in March 2021, the Sussexes aired their charges of racism during an interview with Oprah Winfrey from their home in Santa Barbara, California. Meghan alleged that a member of \"The Firm\" had raised concerns during her pregnancy with Archie about how \"dark his skin might be when he's born.\" The couple didn't identify who had raised the issue, but said it wasn't Elizabeth or Philip. The Sussexes also said the family had withdrawn security protection for them, and Meghan said she had had \"clear and real and frightening thought\" about suicide. In a statement after the interview aired, the queen responded with concern and sensitivity: \"The whole family is saddened to learn the full extent of how challenging the last few years have been for Harry and Meghan. The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning, While some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately. Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved family members.\" Three months later, in June 2021, Meghan gave birth to the queen's 11th great-grandchild, Lilibet \"Lili\" Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, named after Harry's grandmother and mother. Around that time, Elizabeth was criticized after reports that she allowed Andrew to be interviewed in Buckingham Palace by the BBC in November 2019 about his relationship with Epstein. Days after the interview, Andrew announced that the queen \"has given her permission\" for him to \"step back from public duties for the foreseeable future.\" The announcement happened to come on the 72nd anniversary of the queen's marriage to Philip. An earlier example of how the queen's years of diplomacy and experience managed to win over people was demonstrated in the 2011 state visit to Ireland, a country that spent the first half of the 20th century fighting for independence from the U.K. and the second half involved in the Northern Ireland \"troubles\" that saw 3,600 people dead, including Philip's mentor, Lord Mountbatten. Her official visit to Ireland, the first by a British monarch in a century, came nearly 13 years after the Good Friday peace agreement. Addressing a dinner in her honor at Dublin Castle, Elizabeth helped the two countries put the previous decades of strife behind them by beginning her speech in Gaelic: \"A Uachtarain, agus a chairde\" \u2014 \"president and friends.\" \"It is a sad and regrettable reality that through history our islands have experienced more than their fair share of heartache, turbulence and loss. ... To all those who have suffered as a consequence of our troubled past I extend my sincere thoughts and deep sympathy,\" she continued. \"With the benefit of historical hindsight we can all see things which we would wish had been done differently or not at all. But it is also true that no one who looked to the future over the past centuries could have imagined the strength of the bonds that are now in place between the governments and the people of our two nations. So ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to rise and join me in a toast to the president and people of Ireland.\" Later during her reign, the world shut down as the coronavirus pandemic swept the globe. On an early April day in 2020, the queen appeared in a rare video speech from Windsor Castle to promise her subjects that they will prevail over the coronavirus. The speech aired hours before then Prime Minister Boris Johnson was hospitalized for Covid-19. \"While we have faced challenges before, this one is different,\" she said. \"This time we join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavor, using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal.\" During the pandemic, Elizabeth and Philip stayed at Windsor Castle, where she performed duties remotely and where the couple received their first vaccinations in January 2021. But Covid restrictions were still in place during Philip's funeral in April 2021. To comply with the stringent pandemic-era social distancing protocols in effect across the country, the queen sat alone in mourning, dressed in black instead of her usual bright colors. A day after Philip's death, daughter-in-law Sophie Countess of Wessex told well-wishers outside Windsor Castle that \"the queen has been amazing.\" On his casket, Elizabeth left a handwritten note signed \"Lilibet,\" and on her 95th birthday four days later, she issued a statement saying she had been \"deeply touched\" by her subjects' displays of \"support and kindness.\" In her televised speech on Palm Sunday 2020, the queen promised victory over Covid. \"We will succeed \u2014 and that success will belong to every one of us. We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: We will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again.\" \u2014 Phillip Tutt, formerly of CNBC.com, and Michele Luhn contributed to this story. Correction: The queen visited Dresden in eastern Germany in 1992. A previous version of this story misidentified the region."},

Shortly after 10 a.m. (0900 GMT), a hearse carrying Elizabeth's oak coffin emerged from the gates of Balmoral Castle, where she died on Thursday aged 96, at the start of a slow drive to the Scottish capital. The coffin was draped in the Royal Standard of Scotland with a wreath on top made of flowers taken from the Balmoral estate including sweet peas, one of Elizabeth's favorites. Crowds, fifteen deep in places, massed in the center of Edinburgh to greet the cortege, which included the queen's daughter, Princess Anne, as it made it way to the Palace of Holyroodhouse where it was met by a military guard of honor. Soldiers from the Royal Regiment of Scotland then carried the coffin to the throne room of the palace where it will remain overnight. \"There was no way I could miss this. I would regret it for the rest of my life,\" said Eilidh Mackintosh, 62, who left her home at 6 a.m. to be sure of a good view on Edinburgh's famous Royal Mile where large crowds were gathering. \"She never let us down and I didn't want to let her down either. Now she has gone there is a big hole in the heart of the nation.\" The journey from Balmoral was the first of a series of events leading up to the state funeral at Westminster Abbey in London on Sept. 19. In an emotional tribute to his mother on Friday, the new monarch, King Charles, said she had begun a \"last great journey\" to join Prince Philip, her husband of 73 years who died last year. Her death has drawn tears, sadness and warm tributes, not just from the queen's own close family and many in Britain, but also from around the globe \u2014 reflecting her presence on the world stage for seven decades. Wherever the cortege went as it wound its way through picturesque countryside, villages, small towns and cities, people lined the road or stopped their cars to get out and watch. At one point, it passed a guard of honor formed by dozens of tractors lined up in adjacent fields by farmers. Many watched silently in the bright sunshine. Some threw flowers into the road. For others, the emotion of the moment moved them to tears. \"It's just very, very sad. I'm happy I was here to say our goodbyes,\" said Elizabeth Alexander, 69, who was born on the day the queen was crowned in 1953. Many thousands are continuing to gather at other royal palaces across Britain, and large piles of flowers are massing as people visit to pay their respects. Charles became king immediately after his mother's death and was officially proclaimed the new monarch at a ceremony on Saturday, full of pageantry and centuries-old traditions. Similar proclamations are following across the United Kingdom and the other 14 realms of which Charles is now head of state, including Australia, Canada, Jamaica, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said parliament would be recalled on Thursday to allow members to pay tribute. The queen came to the throne following the death of her father King George VI on Feb. 6, 1952, when she was just 25. Her coronation took place a year later. While Elizabeth's death was not totally unexpected given her age and deteriorating health, there was still a sense of shock at the news. \"We all thought she was invincible,\" her grandson Prince William, now the heir to the throne, told a well-wisher on Saturday as he met crowds at Windsor castle. The day of Elizabeth's funeral will be a public holiday in Britain, officials have announced. U.S. President Joe Biden said he would be there, although full details of the event and the attendees have not yet been released. Before that, her coffin will be flown to London and there will be a somber procession when it is later moved from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Hall where it will lie in state for four days. \"It goes without saying that we can expect large numbers of people,\" a spokesperson for Prime Minister Liz Truss told reporters. Truss, whose appointment as prime minister on Tuesday was the queen's last public act, will join King Charles as both the new head of state and prime minister tour the four nations of the United Kingdom in the next few days. Charles, 73, is now the 41st monarch in a line that traces its origins to the Norman King William the Conqueror who captured the English throne in 1066. Elizabeth's death has capped a difficult couple of years for the royal family. The most high-profile issue has involved her grandson Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, who stepped down from royal life in 2020 to move to California, where they both have heavily criticized the institution. That has left them alienated from the rest of the family, with Harry and his older brother William said to be barely on speaking terms. But the death of their grandmother has seen differences put aside, as they appeared together with their wives outside Windsor Castle to meet the crowds on Saturday. A royal source described it as an important show of unity at an incredibly difficult time for the family."},

The death of 96-year-old Queen Elizabeth on Thursday after 70 years on the throne set in train long-established and highly choreographed plans for days of national mourning and a state funeral that will be held in just over a week. Charles, 73, succeeded his mother immediately on Thursday but an Accession Council met on Saturday to proclaim his succession, with his son and heir William, wife Camilla and Britain's new prime minister, Liz Truss, among those to sign the proclamation. Making his personal declaration, Charles said: \"In carrying out the heavy task that has been laid upon me, and to which I now dedicate what remains to me of my life, I pray for the guidance and help of Almighty God.\" The proclamation was also set to be read publicly in the other capital cities of the United Kingdom - Edinburgh in Scotland, Belfast in Northern Ireland, and Cardiff in Wales - and at other locations, too. The death of Elizabeth, Britain's longest-reigning monarch, has drawn an outpouring of tributes from at home and around the globe. Landmarks have been used to celebrate her life, with buildings in Europe, America and Africa lit up in the red, white and blue of the United Kingdom. In Britain, people started gathering outside royal palaces in the early hours of Saturday morning, with thousands flocking to Buckingham Palace to pay respects to the queen and Charles - who was proclaimed king at the nearby St James's Palace. \"It's a poignant time in our country's history,\" design manager Ian Bilboe, 54, said. \"(We're) here to be part of that and show respect to the late queen and also to the new king.\" Charles is king and head of state of the United Kingdom and 14 other realms including Australia, Canada, Jamaica, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. Britain has declared a period of mourning until the state funeral for Elizabeth, once described by her grandson Harry as \"the nation's grandmother\". The date for that has not been announced but it is expected in a little over a week's time. Leaders from around the world are expected in London for the funeral, including U.S. President Joe Biden, who said on Friday he would attend. Charles' coronation as king will take place at a later date - and the timing for that is not yet clear. There was a 16-month gap between Elizabeth becoming queen in 1952 and her coronation in 1953. The new king vowed on Friday to serve the nation with \"loyalty, respect and love\" in his first address to the nation as king. Earlier on Friday, returning to London from Scotland where his mother died, he was greeted with cheers, applause and a crowd singing \"God Save The King\" as he made his first public appearance outside Buckingham Palace. Charles also said in his address that he had made his eldest son William, 40, the new Prince of Wales, the title that had been his for more than 50 years and is traditionally held by the heir to the throne. William's wife Kate becomes Princess of Wales, a role last held by the late Princess Diana. Thousands have gathered since Thursday at royal palaces to pay their respects to the late queen, with some shedding tears as they laid flowers and others wanting to celebrate the life of a monarch who for most Britons was the only they have ever known. Elizabeth, who was the world's oldest and longest-serving head of state, came to the throne following the death of her father King George VI on Feb. 6, 1952, when she was just 25. Over the decades she witnessed a seismic change in the social, political and economic structure of her nation. She won praise for guiding the monarchy into the 21st Century and modernising it in the process, despite intense media scrutiny and the often highly public travails of her family. Charles, who opinion polls indicate is less popular than his mother, now has the task of securing the institution's future."},

In a searing order Thursday, Judge Donald Middlebrooks said that Trump's lawsuit was merely \"seeking to flaunt a two-hundred-page political manifesto outlining his grievances against those that have opposed him.\" The former president's claims \"are not only unsupported by any legal authority but plainly foreclosed by binding precedent,\" Middlebrooks wrote in U.S. District Court in southern Florida. Trump filed the lawsuit in March, seeking tens of millions of dollars in damages for violations of the RICO Act, a federal law that aims to combat organized crime, among other claims. It came more than five years after Trump defeated Clinton in a vicious and scandal-soaked presidential campaign where Trump's relationship with Russia was a major focus. The suit claims the defendants worked to produce false or misleading evidence of damaging ties between Trump's campaign and Russia. It names dozens of people and entities as defendants, including Clinton, the DNC, ex-Clinton aide John Podesta, the law firm Perkins Coie, research firm Fusion GPS, ex-Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook, and others. Trump claimed he has suffered at least $24 million in damages as a result of the defendants' actions. His lawsuit sought to recover triple the amount in damages. \"Many of the Amended Complaint's characterizations of events are implausible because they lack any specific allegations which might provide factual support for the conclusions reached,\" Middlebrooks wrote in Thursday's order. \"What the Amended Complaint lacks in substance and legal support it seeks to substitute with length, hyperbole, and the settling of scores and grievances,\" he wrote. The judge agreed with the defendants' characterization of Trump's lawsuit as \"a series of disconnected political disputes that Plaintiff has alchemized into a sweeping conspiracy among the many individuals Plaintiff believes to have aggrieved him.\" Trump's legal team \"will immediately move to appeal this decision,\" his attorney Alina Habba said in a statement Friday morning. Middlebrooks' order was \"rife with erroneous applications of the law\" and it ignored \"numerous governmental investigations which substantiate\" Trump's conspiracy claims, Habba's statement added. Former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of 2016 Russian election meddling concluded that the Kremlin did interfere in the contest but found insufficient evidence to prove collusion with Trump's campaign. Trump has repeatedly decried the Mueller probe as a witch hunt, one of many he claims have been launched against him since his foray into politics."},

The queen died \"peacefully\" at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, the British royal family said. She was last photographed on Tuesday during the appointment of Liz Truss as prime minister of the United Kingdom. Truss, former British prime ministers and other current and former world leaders who served during Elizabeth II's 70-year-reign, paid tribute to the queen, who was the world's second-longest reigning monarch of all time. Britain's King Charles III \"The death of my beloved Mother, Her Majesty The Queen, is a moment of the greatest sadness for me and all members of my family,\" Elizabeth's son and the new British king said in a statement. \"We mourn profoundly the passing of a cherished Sovereign and a much-loved Mother. I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the Realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world.\" U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss \"Queen Elizabeth II was the rock on which modern Britain was built,\" Truss said. \"Our country has grown and flourished under her reign.

An enduring admiration for Queen Elizabeth II united people across the Commonwealth. The seven decades of her history-making reign bore witness to an age of unprecedented human advancement and the forward march of human dignity.\" They continued: \"In the years ahead, we look forward to continuing a close friendship with The King and The Queen Consort.

He later continued: \"We will mourn her. We will miss her. But our overwhelming sentiment will be of gratitude, profound, heartfelt and sincere thanks for what she did, what she stood for, for the life she lived and for what she gave us, her grateful subjects.

In a new interview, Cobb also said Trump's conduct on Jan. 6, 2021, while a mob of his supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol, could \u2014 at least theoretically \u2014 lead to him being barred from seeking the presidency. \"There is a simple way to disqualify President Trump,\" Cobb told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett in an interview on \"The Takeout\" podcast. \"He clearly violated the 14th Amendment of the Constitution's Article III when he gave aid and comfort and three hours of inaction with regard to what was happening on the grounds of the Capitol,\" he said. \"That clearly gave aid and comfort to the insurrectionists,\" said Cobb, who added that a joint declaration by both chambers of Congress could on those grounds block Trump from being able to regain the White House. Spokesmen for Trump did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Cobb's remarks. A former federal prosecutor, Cobb from mid-2017 to mid-2018 managed the Trump White House's legal response to then-special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In the interview, Cobb blasted Trump for what he called \"the big lie\" in denying after the 2020 election that he had lost to Biden. He also criticized the former president for his pressure campaign on Pence to not certify slates of electors from individual states that gave Biden his margin of victory in the Electoral College. \"Interfering with Pence, saying Mike deserves this when people are shouting 'Kill Pence,' I think that's outrageous,\" Cobb said. \"I think interfering with what the vice president was obligated to do, trying to persuade him in a very aggressive effort not to certify the election, and to send certain electors back, I think that was criminal,\" he added. Cobb also said he believes the chances of Trump being indicted by the Department of Justice are \"very high.\" That statement came days after William Barr, who served as U.S. attorney general in the Trump administration, said he believes the DOJ is \"getting very close\" to having enough evidence to criminally charge Trump. The Justice Department is investigating Trump for the removal of thousands of government documents, some of them highly classified, from the White House when he left office in January 2021. Cobb said he suspects the FBI recovered documents that may be related to Trump's efforts to remain in office during its Aug. 8 raid on Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida. \"This was the first time in American history that a president unconstitutionally tried to remain in power illegally, and in my own view ... I believe that would merit prosecution,\" Cobb said. \"I think the president is in serious legal water, not so much because of the search, but because of the obstructive activity he took in connection with the Jan. 6 proceeding,\" Cobb said. \"I think that and the attempts to interfere in the election count in Georgia, Arizona, Pennsylvania and perhaps Michigan,\" he added. Asked about Trump's claims that he actually won the 2020 election, Cobb said, \"I believe former President Trump to be a deeply wounded narcissist, and he is often incapable of acting other than in his perceived self-interest or for revenge.\" '\"I think those are the two compelling instincts that guide his actions,\" Cobb said. \"He doesn't believe he lost. I believe that,\" he said."},

Biden's remarks about national unity on the 21st anniversary of the attacks stood in contrast to his warnings in recent days about dangerous divisions in American society, including that some Republicans who support former President Donald Trump's agenda pose a threat to democracy. \"I hope we'll remember that in the midst of these dark days, we dug deep. We cared for each other. And we came together,\" Biden said, as rain fell on troops standing behind him, flanking his defense secretary and top general. Nearly 3,000 people died in the attacks, when al Qaeda hijackers flew planes into New York's World Trade Center towers and into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, while a fourth plane crashed in Pennsylvania. Passengers on United Airlines Flight 93 overcame the hijackers and the plane crashed in a field, preventing another target from being hit. The anniversary comes a year after Biden ended the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan, launched two decades ago to root out the al Qaeda militant group that carried out the 9/11 attacks after plotting them from Afghanistan. Biden's chaotic withdrawal of U.S. troops last year and the resulting rapid fall of the country to the Taliban drew criticism from members of both political parties. But Biden vowed that the fight against terrorism would continue. \"We will not rest. We'll never forget. We'll never give up,\" he said. Last month, Biden authorized a drone strike in Kabul that killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, an Egyptian surgeon who had a $25 million bounty on his head and helped to coordinate the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. The disclosure of Zawahiri's presence in Kabul raised questions about the degree to which al Qaeda is receiving sanctuary from the Taliban. U.S. military and intelligence officials had warned that a complete U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan could allow al Qaeda as well as Islamic State to strengthen and, left unchecked, to eventually plot against the United States. Biden and others argued that the threat from terrorism has spread throughout the world over the past 21 years, and that there are better ways to combat it than open-ended military deployments and war. \"Our commitment to prevent another attack on the United States is without end,\" Biden assured. The first lady, Jill Biden, attended a ceremony in Pennsylvania on Sunday morning, while Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff attended one in New York City. In New York, key moments on 9/11, such as the times at which each tower of the World Trade Center fell, were marked with a moment of silence after the tolling of a bell. Families of victims of the 9/11 attacks have waited for years to see several of the people accused of planning and assisting the hijackers brought to trial and convicted, including self-professed mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four others imprisoned at the U.S. military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. On Sunday, Biden told reporters that \"yes, there is a plan for that\" \u2014 to hold the accused plotters accountable \u2014 but declined to comment further."},

The world's major democracies \u2014 with the notable exception of India \u2014 have banned the import of Russian oil. They are now negotiating a ban on insuring and shipping Russian oil to other countries, unless the sale is below a set price. They aim to restrict the amount of revenue the Kremlin receives, but keep Russian oil on the market to avoid supply disruptions. Key importers of Russian oil \u2013 China, India, and Turkey \u2013 have not yet said whether they will join in the coordinated price cap or negotiate their own side deals with Russia. Their participation could determine how much leverage Western nations have to set prices. \"It's premature to start discussing the price before the coalition comes together,\" a senior Treasury official told CNBC. Foreign leaders and financial officials will have several gatherings over the next two months \u2013 at the UN General Assembly in New York, meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington, and multilateral summits overseas \u2013 to discuss the mechanism. Negotiators expect that the Group of 20 nations \u2013 or, 19 with Russia excluded \u2013 will have made a decision by the time they gather in Bali, Indonesia, in mid-November. \"It will be the expectation that the G-20 countries will have been able, by that time, to communicate their possible participation,\" the European official said. Until then, no discussions of the specific price under which to allow sale of Russian crude oil, high-value refined products and low-value refined products have taken place among allies. \"We have notions of what figures can be, but it's just figures without a strong technical ground,\" the European official said. In recent days, G-7 negotiators formalized their intention to pursue the price cap, after announcing it at the conclusion of the recent Alpine summit. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested that the U.S. doesn't necessarily need China or Russia to participate for the policy to have its intended effect. \"We're already seeing this initiative pay off because countries that are buying Russian oil at greatly discounted prices,\" Yellen said on MSNBC after meeting with G-7 negotiators on Sept. 2. \"We're having an impact.\" A senior White House official said the Biden administration expects the price cap to go into effect by the end of the year.

In an announcement post on Facebook, Zuckerberg appears to be wearing a new headset, which is likely Project Cambria, a highly anticipated and powerful mixed-reality headset. The product and how it is received will be a key test of Zuckerberg's efforts to pivot the Facebook parent company to creating virtual reality and augmented reality hardware. Meta has spent as much as $10 billion a year on Zuckerberg's vision of creating the next major software platform, and the company has said one reason the technology hasn't taken off is that the hardware isn't good enough yet. The release timing of the product will give Meta an opportunity to gain a foothold in the market before Apple releases a competitive mixed reality headset of its own, reportedly as soon as next year. Zuckerberg said last month in an interview with podcaster Joe Rogan that the company planned to release Project Cambria in the fall. It's a hotly expected headset with the computing power to capture the real world with external cameras and display them inside the headset in real time and in color. The headset, which will likely cost $800 or more, will be significantly more expensive and capable than the current best-selling headset, the Meta Quest 2. Meta didn't announce a conference lineup on Tuesday, but the event is expected to last an entire day. It will be streamed online. In addition to revealing Project Cambria, Meta will also discuss updates to Horizon Worlds, its metaverse social networking app that has drawn mockery in recent weeks for its cartoonish graphics. The vice president in charge of Horizon is leaving the company, Meta confirmed in August. \"The graphics in Horizon are capable of much more \u2014 even on headsets \u2014 and Horizon is improving very quickly,\" Zuckerberg posted in August. In addition to Project Cambria, Meta is developing a slew of v arious virtual reality and augmented reality prototypes. The company believes the technology will eventually be used in a pair of lightweight glasses that can replace a user's smartphone."},

According to a study published Tuesday by Appsumer, Apple is gaining momentum in digital ads, while Google and Facebook appear to be losing steam. The research, based on an analysis of the online ad budgets of over 100 different consumer app companies, found that Apple's ad business has benefited from the company's major iOS privacy update in 2021, which made it more difficult for companies like Facebook to track users across the Internet. Apple's search ads let people advertise on the iPhone maker's App Store. Advertiser adoption rate for the second quarter rose almost 4 percentage points from a year earlier to 94.8%, while Facebook adoption fell 3 percentage points to 82.8%, Appsumer said. Google's rate declined 2 points to 94.8%. Apple has \"joined the duopoly of Facebook and Google at the top table of advertiser adoption,\" according to Appsumer, which is owned by InMobi. Shumel Lais, general manager at Appsumer, attributed Apple's improved standing to an increase in the number of app developers willing to pay big money to bolster downloads. At the same time, Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) update has limited the amount of data ad-based apps like Facebook can use to help brands with their online ad campaigns. \"One of the things that's quite interesting is the ATT measurement limitations that are kind of put on the wider network doesn't exist in the same way for Apple,\" Lais said. \"So you could say Apple has slightly more visibility or an advantage across the other channels on iOS.\" Apple's rise in online ads for developers mirrors Amazon's position in e-commerce, as retailers spend more money to promote their products on the site they rely on for customers. In terms of overall app developer spend on online advertising, referred to as share of wallet, Google remains at the top, with 34%. Facebook is second at 28%, followed by Apple at 15%. Amazon wasn't listed because it's not a platform for developers. At the lower end of the market, TikTok overtook Snap, which has also been hammered by ATT. TikTok has 3% market share, and Snap is at 2%, Appsumer said. Even though it topped Snap, TikTok's adoption rate dropped nearly 7 percentage points in the second quarter. Lais said app developers are still trying to figure out what ads work well on the short video service. \"Brands are maybe still adjusting to making TikTok work for every vertical,\" Lais said. The numbers weren't all bad for Facebook. Its share of wallet rose 4 points to 28% in the fourth quarter, indicating the social media company is experiencing some \"signs of recovery,\" Lais said. In July, Facebook parent Meta reported a stepper-than-expected drop in second-quarter revenue and said sales will drop again from the year-ago period in the third quarter. Lais said Facebook benefits from the serendipity of ads, versus Google and Apple, which serve ads based on search terms. \"Facebook still has very unique properties and people are in a mindset where they are in kind of a discovery mode, so there's still opportunity there,\" Lais said.

{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/29/apple-iphone-14-event-preview-september-2022.html", "title": "Apple's big iPhone 14 event kicks off Wednesday. Here's what to expect", "paragraphs": " Apple is holding a launch event at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, on Wednesday where it will unveil its latest hardware products, including the new iPhone 14. Apple has used prerecorded videos for its launch events since early 2020 thanks partly to Covid restrictions, and this will be the first iPhone launch with an in-person component since 2019. Apple is streaming the launch event online on its website and YouTube in addition to inviting some media to its campus. Apple's hype-filled fall launches are a signature event for Apple. They typically draw millions of simultaneous viewers on YouTube. They garner attention from around the world and set the stage for a holiday marketing blitz during the last three months of the year, which is when Apple's sales are the highest. This year's event has the tagline \"far out,\" which could refer to features such as night-sky photography. Last year, Apple released new iPhones and Apple Watches at an event in September, and then followed it up with an October launch featuring iPads and Macs. Here's what Apple is likely to launch Wednesday, based on reports. Apple is expected to release four new iPhone models. If Apple's current naming convention holds up, they will be called the iPhone 14. This year Apple will likely discontinue the \"mini\" model with a 4.7-inch screen, according to reports. Instead, Apple could offer two sizes, one with a 6.1-inch screen and one with a 6.7-inch screen, each coming in a standard model and a pricier \"Pro\" model. The Pro models are expected to get more upgrades, according to reports from Bloomberg News, TFI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, and other analysts and Apple watchers. Since 2017, iPhones have included a space at the top of the phone's display with space for Apple's FaceID system, which includes several sensors and a camera. The Pro models could ditch Apple's \"notch\" where it houses the FaceID camera for a slimmer, more streamlined \"pill\" or \"cutout\" approach with a smaller space that has to remain blank, leaving room for an even larger display. The Pro models are also expected to get upgraded A16 processors and cameras. The camera bump is expected to get larger. Apple could release an always-on screen display for showing notifications, like some Android phones have sported for years. Beta iPhone software released over the summer suggested that Apple may be planning a similar feature because of new widgets that show weather and battery life. One of the biggest questions is how Apple will price its iPhones in a period of inflation around the world and macroeconomic uncertainty in some regions. Other consumer electronics, such as Sony's Playstation 5, have seen price cuts. Apple's least-expensive iPhone 13 model is the $699 iPhone 13 Mini, which is expected to be discontinued. That would make Apple's mainline device, which is currently the iPhone 13, the least-expensive new model at $829, if its price doesn't change. Some analysts also expect Apple to increase the price of its Pro models. Apple usually drops the price of older models when it releases new ones, giving more price-sensitive consumers an option. Apple is likely to show the eighth major new version of its watch on Wednesday. Last year, the Apple Watch Series 7 got a slightly larger screen, but the redesign did not significantly change the look and feel of the device, which has remained mostly the same since 2014. Expect more evolution this year, too. Apple is considering a body temperature sensor in the new devices, according to the Wall Street Journal, which could help with fertility and sleep tracking. Other sleep tracking features could include the ability to detect advanced sleep patterns or apnea. But the biggest Apple Watch Series 8 announcement could be a new \"Pro\" model with a bigger screen and more durable finish. Apple has previously released Apple Watches with pricey case materials such as gold, ceramic and titanium, and the new \"Pro\" model described by Bloomberg and Kuo could be one of the first high-end Apple Watches to gain additional features over its less-expensive siblings. Also likely: A new updated version of the Apple Watch SE, its $329 entry-level Watch model. IPhone owners who don't plan to buy any new gear this fall will still get an annual update to the iPhones software, iOS 16, which was announced in June and has been in testing over the summer. The software has several new features that users will immediately notice. The biggest banner feature is the ability to customize the iPhone's lock screen with widgets that can display weather forecasts, calendar appointments and other information at a glance. Users can also change the font for the lock screen clock for the first time, as well. IOS 16 also lets you unsend or edit iMessage text messages, as long as you catch them within a few minutes of sending. IOS 16 will also introduce short-term loans from Apple called Apple Pay Later. The feature will allow users to buy stuff online with Apple Pay but pay for the item in four installments without paying interest. One cool feature in iOS 16 is if a user has both an iPhone and a Mac laptop or desktop, they can use the iPhone as a very high-definition web camera. Apple is unlikely to release new iPads on Wednesday because their software isn't ready yet. Earlier this month, Apple told TechCrunch that iPadOS, the iPad software, will ship after iOS this fall, suggesting a staggered release. Apple's statement was terse, and the company dislikes talking about unannounced products. But in general, it likes to release new hardware together with new software, so the statement clearly suggested that new iPads would come at a later launch date than iPhones. IPadOS and iOS are very similar, but this year iPadOS is getting a feature called Stage Manager that could allow users to multitask more efficiently \u2014 but also got panned by early testers. Improved iPads could include more powerful processors that are closers to laptop processors, smoother displays and better integration with accessories. Apple also uncharacteristically teased a new \"Mac Pro\" in the spring. The Mac Pro is currently a $5,000 tower of power using an Intel processor. Apple wants to transition its entire Mac lineup away from Intel to its own M-series processors, but a pricey niche product doesn't fit as well with Apple's mass-market iPhones and Apple Watches. Instead, new Macs could be announced at a separate event later this year, as happened last year."},

It comes as the company seeks to remain relevant in the mobile market after U.S. sanctions crippled its mobile phone business. The Chinese technology giant took the wraps off the Mate 50 smartphone on Tuesday, alongside the MatePad Pro tablet and Watch GT 3 Pro smartwatch. Huawei's Mate 50 boasts an updated camera with 4 lenses arranged in a circle on the back. The phone also runs Harmony 3.0, the latest version of Huawei's self-developed operating system, which was first released in 2019 after the company was cut off from using Google's Android software due to U.S. sanctions. The Mate 50 also does not have connectivity to super-fast 5G networks after U.S. sanctions cut off the company from the key chip required for this. Instead, the phone connects to previous generation 4G networks. However, Huawei claims this is the first smartphone released to the public that can connect to China's Beidou satellite networking. Beidou was completed in 2020 and is a rival to the U.S. government-owned Global Positioning System (GPS), which is widely-used across the world. Connectivity to Beidou means users can still send messages even when they lose connection to a terrestrial mobile network, for example, if they're in a remote area. The Mate 50 went on pre-sale in China on Tuesday and the starting price is at 4,999 yuan ($718), with the higher-spec Mate 50 Pro starting at 6,799 yuan ($1,006). Huawei is trying to retain relevance in the smartphone market after U.S. sanctions, which cut the company off from key components and software and crushed its business. Huawei was once the number one smartphone player in the world, but now holds a very small share of the market. The company is hoping its other products such as the tablet, smartwatch and other accessories can pick up some of the slack. But Huawei, which rose to prominence through its telecommunications equipment business, has pivoted to new growth areas over the last two years, including software and cloud computing. More recently, Huawei has been building out an automotive technology business with a focus on electric vehicles. But the Shenzhen, south China-headquartered firm is not manufacturing cars. Instead, it is partnering with automakers and providing the technology in various parts of the vehicle. On Tuesday, Huawei launched the AITO M5 electric vehicle in collaboration with Chinese automaker Seres. The car contains Huawei's Harmony OS operating system for the digital cockpit and infotainment system and includes a computing system to adjust the torque of the vehicle. Huawei said it helps to improve the control of the vehicle. A number of Chinese technology firms, including search giant Baidu and smartphone maker Xiaomi, have entered the electric vehicle market to grab a slice of the pie in the fast-growing EV market. Huawei has already launched cars alongside Chinese state-owned automakers BAIC and Changan."},

The queen, who at 96 was the U.K.'s longest-reigning monarch, died \"peacefully\" Thursday at Balmoral Castle, Scotland, hours after doctors expressed concern for her ailing health. Thousands of Brits gathered outside Buckingham Palace in the pouring rain following the news to pay their respects. The queen \u2014 whose 70-year reign spanned the aftermath of WWII, the winding down of Britain's vast empire, the 2016 Brexit vote and a global pandemic \u2014 had come to symbolize a rare constant in a world of constant change. She is succeeded by her eldest son, who was proclaimed King Charles III hours after her death. Her passing will be marked by a period of solemn ceremony, during which no government announcements will be made until after her funeral, which will be marked with a public holiday in approximately 10 days. The Bank of England has also postponed its monetary policy meeting by a week. The suspension of normal politics comes just days after the U.K. installed its new prime minister Liz Truss, who was appointed Tuesday by the queen herself, in her final act of public service. Truss enters 10 Downing Street at a time of unique flux for Britain, inheriting a country saddled with its worst economic outlook in years, a deepening energy crisis and increased inequality. Hours before the queen's death, Truss set to work outlining her plans to combat the U.K.'s cost-of-living crisis, unveiling a broad stimulus package designed to help Brits with energy bills, which have soared following Russia's war in Ukraine. It comes after a petition to boycott energy bills began gaining traction in the U.K. The Treasury says the package, which is set to cost over \u00a3100 billion, will lower peak inflation by 4-5 percentage points. But economists have warned that the move could complicate the Bank of England's already mammoth task of curbing record-high prices, by spurring spending on goods and wages. The U.K. central bank delivered its biggest rate hike in 27 years last month, raising the benchmark to 1.75%, in a bid to bring down in inflation, which is currently the highest among G-7 nations at 10.1%. Investors had widely expected a further 50 basis point hike when the BoE next meets, but some now say it will be forced to lift rates higher and more quickly. The uncertain outlook comes as the country faces rising recessionary risks. Goldman Sachs warned last week that the U.K. could fall into recession in the fourth quarter of this year, echoing earlier forecasts from the Bank of England. Briton's are now bracing for a winter of hardship for both household and businesses. The British pound has already been on a downward trajectory over the past several months, hitting a 37-year low of $1.1469 on Wednesday. It piles pressure not only on Truss but also King Charles, Britain's two new leaders, whose role it will be to rally public sentiment during a period of crisis. The pair are set to meet later Friday in London. The monarchy also faces ongoing criticism for being outdated and absorbing public finances. Indeed, the cost and ceremony of the queen's funeral will not be lost on a country in the grips of a cost-of-living crisis. \"King Charles has already got plans \u2014 we'll see them over the coming months and certainly years \u2014 to slim down the Royal Family,\" Andrew Roberts, a historian and professor at King's College London, told CNBC Friday. \"We are facing a massive cost-of-living crisis in the U.K., obviously, and what people want to see is the Royal Family reflecting that,\" he said, adding that there may be fewer royals participating in high profile events going forward. Truss on Thursday called on Britain to \"come together as a people\" and support its new head of state. \"Queen Elizabeth II was the rock on which modern Britain was built,\" Truss said in a speech outside No. 10. \"With the passing of the second Elizabethan age, we usher in a new era in the magnificent history of our great country.\" She added that Britons should rally round Charles III to \"help him bear the awesome responsibility that he now carries for us all,\" she added. \"God save the King.\""},

The value of the entire cryptocurrency market also fell below $1 trillion as digital coins across the board saw a sell-off. Bitcoin found its way back above $19,000 late in the day and was last trading less than 1% higher at $19,044.30, according to Coin Metrics. Ether, which has far outpaced bitcoin's gains in recent months, hovered below the flat line, at $1,571.20. Central banks around the world are battling rampant inflation with tightening monetary policy. The U.S. Federal Reserve has undertaken a series of interest rate hikes totaling 2.25 percentage points. Markets are expecting further interest rate rises. Policy tightening by the Fed has strengthened the U.S. dollar which has weighed on risk assets. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has also surged. Bitcoin has traded in correlation to stocks and so if they fall, in general, so does the cryptocurrency. \"The macro environment also continues to prove difficult with the dollar continuing to put in highs. This impacts all risk assets as we can see,\" Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, told CNBC. \"If we see the dollar start to move back down, then we should be able to get risk assets such as bitcoin move back up again.\" The crypto market has been battered this year with nearly $2 trillion wiped off its value since its peak in November. Bitcoin is about 60% off its record high of $68,990.90 that was hit in November. The sell-off has been caused by a tough environment for risk assets as well as crypto-specific issues including collapsed projects and bankruptcies that has spread across the industry. Bitcoin has been trading within a tight range of between $18,000 to $24,000 since June. Luno's Ayyar said that in forming a bottom, \"bitcoin typically likes to go back and test previous lows to see if they hold as support.\" He said that unless bitcoin falls below $17,500, then the market is likely consolidating within the $18,000 to $24,000 range. In the meantime, ether and so-called altcoins, or alternative coins, have managed to rise further than bitcoin. Ether has outpaced bitcoin since both cryptocurrencies hit a low in June. Ether is the native cryptocurrency on the Ethereum network. Ethereum is planning a huge upgrade this month \u2014 known as the merge \u2014 that proponents say will make the network more efficient, and draw in new investors and drive bigger yields. \"Ethereum hit yearly highs against the bitcoin pair in anticipation of the merge,\" Ayyar said. \" Hence there has been a lot more interest and activity in the Altcoin space, while Bitcoin consolidates.\""},

On Tuesday, the two companies announced that Tencent invested 300 million euros ($296.9 million) in Guillemot Brothers Limited, amounting to a 49.9% stake in the company. Tencent only gets 5% voting rights in the company. Guillemot Brothers Limited is controlled by the Guillemot family, and is the entity that controls the majority of the family's roughly 15% stake in Ubisoft. The Guillemot brothers founded Ubisoft in 1986 and have fought hard to keep the company independent and protected from a takeover. Tencent's investment values Ubisoft shares at 80 euros each, an 83% premium on Tuesday's closing price and gives it an indirect stake in the French games developer. The move effectively closes the door on a full takeover of Ubisoft by any party, according to analysts, something that investors were holding out for. \"What this transaction does appear to signal is that any full sale of Ubisoft to a strategic or financial buyer is very unlikely. In our view this should be seen as a net negative for shares (though not for the company itself),\" analysts at Cowen said in a note Tuesday. As part of the deal, Tencent is able to increase its direct stake in Ubisoft from 4.5% currently to 9.99% of the capital or voting rights. But Tencent will not be able to sell its shares for five years and will not be able to increase its stake in Ubisoft beyond 9.99% for a period of eight years. That effectively rules out a complete takeover of the gaming firm. Ubisoft's drama began in 2015 when French media conglomerate Vivendi took a stake in the European gaming firm, eventually becoming its biggest shareholder. But the Guillemot family were determined to keep the company independent. In 2018, after a three-year battle, Vivendi dropped its pursuit of Ubisoft. Tencent stepped in to buy some of the Ubisoft shares Vivendi offloaded and the Chinese tech giant ended up owning a 5% stake in the games company. Ubisoft has faced a number of challenges including sexual harassment allegations and a lack of new hit titles. Tencent's investment continues a flurry of deals in the video games space this year, particularly from Asian firms, that began with Microsoft's proposed $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard in January followed by Sony's takeover of Bungie, the maker of hit games Halo and Destiny. Tencent, based in Shenzhen, China, has grown into one of the world's largest gaming companies over the years, through acquisitions of and investments in smaller studios with popular global titles including League of Legends maker Riot Games, for example. Tougher regulation around gaming in China has pushed Tencent and its rival NetEase to expand overseas through investments and acquisitions. Ubisoft is known for some popular franchises including Assassin's Creed and Rainbow Six. Ubisoft scheduled an event for Saturday to reveal details about upcoming games. Tencent has typically helped companies it has invested in to run independently, but offered a hand to expand titles into China and onto mobile, where it has typically been strong. Martin Lau, president of Tencent, said that the two companies will continue \"to develop immersive game experiences\" and bring Ubisoft's most well-known franchises to mobile."},

One thing stood out, though: it put a new focus on safety features. Here's an overview of what's new. Emergency SOS is a new safety service that operates via satellite for iPhone 14 users. It will allow you to connect with emergency services even if you are outside of Wi-Fi or cell service range. It may be useful for folks who are stuck out on a hike, for example. Apple created a user experience that shows you where to point your phone to stay connected to a satellite as it moves. You can answer questions about the emergency through the interface, send text messages or connect to an emergency service through a relay center. Apple said it's free for two years but didn't say how much it will cost after that. Apple also announced a new Crash Detection feature for iPhone 14 and new Apple Watch Series 8, Apple Watch SE and Apple Watch Ultra users. It builds on Apple's fall detection that was already available in Apple Watch models. It's a feature we've seen before in other devices, like some of Google's Pixel phones, but it's the first time we've seen it in Apple's products. Crash Detection can identify front impact, side impact, rear-end and roll-over collisions in most popular types of vehicles, and the feature only runs when you are driving. In the case of an emergency, Crash Detection will auto connect you with emergency services, provide your location and notify your emergency contacts. Sporty Apple Watch Ultra users will have access to a range of safety features designed for extreme conditions. Apple redesigned the Compass app so you can retrace your steps and mark your location, for example, and recreational scuba divers can download the Oceanic+ app for access to safety warnings that they would otherwise expect on advanced dive computers. As the image above shows, it can alert you to a decompression safety stop while you're diving. The Apple Watch Ultra also has a new 86-decibel siren that can be heard up to 600 feet away, in case you're lost or stuck out in the elements and need people nearby to find you."},

It's huge. It's made out of titanium. It costs $799. And it's built for people who are into extreme sports, like diving and kite surfing, as it's twice as water resistant as the previous models. Apple designed the Ultra to be more rugged so it can withstand the elements better if you take it to the mountains or deep under water. There's a larger crown, too, so it's easier to use while you're wearing gloves if you're diving or in the snow. And it has a bigger screen. But it sure is chunky. Just look at it on my wrist: The screen has other cool features. It's twice as bright as before, so it's even easier to see outside. And it has a new \"Night Mode\" watch face that shows a compass and turns the watch red so it's easier to view in the dark. There's a new Action Button. It's orange, which definitely stands out, but can be customized to launch an app when you tap it. So, you can start a workout, mark a specific waypoint on a hike, launch your music app and more, just by tapping it. It's thicker than other Apple Watches, but includes some new functions like a depth gauge for real-time measurements under water. It also has up to 36 hours of battery life in normal use, or up to 60 hours on low-power settings. Apple says the 60-hour option is \"coming soon.\" That compares to 18 hours for the regular Apple Watch. The Apple Watch Ultra is available to order now and arrives on Sept. 23.

Speaking at Code Conference in Los Angeles, Pichai gave more details about how he\u2019s thinking of making the company run more efficiently ahead of economic uncertainty and a broader slowdown in ad spending, of which Google has been the largest beneficiary to date. \u201cThe more we try to understand the macroeconomic, we feel very uncertain about it,\u201d Pichai said on stage Tuesday. \u201cThe macroeconomic performance is correlated to ad spend, consumer spend and so on,\" he added. While he said he views macroeconomic factors as outside of his control, Pichai acknowledged the company has become \"slower\" after its headcount ballooned. \"We want to make sure as a company, when you have fewer resources than before, you are prioritizing all the right things to be working on and your employees are really productive that they can actually have impact on the things they\u2019re working on so that's what we are spending our time on.\" Host Kara Swisher asked the CEO how he planned to make the company more efficient, citing \u201cSimplicity Sprint,\u201d a recent internal project launched to re-focus the growing company and \u201cget better results faster\u201d as first reported by CNBC in July. While revenue is still growing, the effort came after the company reported its second consecutive quarter of weaker-than-expected earnings and revenue. However, prior to that, employees early in the year had given the company's leadership particularly poor marks on pay, promotions and execution, citing the company\u2019s growing bureaucracy, which executives acknowledged at the time. \u201cAcross everything we do, we can be slower to make decisions,\u201d Pichai said Tuesday. \"You look at it end-to-end and figure out how to make the company 20% more productive.\u201d Pichai also gave more specific examples of how he hopes to do that. He gave a past example of aligning YouTube Music and Google Play Music into one product. \u201cSometimes there are areas to make progress [where] you have three people making decisions, understanding that and bringing it down to two or one improves efficiency by 20%,\u201d he gave in another example. In a July all-hands meeting, HR chief Fiona Cicconi acknowledged industrywide concerns about layoffs, but said the company at the time was \"not currently looking to reduce Google's overall workforce.\" She did, however, add \"we can't be sure of the economy in the future.\" Host Kara Swisher pointed out a common term associated with Google employees working at the company for a long time called \u201crest and vest,\u201d which was depicted on the six-season HBO fictional show\n\"Silicon Valley,\" which referred to a Google-like company called Hooli.

In October, Jassy said Amazon would leave it up to individual managers to decide how often workers would be required to come into the office, which marked a sharp reversal from its earlier goal of returning to an \"office-centric culture.\" Jassy said Wednesday most employees have returned to physical offices and are spending some days working from home. Certain teams tend to be at the office more often, such as hardware or creative units, while others, such as engineers, continue to work largely remotely, he added. \"I do think there are some things that are harder to do remotely,\" Jassy said. \"I think it's a little harder to invent remotely.\" Jassy has previously said the Covid-19 pandemic could leave a lasting impact on how offices are used, noting that it has already affected how Amazon hires employees. For example, Amazon is now more open to remote work, and will recruit employees from any location, rather than just focusing on areas where it has \"critical mass,\" he said. Amazon's position on remote work differs from some of its tech peers. Google began requiring most employees to return to physical offices at least three days a week in April, which has generated some pushback among workers who oppose the mandate.

But the billionaire Tesla CEO will be allowed to add claims from a Twitter whistleblower to his countersuit, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick ruled. The trial is expected to begin Oct. 17, earlier than the mid-November date Musk's team requested in its latest push. \"I previously rejected Defendants' arguments in response to Twitter's motion to expedite, making clear that the longer the delay until trial, the greater the risk of irreparable harm to Twitter,\" McCormick wrote. \"I am convinced that even four weeks' delay would risk further harm to Twitter too great to justify.\" Still, McCormick said Musk's request to amend his counterclaim clears the relatively \"low bar\" of the court's rules for doing so. Musk's lawyers asked to add claims related to the whistleblower complaint recently made public by Twitter's former head of security, Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko. Musk's team argued the complaint, which detailed what Zatko alleged were egregious security failings by the company, would show Twitter breached its terms of the merger agreement if true. Shortly after Zatko's allegations became public, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal said in a memo to employees first reported by CNN that while they were still reviewing the complaint, it \"is a false narrative that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies, and presented without important context.\" Musk originally said he wants to exit the deal because he's received insufficient reassurance from Twitter about the percentage of its monetizable users that are actually spam accounts. McCormick said Musk's team would be entitled to only \"incremental discovery\" based on the new allegations, including \"targeted document discovery and minimal additional experts and fact witnesses.\" \"We are hopeful that winning the motion to amend takes us one step closer to the truth coming out in that courtroom,\" Musk lawyer Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel said in a statement. \"We look forward to presenting our case in Court beginning on October 17th and intend to close the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk,\" a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement.

The company disclosed during Apple 's annual fall hardware launch event that it would be operating a satellite-powered emergency SOS service for the forthcoming iPhone 14. The stock closed down 1% but was up about 2% after hours. The stock quickly gave up most of those gains and is currently trading up about 5% for the day, after being down more than 10% prior to the announcement. Nonetheless, the stock move shows how exposure to a large technology company such as Apple can have a significant impact on a smaller entity's operations. In early 2020, Globalstar said it had agreed to provide services for a \"potential customer\" that it did not name. On Wednesday Globalstar revealed in a regulatory filing that customer is Apple. A copy of the agreement shows that Apple can elect to receive warrants to buy up to 2.64% of Globalstar's outstanding stock at $1.01 per share. But Apple isn't obligated to receive the warrants. Globalstar now sees 2023 revenue between $185 million and $230 million, depending partly on the degree to which it achieves goals tied to its Apple deal. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had previously expected $130.6 million in 2023 revenue from the company. \"The Company expects these financial metrics to continue to improve significantly by 2026, which is expected to be the first full year in which the new satellites are operational, with total revenue expected to increase by approximately 35% compared to the 2023 forecast driven primarily by revenue growth under the Partnership Agreements,\" Globalstar said. Apple agreed to pay Globalstar for 95% of approval capital spending tied to the new satellites and other costs, according to Wednesday's filing. Globalstar said that as part of the agreement, it must raise more debt capital to to launch the new satellites. A satellite connection for iPhones had been expected at least since 2021. Analysts at B Riley, who have a buy rating on Globalstar stock, said in a note last month that they suspected the potential mystery customer was Apple. Apple said on Wednesday that a compatible iPhone's antennas will be able to connect to a satellite and communicate in places where there's no regular cellular connectivity, and that a phone will compress a message to accelerate delivery to a ground station, which can then pass the message to emergency responders. Globalstar's infrastructure launched in the late 1990s through a partnership with Loral Space and Communications and Qualcomm.

But the biggest surprise from Apple is something that didn't happen: a price increase. Despite surging inflation around the world and supply chain challenges that have made it more challenging to procure parts, Apple said the entry-level iPhone 14 will start at $799, the same amount that it initially charged for last year's iPhone 13. The successor to the iPhone 13 Pro, the iPhone 14 Pro, remains at $999. Apple's highest-end iPhone, the Pro Max, still starts at $1099 for the new version. Analysts had been expecting some price hikes in Apple's lineup. In holding steady, Apple didn't want to further dent demand with the risks of a deteriorating economy already threatening to crimp consumer spending. IDC expects global smartphone shipments to decline over 6% this year, although mostly in the lower-end categories where Apple doesn't compete. Apple shares rose about 1.4% on Wednesday to $156.61. Apple did make one tweak to the lineup that could increase the average selling price of an iPhone. The company eliminated the iPhone 13 Mini, which was the least-expensive model, at $699. It's been replaced by the iPhone 13 Plus, a bigger model with a 6.7-inch screen and an $899 price tag. Apple also introduced a pricey new Apple Watch, the Ultra, with a bigger screen and more rugged titanium case, which starts at $799. But even that device is less expensive than Apple's Edition models, which cost as much as $10,000 when introduced in 2014, and is in line with more recent editions with titanium cases that started at $799. The other new Apple Watch models, the Series 8, are consistent with previous prices. Apple raised the entry-level price for a new Apple Watch by eliminating the Series 3, an older model that was retailing for $199. The least-expensive new Apple Watch is now the SE, which starts at $249, or $30 less than the older SE version. Apple also introduced a new version of its AirPods Pro wireless earbuds at $249, which is unchanged from the previous model. While U.S. prices were largely flat, Apple sets prices in each country and they can sometimes differ from the American price converted into a foreign currency.

Between January and the end of August, the domestic box office generated around $5.3 billion, down around 31% compared to 2019. It remains on pace to deliver around $7.5 billion in total ticket sales by the end of the year. For comparison, in 2019 the box office tallied $11.4 billion for the full year. There are other factors leading to this decline in box office, including a significantly smaller number of film releases. Only 46 films have been widely released domestically during the first eight months of the year. During the same period in 2019, 75 films had been released widely. On the plus side, moviegoers are now spending more when they go to cinemas, opting for higher priced tickets to see films on premium screens and buying more concessions. Iger noted that cinemas aren't the only place for audiences to see the birth of major franchises. \"I think the movie industry used to argue that you could not create cultural impact without having everybody go to a movie theater on the weekend in every country in the world,\" he said. \"And then just couldn't create franchises. I don't agree anymore.\" Iger pointed to HBO's \"Game of Thrones\" and Disney's own \"The Mandalorian\" as series that have made significant impacts on the cultural zeitgeist without assistance from cinemas. \"It doesn't mean moviegoing goes away,\" Iger said. \"I'm a big believer in movies. I love big movies ... but it doesn't come back to where it was.\""},

Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said in a Tuesday note that Apple will likely raise prices on its iPhone 14 Pro models by $100 over last year's iPhone 13 Pro. That sentiment was echoed in notes from JPMorgan and Credit Suisse. Apple's iPhone 13 Pro starts at $999 while the iPhone 13 Pro Max, which has a bigger screen, starts at $1,099. Sacconaghi said Apple is likely to retire the $699 iPhone 13 mini and replace it with a more expensive and larger iPhone 14 Max, which he said will cost about $899. The iPhone 14 Max may help Apple increase the average selling price of its iPhones by offering the much-larger screen that has otherwise been reserved for the more expensive iPhone Pro Max models. Apple is also expected to sell a standard iPhone 14 with the same size screen as the iPhone 13. Credit Suisse analysts said they'll be watching whether price increases impact demand in countries where the U.S. dollar has strengthened. \"While we think there will be some pressure, we believe the proliferation of installment plans will significantly lessen the impact as customers will only need to pay the equivalent of a few more dollars per month per device,\" Credit Suisse analysts said. Analysts at JPMorgan anticipate a price increase for iPhone 14 Pro models because of inflation and supply chain pressures, but they don't expect Apple to raise prices for the regular iPhone 14. The analysts said a price bump would matter more for the company's wearables like the Apple Watch. \"Pricing is a key watch-point in a tough macro which comprises inflationary pressures and pull back in consumer spending, but we believe it matters more for Wearables which are considered more discretionary purchases relative to iPhone by consumers,\" they wrote in a Tuesday note. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report."},

We quickly ran over to take a peek at the new iPhone 14 Pro to show you what it's like. As you can see above, it looks a lot like last year's model from the back. But, there are some noteworthy changes. Unsurprisingly, the cameras are even better \u2014 Apple highlights camera improvements every year \u2014 and include a 48-megapixel sensor for even sharper photos and to let in more light. The big changes are on the screen and inside. There's new satellite connectivity, for example, which allows you to point the phone toward a satellite to send a message or call emergency services where you don't have cellular service. The Pro also boasts an always-on display that lets you quickly peek at notifications, see what music is playing, track a flight, and more, without having to wake your screen up every time. You can just leave your phone on your desk and glance over whenever you want to see what's going on. It's similar to a feature that's been on Android phones for years. There's also a new pill-shaped cutout that replaces the blank \"notch\" that had previously housed the camera and Face ID sensor. The camera and sensor are still there, just hidden. It can show you notifications or status updates, and even the album art of the song you're playing. Here's a peek: It's super small in person, so here's a better look at what Apple showed during the event: You can tap that pill to view the song you're playing, or more information about a notification that's in the space. Apple calls the feature \"Dynamic Island\" and says it will work with alarms, AirDrop, flight alerts, AirPod pairing and charging indications, notifications about the status of your Lyft ride and more. Other changes to the Pro, which starts at $999, include a new, faster A16 processor with improved graphics and car crash detection. The iPhone 14 Pro goes on sale Friday and arrives Sept. 16.

Currently, texts between iPhones use iMessage, which has a much smoother experience than when an Android device texts an iPhone, in which SMS messages show up as green bubbles. Google wants Apple to adopt RCS, a kind of messaging that is meant as a next-generation SMS replacement with encryption and other modern features. The questioner pressed Cook, saying that he can't send videos to his mom because of the limitations of SMS messaging. \"Buy your mom an iPhone,\" Cook said. Cook was joined by former Apple head designer Jony Ive and Laurene Powell Jobs to discuss the legacy of Apple's founder and announce a new Steve Jobs archive and potential documentary. Apple's recent privacy push is not a new goal for the company \u2014 the thinking actually goes back to founder Steve Jobs, Cook said. \"S teve really ingrained in the company in the early days in the importance of privacy and it has only grown since,\" Cook said. Cook cited a 2010 talk by Jobs where he said that privacy means that users consent to share their data. \"Privacy means people know what they're signing up for, in plain English, and repeatedly. That's what it means,\" Jobs said in the talk cited by Cook. Cook's remarks come as the company's privacy push has drawn increasing criticism as self-serving as the company has introduced new privacy features that make online advertising more difficult to measure as Apple reportedly plans to increase the size of its advertising business and introduces new ad units. That's the same philosophy behind App Tracking Transparency, a feature introduced in 2021 that has roiled the online advertising industry. iPhone owners are asked before sharing a unique device identification number with apps when they boot up \u2014 and most iPhone owners choose not to, preventing online advertisers from accurately tracking the performance of their ads. Companies including Facebook parent Meta have blasted the change as anticompetitive. In February, Meta said it would cost it $10 billion this year. \"What we felt is that people should own their data, and they should make their own decision,\" Cook said on Wednesday. \"People should be empowered to be able to make that decision in a really straightforward and simple manner. Not buried 95 pages deep in a privacy policy somewhere.\" Cook elaborated that Apple follows stricter rules than advertisers and defended the company's search ads. \"We've never said digital advertising is a bad thing,\" Cook said. \"What is not good is vacuuming up people's data when they're not doing so on an informed basis.\" Cook was asked if he saw Apple as a powerful company that has stepped in because regulators haven't passed privacy laws. \"We're not trying to be a regulator,\" Cook said. \"All we're trying to do is give people the ability to make the decision for themselves.\""},

Nvidia disclosed last week that the U.S. will require the chipmaker to get a license for future export to China for certain products, in an effort to reduce the risk of them being used by the Chinese military. \"We believe this will not have an impact on our business operations,\" William Li, founder, chairman and CEO of Nio, said via the company's translator during an earnings call Wednesday. That's according to a StreetAccount transcript. \"Based on our estimations, our computing power is sufficient for our autonomous driving technology development in the aspect of the AI training for now,\" Li said. \"And we have been working very closely with our partner Nvidia.\" The Nvidia Drive Orin chip has become a core part of assisted driving tech for Nio and other electric car companies in China. An online Nvidia blog post described how Nio's new ES7 SUV came with four such chips, including one that enabled the car to learn from individual driver preferences. The new U.S. restrictions target Nvidia's A100 and H100 products, whose sales are part of the company's far larger data center business. The products are graphics processors that can be used for artificial intelligence. Li said Wednesday there are many companies in China with artificial intelligence training chips, and that Nio is evaluating opportunities to work with different companies. But he said the U.S. restrictions would not affect Nio's long-term strategy. Last week, automaker Geely said it won't be affected by the new restrictions, as did autonomous driving start-ups WeRide and Pony.ai. Earlier this week, Chinese financial news site Caixin reported that He Xiaopeng, chairman of electric car start-up Xpeng, said the restrictions would bring challenges for all autonomous driving algorithm training on cloud computing platforms. But he said the company has bought enough of the high-tech products to meet demand for the coming years, according to the report.

The six plaintiffs include Coinbase employees and other users of the mixing service that was blacklisted by the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in August. Mixing services like Tornado Cash are used to obfuscate crypto transactions, which while anonymous, are easily traceable. The Treasury Department argued this particular service was used to launder more than $7 billion worth of digital currency in the past three years by North Korean hackers and other bad actors. But in some cases, mixing services are used for legitimate privacy reasons. One plaintiff, a senior security risk analyst at Coinbase, used the service to anonymize donations to Ukraine out of fear his address would be targeted by Russian hacking groups. Another had concerns about his family's security. \"Each is an American who simply wants to engage in entirely lawful activity in private,\" according to the lawsuit. The sanctions were a unique move by Treasury to blacklist open source software, versus an entity or person. Crypto enthusiasts have argued that the move was an overstep, sets a new legal precedent and could cause negative ripple effects for the tech industry. \"We saw this as a much larger problem,\" Coinbase's chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, told CNBC. \"It sets a dangerous precedent -- if this code can be designated without any limits imposed by law, any technology any tool or system could be fair game.\" Grewal, former deputy general counsel at Facebook, said it could have a chilling effect on innovation. He likened the Tornado Cash scenario to police chasing armed robbers on a highway. In order to catch the criminals, \"we wouldn't ban all use of that highway.\" Grewal said it was the first time Coinbase has financially supported an external lawsuit and plans to pay for the plaintiffs' lawyers, as well as other costs associated with pursuing the claims in federal court. Thursday's suit argues that the move went a step beyond Treasury's authority, and as Coinbase put it in a blog post uses \"a hammer instead of a scalpel.\" The plaintiffs argue it caused financial harm as their money is still locked on Tornado Cash, and hurt users relying on the tools for privacy reasons. The case asks the Court to remove Tornado Cash smart contracts from the U.S. sanctions list. Coinbase is the largest U.S. crypto exchange by trading volume and has publicly advocated for crypto reforms in Washington, while dealing with a series of recent SEC probes. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently requested information from Coinbase about the listing of cryptocurrencies that the agency argues may have been unregistered securities. The SEC is also looking into its crypto rewards program, known as staking. \"We have advocated for regulatory reform across Washington and that work will continue,\" Grewal said. \"We can continue to cooperate and partner with the agencies that are being challenged in this instance, because this is not about questioning anyone's good faith, but it is about assuring that the rule of law applies.\""},

With rampant inflation persisting and a global recession on the horizon, all eyes were on how Apple priced its main product during the Cupertino giant's big event on Wednesday, where it revealed four iPhone 14 models. One of the biggest surprises was that in the United States, Apple kept the prices of the iPhone 14 series the same as what it was charging for the equivalent iPhone 13 model. The iPhone 14 base model will start at $799, the same amount that it initially charged for last year's iPhone 13. The highest price iPhone 14 Pro Max starts at $1,099, the same as the iPhone 13 Pro Max. However, Apple has raised the price in some of its biggest markets globally. The latest Apple smartphones will be a test of global consumer appetite for new electronics and put U.S. tech giant's brand power on trial. Here are some comparisons of the iPhone 14 base model versus the iPhone 13 in various countries. U.K. Australia Japan Germany Other models have steeper price increases. For example, the iPhone 14 Pro Max in the U.K. is \u00a3150 more expensive than the equivalent last year's model. Analysts said part of the reason behind the rises could be increasing costs of components and the appreciation of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies in the markets where Apple has hiked prices. \"The key takeaway is the Euro and Yen has depreciated quite a bit translating to slightly higher prices,\" Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC. On Wednesday, the British pound fell to its lowest level against the dollar since 1985. The euro remains roughly at parity with the dollar and the greenback continues to appreciate against the Japanese yen. Apple kept the price of the iPhone the same in mainland China, one of its most important markets. Apple's greater China revenue segment, which includes the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan, was its third-biggest region by sales in the second quarter of the year. Apple's iPhone 14 is priced at 5,999 Chinese yuan ($862), with the Pro Max starting at 8,999 yuan. China has seen a resurgence of Covid this year. Authorities are sticking to their \"zero-Covid\" policy, which has led to lockdowns of major cities including the financial metropolis of Shanghai and production hub of Chengdu. That has hurt the economy and dampened consumer appetite. Market research firm IDC expects the Chinese smartphone market to contract by 13% this year, falling below 300 million device shipments for the first time since 2012. That could be one reason Apple has not changed its iPhone pricing in China. \"I won't be surprised if part of the rationale to keep prices flat there is to sustain demand in such a difficult environment, and in such a strategically important market for Apple at that,\" Bryan Ma, technology industry analyst at IDC, told CNBC. Apple continues to find success in China, particularly in the higher-priced premium segment of the market. Apple held a 70% market share in the $600-plus smartphone segment in China in the second quarter, up from 58% in the first quarter, IDC said. Much of that can be attributed to the demise of Huawei, whose smartphone business has been hit by U.S. sanctions, leaving a gap for Apple to fill. \"Keeping prices flat helps Apple to retain its user base and fortify its position in China,\" Ma said."},

Personal cars sit parked about 95% of the time, according to a study by the RAC Foundation. And they take up valuable real estate in urban areas. Roads and parking occupy nearly a quarter of Manhattan, for example, while only 22% of households in the borough owns a car, according to census data. Cars were banned on a stretch of Broadway by Times Square in 2009. While initially controversial, this change quickly decreased traffic accidents, especially those involving pedestrians, and increased foot traffic in the neighborhood, according to HR&A Advisors. There's also been an effort by a coalition made up in part by unions and health public health organizations to turn 25% of the land used by cars into land for people in New York City by 2025. \"I think it's proved itself over and over. It is a very good example of what you can do when you take space away from single occupancy motor vehicles and give it to people on foot or on bikes,\" said Eric McClure, the executive director and treasurer of StreetsPAC. Creating pedestrian plazas like the one in Times Square is prevalent in many European and Asian cities like Amsterdam and Tokyo. They prioritize public transportation and cycling infrastructure while U.S. cities often favor cars. \"I think the young people broadly are kind of dissatisfied with the status quo of what cities look like,\" said Paul Stout who runs the urban developing TikTok account 'TalkingCities.' \"There's this big push for walkable cities and transit-rich places.\" Culdesac, a real-estate developer, is appealing to younger generations' desire for walkable cities by creating the United States' first walkable community built entirely from scratch. The development in Tempe, Arizona, which is set to begin opening toward the end of 2022, is fully-equipped with e-scooters, rentable EVs, e-bike storage and is connected to the local light rail system. It also has retail and community spaces like a park and pool, and residents will get a discount on ride share services. Lyft co-founder John Zimmer is on the board. The company said it has raised $200 million in real estate capital. For U.S. cities to become more walkable, the implementation of congestion tolls, reduced and paid parking, could be necessary. Cities could convert some of this space into pedestrian plazas, outdoor-retail space as well as add cycling and public transportation infrastructure. \"Once there's an emphasis on the quality of the public realm, you're making life better for many, many people,\" said Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk who is an architect, urban designer and professor at the University of Miami.

{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/08/clean-hydrogen-industry-got-huge-boost-from-inflation-reduction-act.html", "title": "The clean hydrogen energy economy was a dream. The climate bill could make it a reality this decade", "paragraphs": " A tax credit tucked into Inflation Reduction Act could turbocharge the nascent clean hydrogen industry and turn it into a multitrillion-dollar business in the coming decades. The tax credit will spur hydrogen producers to develop cleaner ways to synthesize hydrogen, which is used to make fertilizer and in other industrial processes. But it could also catalyze a whole new category of companies looking to use clean hydrogen as a replacement for fossil fuels in areas such as shipping, aviation, heavy industry, and as a way to store and transport energy. Currently, 98 percent of hydrogen is made in a way that uses fossil fuels, according to the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. But \"all the current hydrogen producers are looking to produce clean hydrogen,\" explained Elina Teplinsky, a lawyer who serves as the spokesperson for the Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative, a group working to advance the development of the nuclear hydrogen industry. The law will make it more economically feasible to use carbon capture and storage technology to reduce the carbon emissions from hydrogen creation. It will also open the door to a whole range of companies looking for cleaner ways to make hydrogen, and to use hydrogen as a replacement for fossil fuels in certain areas. By 2050, between 60 and 80 percent of hydrogen production will be powered by renewables, according to a November report on the industry published by the Hydrogen Council, an industry group, in collaboration with McKinsey & Co. (This prediction was published before the tax credit was passed.) This kind of industry transition will require a lot of investment \u2014 as much as $7 trillion to $8 trillion through 2050. But on the plus side, by that date the hydrogen economy could generate about $3 trillion in annual revenue, according to the Hydrogen Council and McKinsey report. Currently, roughly half of the hydrogen produced is used to make fertilizer and ammonia, with the balance used in petrochemical refineries or production, according to the Center on Global Energy Policy. The push for clean hydrogen is motivated both by a need to decarbonize current processes and because the use cases for hydrogen are expanding. Industrial applications, which make up nearly all the demand for hydrogen today, will represent only 15% of total hydrogen demand by 2050, according to the Hydrogen Council/McKinsey report. Hydrogen has the highest energy per mass of any fuel and does not release any carbon emissions when it is burned or turned to electricity in a fuel cell. Entrepreneurs and advocates believe hydrogen could be useful to decarbonize some very large sectors of the economy like long-haul trucking and industrial processes including making iron and steel, maritime cargo shipping, and aviation. \"If it weren't for climate change, we probably wouldn't be expanding into all of these new use cases\" for hydrogen, Emily Kent, the U.S. director of zero-carbon fuels at Clean Air Task Force, a global climate nonprofit, told CNBC. The largest end use for hydrogen by 2050 is expected to be mobility, including heavy trucking, long-range flights and container ships, according to the Hydrogen Council/McKinsey report. In these cases, hydrogen would produce electricity through a fuel cell, in which hydrogen atoms and oxygen atoms are combined in an electrochemical reaction to generate electricity, heat and water. Current electric battery-powered vehicles can't meet this need because batteries that could store enough energy for long-haul journeys would be too heavy and would take too long to recharge, Kent explained. A hydrogen tank and fuel cell would weigh less, take up less space and have the refueling time similar to gas or diesel. \"It's possible that there'll be huge breakthroughs and batteries or something else that would change things. But as it stands today, there aren't great solutions,\" Kent told CNBC. Hydrogen can also be burned to produce electricity in a turbine, similar to natural gas. Currently, up to 20% hydrogen can be blended with natural gas burned in conventional natural gas turbines without needing to do any infrastructure changes, according to Kent. \"For higher blends of hydrogen or pure hydrogen, we'll likely need adjustments to the turbines and infrastructure,\" Kent told CNBC. \"There are companies working on 100% hydrogen-ready infrastructure where pure hydrogen can be burned in a turbine to produce electricity.\" Hydrogen can be a way to store energy, which is going to be critical as renewable energy like wind and solar are ramped up and deployed across the country. Wind and solar energy don't work when the wind doesn't blow or the sun doesn't shine, and so energy has to be stored somehow to be able to provide continuous, reliable energy. Meanwhile, battery technology is being ramped up, but batteries are not yet at the point in their development where they can store enough energy for long enough to make them sufficient backup for a fully renewable grid. \"If you produce a ton of solar in the summer, and you want to store a bunch of it away for the winter, hydrogen can be stored for sort of that many monthslong seasonal periods, and provide electricity back to the system when it's needed,\" Kent said. Cleanly produced hydrogen is also being considered as a replacement for coking coal in a key part of the process in producing steel, a heavy-emissions industry which is considered a real challenge to decarbonize. And clean hydrogen will be needed for industrial processes that require especially high-grade heat, temperatures above 752 degrees Fahrenheit, like cement plants, glassmaking, and aluminum remelting, according to the Hydrogen Council/McKinsey report. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, but here on Earth, it only exists in compound forms with other elements \u2014 particularly with oxygen as part of water. Separating the hydrogen from the other atoms requires industrial processes and energy. Currently, China is the largest producer of hydrogen, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a bipartisan, nonprofit policy research organization. Of the hydrogen that China makes, 60 percent is made using coal and about 25 percent comes from using natural gas, according to CSIS. Outside of China, the largest hydrogen producers are industrial gas companies like Linde and AirProducts, according to Teplinsky. Seventy-six percent of hydrogen produced globally and 95% in the U.S. is produced with a process called steam methane reforming, in which a source of methane, like natural gas, reacts with steam at very high temperatures, according to the Center on Global Energy Policy. Natural gas releases greenhouse gas emissions when burned, and also from so-called fugitive methane leaks as it's extracted and transported. Globally, 22% (and 4% in the U.S.) is made with a process called coal gasification, where coal reacts with oxygen and steam in hot temperature and high pressure. Some companies are working to capture the carbon dioxide emissions from these processes and store it in tanks underground. Hydrogen made this way is sometimes called \"blue hydrogen.\" More promisingly from an emissions perspective, an electrolyzer can be used to split a water molecule into hydrogen and oxygen, and it can be powered with almost any energy source \u2014 including zero-emissions sources like solar or wind, creating what is known as \"green hydrogen.\" Today, two percent of the hydrogen made globally and 1 percent in the U.S. is made with an electrolyzer. Nuclear energy can also be used to power hydrogen synthesis with almost no additional CO2 emissions (this is sometimes called \"pink hydrogen,\" but the nomenclature varies). As a bonus, the steam and heat produced as byproducts of nuclear energy can be used in a high temperature electrolysis process, which is much more efficient. And with the advanced nuclear reactors in development that run at even hotter temperatures than conventional nuclear reactors, hydrogen can be produced in a thermo-chemical water-splitting process that doesn't use an electrolyzer at all. Because the majority of the cost of producing hydrogen with electrolysis is the cost of the electricity that goes into it, making hydrogen with nuclear energy and steam \"really could have a tremendous contribution on lowering the costs of clean hydrogen production,\" Teplinsky told CNBC. The cost of producing hydrogen with these different methods varies tremendously and swings based on input costs, like natural gas and the source of power. Because of the Russian war in Ukraine and climate change, these input costs have themselves been swinging. A report published by nonpartisan nonprofit Resources for the Future in December 2020 said a kilogram of hydrogen made with steam methane reforming cost between $1 and $2 (including the costs of some carbon capture). Hydrogen made with electrolysis powered by wind and solar ranged from between $3 and $7 per kilogram. That's where the tax credit comes in. The tax credit in the IRA is available for 10 years and scales depending on how clean the hydrogen production is. If hydrogen is produced without releasing any carbon emissions, the tax credit is maxed out at $3 per kilogram of hydrogen produced. It then scales down proportionally based on the amount of emissions released, as long as it's less than current production techniques. If hydrogen is produced with some carbon emissions, but fewer than are emitted in current production techniques, the tax credit is incrementally smaller, proportional to the emissions reductions. The tax credit is \"an absolute game-changer,\" Akshay Honnatti, the leader of EY's sustainability tax division for the United States, told CNBC. \"There was no incentive to have hydrogen be cleaner. It costs to get hydrogen to be cleaner,\" Honnatti added. \"Now there's a credit available for someone to make that additional level of investment and be able to justify that level of investment to their stakeholders and shareholders.\" The $3 per kilogram credit makes nuclear hydrogen highly competitive with fossil fuel produced hydrogen, Teplinsky said. The U.S. Department of Energy has as a goal, one of its Energy Earthshots Initiatives, to reduce the cost of clean hydrogen to $1 per kilogram in a decade. For many of these burgeoning use cases for clean hydrogen, the tax credit included in the climate bill is going to give companies the chance to enter the market for making clean hydrogen without losing money. \"They could go back to their shareholders, and they can say, 'Look, we can we can do this economically \u2014 today. We don't have to project a loss for the next five years to enter this market. We can actually enter this and have it be economic, or at least a breakeven project in the near future,'\" Teplinsky said. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed in November also included $8 billion to develop regional clean hydrogen hubs in the U.S. Between the two laws, the U.S. should be able to develop a clean hydrogen economy in seven to eight years, Teplinsky said."},

The streamer's historic Oscar win for Best Picture was overshadowed by an altercation between actor Will Smith and comedian Chris Rock in March, but big wins at Monday's Emmys could cement the service as one of the most reputable content providers in the streaming space. \"Apple TV+ follows a 'less is more' strategy,\" said Peter Csathy, founder and chairman of advisory firm Creative Media. \"Fewer titles but bigger names and premium quality.\" In recent years, Csathy noted that Apple TV+ has built a small but critically acclaimed catalog that is \"almost becoming the new HBO,\" which was known for quality series prior to its merger with HBO Max. Apple TV+, which has been around for less than three years, has earned 52 total Emmy nominations across 13 different titles in 2022. HBO and HBO Max notched 140 nominations combined and Netflix received 104. Apple TV+'s breakout hit \"Ted Lasso\" is up again for Outstanding Comedy Series, while its new show \"Severance\" is on the ballot for Outstanding Drama Series. Competition in both categories is steep, in part because of new entrants like \"Squid Game,\" \"Yellow Jackets\" and \"Abbot Elementary.\" This is also the last year of eligibility for \"Better Call Saul\" and \"Ozark.\" Earlier this year, Apple TV+ won the Best Picture award at the Oscars for \"CODA,\" marking the first time a streaming platform got the top prize. Troy Kotsur, who starred in the film, also became the first deaf man to win an Oscar for acting. Already, streaming services have used the prestige associated with Hollywood nominations or awards to encourage subscriber sign-ups or sign top talent. Over the past decade, Emmy awards for shows like \"Orange Is the New Black\" and \"The Crown\" have burnished the reputation of Netflix, enabling the service to bring on top talent like Ryan Murphy, Shonda Rhimes and Guillermo del Toro. Such prestige is even more critical for Apple, which has long partnered with the biggest names in music and Hollywood for its cachet. That's because the primary goal for Apple TV+ is to sell Apple products \u2014 not to garner hundreds of millions of subscribers. \"Apple has always used content as marketing for its products,\" said Csathy. \"For Apple, the streaming service is just the means to the end \u2014 and the end is more sales of iPhones, Macs, Apple TVs, etc. As long as Apple TV+ screams quality, then it serves its purpose in Apple's overall engine.\" Though streaming services generally provide limited metrics, Apple has been particularly quiet since it launched its streaming video platform in November 2019. Unlike many others in the space, the company does not disclose data about financial performance, content spending or subscriber numbers for individual shows or the service as a whole. (Even \"Severance\" executive producer Ben Stiller has expressed frustration about Apple's vague statistics.)\nWhen Apple CEO Tim Cook is asked about the service, he usually points to nominations and awards, suggesting that's the metric Apple is using to judge its success.\n\"In two and a half years since launch, Apple TV+ has now earned 250 wins and over 1,100 award nominations and counting,\" Cook told analysts on an earnings call in July. In June, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi estimated that the service has between 20 million and 40 million subscribers and that is generates around $1 billion to $2 billion in annual revenue. That would be a drop in the bucket compared to the company's overall balance sheet, which tallied $366 billion during fiscal 2021. Apple TV+'s spending on content is estimated to pale in comparison to rival streamers. Netflix is expected to spend around $17 billion on content this year and Disney about $32 billion spread across its media divisions. By contrast, Bernstein suggests Apple spends just north of $3 billion, while Rayburn estimates the number to be closer to between $1 billion and $2 billion. Those projections would suggest that the service could be losing money. Dan Rayburn, a media and streaming analyst, noted that there's no clear data showing Hollywood recognition translates to increased subscribers. But for Apple, he noted that calculation really doesn't matter. \"If Apple TV+ gets 10 million subs, or they get 20 million subs, does it move the needle from a revenue standpoint? No.\" said Rayburn. \"They don't even have to disclose to Wall Street because it's not a material impact on the company.\" \u2014 CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report."},

Amazon said 159 employees will be laid off from Amazon Care, based on Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) filings submitted late Thursday. The WARN Act requires employers to provide advance notice, generally within 60 days, of mass layoffs or plant closings. Another 236 employees will be let go from Care Medical, a team of clinicians that was charged with treating Amazon Care patients, according to a separate WARN notice also filed Thursday. Care Medical is an independent company that was contracted to work with Amazon. The layoffs are slated to begin Dec. 1, according to the filings. Amazon said late last month that it will wind down its telehealth service after Dec. 31. The company chose to shutter the service after determining it wasn't \"a complete enough offering\" for customers, Amazon said. Amazon Care was one piece of Amazon's strategy to upend the health-care industry, alongside its pharmacy and consumer diagnostics ventures. Even after shuttering Amazon Care, the company has continued its expansion into health care. In July, Amazon said it would acquire One Medical for $3.9 billion, bringing in a network of boutique primary care clinics. Amazon Care launched in 2019 as a pilot program for employees in and around the company's Seattle headquarters, before expanding to serve other employers. The service provides virtual urgent care visits, as well as free telehealth consults and in-home visits for a fee from nurses for testing and vaccinations. At the time that Amazon announced it would shutter the service, the company said in a memo to employees that it would give them the opportunity to find roles elsewhere at Amazon. \"Many Care employees will have an opportunity to join other parts of the Health Services organization or other teams at Amazon \u2014 which we'll be discussing with many of you shortly \u2014 and we'll also support employees looking for roles outside of the company,\" Amazon Health Services lead Neil Lindsay wrote in the memo. An Amazon representative reiterated in an emailed statement that those affected will have the opportunity to find other jobs internally. \"Our priority continues to be supporting our employees during this transition,\" the statement said. In the second quarter, Amazon shaved its headcount by 99,000 people to 1.52 million employees. The retail giant is taking steps to shrink its workforce as it looks to cut costs after growing its staff and warehouse footprint at an unprecedent pace during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Former Vice President of Gigafactory Operations, Chris Lister, left Elon Musk's electric vehicle and clean energy business this summer, and Hrushikesh \"Hrushi\" Sagar was promoted to oversee the Gigafactory, according to audio of a Thursday meeting and documents shared with CNBC by people who work at the factory. Sagar reports directly to CEO Elon Musk and will also be overseeing Tesla's vehicle assembly plant in Fremont, California, simultaneously. Sagar spoke to a group of hundreds of Gigafactory employees on Thursday afternoon about management changes, performance reviews, factory milestones, and aggressive new goals for the facility. He also disclosed some information about progress in Tesla's factories in Austin, Texas, and outside of Berlin, Germany. Sagar briefly addressed Lister's departure saying, \"I really appreciate what Chris Lister did here, Chris's contribution. I'm very thankful, like Elon, and Tesla is very thankful, for his contribution, but at the same time now we are moving on to the next phase.\" Workers at the Gigafactory manufacture battery packs and power trains for Tesla's electric vehicles, as well as the big backup batteries, Powerwall and Megapack, sold by Tesla's Energy division. During the meeting, Sagar celebrated the fact that Tesla made around 134,000 cars in its Fremont, Calif., factory in the second quarter of 2022, and said that August was one of the record months for Fremont in terms of production. The Fremont factory is now able to make around 12,000 cars per week and is aiming for 14,000 per week as its next goal, he said. He also said that Tesla's team in Brandenburg, Germany, recently hit a milestone of being able to produce 1,000 cars on a rolling seven-day basis. Musk recently visited the German factory and the company expects it to ramp production to make 5,000 cars per week by the end of 2022. Initially, Reno was sending drive units to Germany to aid in that effort. Tesla's new factory in Austin, Texas also hit the 1,000-per-week production rate. In terms of drive unit production, the Gigafactory produced 283,473 power trains in the second quarter of 2022 \"feeding\" the company's Fremont and Austin factories. \"You all played a very big role,\" Sagar said. \"I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart,\" to the Reno team. Before he joined Tesla in late 2017, Chris Lister spent 22 years in precision manufacturing roles at PepsiCo. During his tenure at Tesla, the Gigafactory experienced a rapid build-out and growing pains including high volumes of scrap, fires and oil spills. But in ramping up production there, he also helped propel Tesla to become the top-selling battery electric vehicle brand in the U.S. and world. Lister and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Sagar's new title, according to his LinkedIn profile, is senior director of vehicle operations and manufacturing engineering. Sagar told employees on Thursday that they should think of the Fremont factory as their \"customer,\" noting that vehicle production there succeeds or is hampered depending on Gigafactory shipping volumes and quality. While Sagar does not plan to spend most of his time in Reno, he plans to work closely with leaders at the plant, including Energy Leader Matt Reddick, who joined the company about six months ago, and Site Leader Eric Montgomery, who will manage things day-to-day in Nevada. Other top leaders at the Gigafactory now include Jeff Jackson, who is heading up infrastructure for the facility, and Bert Somsin, a human resources director for the plant. At the same meeting on Thursday, Montgomery told Gigafactory employees that they need to get to a steady output of 8,800 high voltage battery packs per week to support Fremont's new production goals, and \"maximize all-wheel-drive builds.\" He said August 2022 was also the Gigafactory's second-best month on record for production, second only to October 2021. Reddick said Tesla can now produce 42 giant Megapack batteries in a seven-day rolling period. Megapacks are about the size of a shipping container and are used for utility-scale energy storage, often to store excess energy generated by wind or solar. Tesla is on target to produce 442 Megapacks during the third quarter of 2022, representing an 85% growth over Megapack production in the previous three-month period. The Gigafactory also hit and has exceeded a production rate of 6,500 Powerwalls per week. Powerwalls are the smaller backup batteries for home use that CEO Elon Musk recently promoted on Twitter amid a massive heatwave in California. The heat wave threatened blackouts, and had the state urging residents to reduce their power consumption during peak hours. Tesla previously required customers who wanted to buy a Powerwall also to buy a solar roof from the company. The Nevada Gigafactory made 37,600 Powerwalls in the second quarter, Montgomery said, and said the facility is on target to increase that by 22% in the third quarter. In terms of the facility itself, Jackson touted a new, advanced water treatment facility that Tesla is building on site. \"This is to going to eliminate the discharge of our site process water, or wastewater, and it's going to allow for 98% water recycling and evaporation,\" he said. \"It's a huge thing, it's aligned with our mission.\" Jackson also gave an update on the Gigafactory's solar roof. \"Right now we've got about eight megawatts on the roof that we're able to use on a daily basis, which is really exciting,\" the infrastructure leader said. Tesla also has a new food vendor on site that provides poke bowls, is building a meditation room for employees, and is making road improvements and installing more EV chargers along the roads around the facility. On the human resources front, workers were urged to reduce the number of labor hours it takes to produce a single unit of the products they build in their teams, and to file more \"take charge\" notices about how to improve safety and reduce costs around the plant. The company is moving past steep headcount cuts that took place in the second-quarter this year, and is in the midst of an extensive, performance review process, Sagar said. One employee asked management if their equity grants would be tied to company milestones this year, and management said no. But human resources teams and managers are still figuring out who may be eligible for promotions, raises and bonuses. Sagar said by the end of September, managers should be speaking with their teams about their performance assessments. Employees asked management to discuss whether and where Tesla's next factory may be built. Lobbying activity by Tesla in Canada, and the company's investments up North previously have stirred speculation of a Canada-based plant. Sagar said, \"I have some idea on the candidates but I don't think I'm at liberty right now to disclose those candidates because of the confidentiality around some of those things.\" He did offer, \"There is an exciting future for North America and all around the Americas.\""},

Tesla said the plant would be focused on the development of \"battery-grade lithium hydroxide\" and be \"the first of its kind in North America,\" according to a newly released letter to the Texas Comptroller's Office. The company would process \"raw ore material into a usable state for battery production\" then ship the lithium hydroxide to various Tesla battery manufacturing factories, the application said. In April, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company may need to get into lithium refining because the cost of the metal had \"gone to insane levels.\" The price of lithium is up 120% this year, according to an tracking index from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. Tesla's move is also likely a bid to diversify the supply of its lithium and battery production. China controls more than half of the world's lithium processing and refining, and the United States just 1%. As part of the application to Texas, the company said it is also considering \"other battery materials processing, refining and manufacturing and ancillary manufacturing operations in support of Tesla's sustainable product line.\" If Tesla's application is approved, construction could begin in the fourth quarter of 2022, the company said. The project will reach \"commercial operations\" by the fourth quarter of 2024. Tesla said that it is still \"evaluating the feasibility of this project\" and \"only very preliminary development activities have begun.\" No engineering, construction or procurement construction contracts have been negotiated or signed and no regulatory permits have been obtained, Tesla said. Musk's firm said the project could be located \"anywhere with access to the Gulf Coast shipping channel.\" Tesla said it is evaluating a competing site in Louisiana. Tesla said the only way this project will be viable is if Texas gives it tax breaks under its law. \"In the case of the investment on this proposed project in Texas, the decision will be based on a number of commercial and financial considerations, including the ability to obtain relief regarding local property taxes,\" according to the application. Lithium is a critical metal for batteries that go into everything from electric cars from smartphones. Given the strategic importance of such rare earth metals and China's mining dominance of them, there has been concern from Washington that Beijing could cut off critical supplies of lithium and other materials. The U.S. is looking to ramp up its own rare earth refining and mining industry to catch up with China. Here's the letter:"},

The world's largest cryptocurrency was last trading 10% higher at $21,268.25, after falling below $19,000 earlier in this week and to its lowest level since mid-June. Other digital coins were higher including ether which was up around 5%. The total cryptocurrency market value jumped back above $1 trillion again. The latest leg higher for bitcoin has been sparked by a slight weakening of the U.S. dollar which has seen a stunning rally this year. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of other currencies, was down about 1% on Friday morning. U.S. stock indexes closed higher on Thursday and futures were higher Friday. Bitcoin has been closely correlated to U.S. markets often rising when stock indexes do. Bitcoin also tends to rise when the dollar weakens. Bitcoin has been trading in a range of around $18,000 to $24,000 since June and has not been able to break that pattern. Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, said that Friday's rally could be a \"bearish retest\" of the $22,500 to $23,000 price. \"Hence unless it breaks that level convincingly and closes above, I would still think this is a bearish rally that could see more ranging and downside,\" Ayyar said. Bitcoin has been battered this year and is more than 60% off its record high seen in November as the Federal Reserve has hiked interest rates aggressively taking the shine of risk assets such as cryptocurrencies. The crypto market has also been hit by failed projects and high-profile bankruptcies which have spread across the industry. Crypto markets have been anticipating a major network upgrade to Ethereum called the merge, which proponents say will make the blockchain more efficient. The merge is expected to be completed by mid-September. In the run-up to the event, the price of ether, the native token of Ethereum, has far outpaced bitcoin. Financial markets are also looking for signs of cooling inflation when the U.S. Consumer Price Index is reported next week. And investors are also keeping an eye on signals about the Fed's rate hike path. On Thursday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he is \"strongly committed\" to fighting inflation, suggesting further rate raises could be coming. If inflation cools and with anticipation around the Ethereum merge, Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese crypto exchange Bitbank, said bitcoin could test the $22,000 level, but also offered a warning. \"Given what some Fed members, including chair Powell, said this week, too much optimism could be dangerous,\" Hasegawa said in a note on Friday."},

Terms of the deal weren't disclosed. Amazon began working with Cloostermans in 2019, using its technology to help move and stack heavy palettes and goods, as well as package products together for delivery, the retail giant said. Cloostermans will become part of Amazon Robotics, Amazon's division focused on automating aspects of its warehouse operations. The unit was formed after Amazon acquired Kiva Systems, a manufacturer of warehouse robots, for $775 million a decade ago. Amazon continues to launch new machines in warehouses. In June, the company unveiled a package ferrying machine called Proteus, which it referred to as its first fully autonomous mobile robot. It's also deployed other robots that can help sort and move packages. In a blog post, Ian Simpson, vice president of Global Robotics at Amazon, said the company is investing in robotics and other technology to make its warehouses safer for employees. \"As we continue to broaden and accelerate the robotics and technology we design, engineer and deploy across our operations, we look forward to welcoming Cloostermans to Amazon and are excited to see what we can build together,\" Simpson said. The prospect of warehouse robotics improving safety has been a topic of debate. An investigation by Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting found Amazon's warehouses with robots have higher injury rates than facilities without automation. Founded in 1884, Cloostermans began as a repair shop for textile companies and went on to build industrial machines. As a result of the acquisition, Cloostermans' team of roughly 200 employees will join Amazon Robotics, Amazon said. WATCH: Inside Rivian's deal with Amazon"},

Oz, a physician and veteran television show host who is facing Democrat John Fetterman in the race for Pennsylvania's open Senate seat, owns along with his wife at least $615,000 in shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific, according to his financial disclosure. Thermo Fisher Scientific's website lists hydroxychloroquine sulfate as one of its available products. It is unclear when Oz and his wife bought the stock, or whether they owned it as Oz promoted hydroxychloroquine as a Covid treatment early in the pandemic. Oz and his wife also own between $15,001 and $50,000 in McKesson Corporation stock, according to the disclosure. The company labels and distributes hydroxychloroquine sulfate, according to the FDA. It is also unclear when they bought McKesson stock. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is the anti-malaria drug commonly known as hydroxychloroquine, according to the Food and Drug Administration. Doctors around the country, in part boosted by endorsements from former President Donald Trump and conservative media figures, have offered the medication to patients as a Covid treatment despite its questionable efficacy against the virus. Oz's financial ties to a producer and distributor of the drug, and his promotion of it as a potential Covid treatment, raise questions about what he stood to gain from its wider use during the pandemic. If he wins the Senate election, he could also face conflicts of interest as Congress grapples with a still evolving coronavirus pandemic. In a statement responding to CNBC questions about Oz's relationships with companies that make or distribute hydroxychloroquine, including when he and his wife bought the Thermo Fisher Scientific stock, Oz campaign spokeswoman Brittany Yanick did not address the candidate's financial holdings. \"At the outset of the pandemic, Dr. Mehmet Oz spoke with health experts worldwide who were seeing hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as viable treatment options for desperately ill COVID patients. He offered to fund the clinical trial at Columbia University,\" she said. The FDA has approved hydroxychloroquine to fight malaria, but warned it has \"not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing COVID-19.\" Oz took bold steps early in the pandemic to promote its usage as a treatment. He urged Trump administration officials in 2020 to back a study he aimed to fund at the Columbia University Medical Center about the effect of hydroxychloroquine on Covid-19 patients, according to emails obtained and released by the House select subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis. Oz also has ties to third company that says it divested hydroxychloroquine from their U.S. portfolio. Sanofi, which is headquartered in France and previously made hydroxychloroquine, for years supported Oz's nonprofit, HealthCorps, according to the group's annual disclosure reports. Between 2009 and 2018, Sanofi was listed as either a sponsor or in-kind supporter of the Oz-funded group, which promotes itself as aiming to help teens with their health and wellness. In 2013, Sanofi is listed as one of the group's \"school sponsors.\" HealthCorps' website says a school sponsor must donate $100,000 to qualify. Sanofi announced in April 2020 that it would donate 100 million doses of hydroxychloroquine to 50 countries around the world as studies assessed the drug's efficacy in treating Covid-19. A spokesman for Sanofi told CNBC that the company has no involvement with Oz's comments about Covid-19 or hydroxychloroquine. He explained that Sanofi divested hydroxychloroquine from its U.S. portfolio in 2013 and investigated the use of the drug at the start of the Covid pandemic as a possible way to fight the virus. Once it was deemed ineffective against Covid-19, the company's work on it ceased. The spokesman also explained that the company's last financial contribution to HealthCorps came in 2011. The company representative later corrected himself in a follow up email to CNBC after publication of this story and said that 2013, was, in fact, the last year Sanofi gave a financial donation to HealthCorps. Oz's ties to companies that would benefit from wider use of hydroxychloroquine could pose issues for the Republican if he wins the Senate seat. Kedric Payne, an ethics attorney at the Campaign Legal Center, told CNBC in an email that Oz could choose to divest from the companies if he were to defeat Fetterman in November. \"He may be in for a rude awakening if elected because ethics rules could bar him from this activity. Senators cannot use their positions to promote any goods or services that financially benefit them,\" Payne said. \"Oz could voluntarily divest the stock if elected or stop promoting anything tied to his stock.\" A spokesman for Thermo Fisher Scientific declined to comment. A representative for McKesson did not return a request for comment before publication. Since he launched his campaign late last year, Oz has downplayed warnings by the FDA and other experts against using hydroxychloroquine as a Covid treatment. He suggested political animus against Trump, who endorsed the drug as a treatment and Oz in the Senate election, motivated criticism of the drug as a means to fight Covid. \"Now, let me just say this real quick, I really don't know if it works or not, we still to this day had not been able to prove if it [hydroxychloroquine] works or not, which is a shame, because we should have known by now if a cheap 70-year-old drug used by a billion people works or not,\" Oz said at a campaign rally earlier this year. \"But we don't, which is a problem by itself. However, I mentioned it and then President Trump mentioned it in a press conference, and all of a sudden the entire world hated hydroxychloroquine without testing it, without knowing about it.\" Before he launched his campaign, Oz more explicitly championed hydroxychloroquine. During a Fox News interview in March 2020 at the height of the pandemic, Oz said that \"hydroxychloroquine plays a role\" in fighting the virus. A graphic on screen while Oz was being interviewed called the anti-malaria drug \"promising\" as a Covid-19 treatment option. Oz also sought the White House's help in kickstarting the hydroxychloroquine study he hoped to fund at Columbia, where he was once vice chair of the surgery department. He has since said the study never got off the ground. The Pennsylvania candidate's communications with White House officials were released by the House select subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis last month. In a March 2020 email to former Trump White House coronavirus response coordinator Deborah Birx, Oz said he would recruit patients and pay for the hydroxychloroquine trial himself. Also in March 2020, Oz emailed Trump's son in law and advisor Jared Kushner that \"we must make completion of this study a national priority and insist on immediate enrollment,\" according to the correspondence obtained and made public by the House committee. Kushner responded to Oz on the same day, \"What do u recommend to speed it up?\" The New York Post reports that Oz spent $8,800 at that time on hydroxychloroquine tablets for the study and offered to spend $250,000. Oz, while campaigning for Pennsylvania's Senate seat, blamed then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for halting the study after he effectively banned the anti-malaria drug as a Covid treatment. Oz's financial ties could become a bigger issue for him if he wins the Pennsylvania race, one of a handful of contests that will decide which party controls the Senate next year. A Real Clear Politics polling average shows Fetterman leading Oz by almost 7 percentage points. Stock ownership in Congress is facing increased scrutiny. Some lawmakers have proposed a ban on individual stock trades in Congress, which would require lawmakers to put assets in a blind trust or divest entirely. Business Insider has identified at least 71 lawmakers who have violated the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, or STOCK Act. The law aims to stop members of Congress from trading stocks off of insider information gained from their work as lawmakers. However, members of Congress have broadly faced few repercussions for lucrative stock trades."},

Now the company wants advertisers to join the party. As part of its annual developer conference on Friday, Roblox is announcing plans to debut ads next year, marking the company's first significant effort to diversify its business beyond virtual goods in games. Prior to the rollout, Roblox said it will be testing ads with unspecified developers and brands by the end of this year. Manuel Bronstein, Roblox's chief product officer, said the company has already tried out some online ads with brands like Warner Bros. and Vans. The ads were displayed in an experimental ad format that Roblox referred to as \"portals,\" he said. He also said the company remains committed to its core business, which allows gamers to spend real money on the virtual currency Robux that can be used to level up and buy items in games. \"We have an amazing transactional economy, and we will continue to invest in it,\" Bronstein said. He characterized the company's push into online ads as a \"good strategic bet\" that's \"early\" in its development. Roblox debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in March 2021, and saw its market cap swell past $80 billion in November, as investors poured into high-growth tech stocks. But this year's economic slowdown has punished those businesses, with Roblox losing 60% of its value in 2022. In August, Roblox reported second-quarter financials that missed on both the top and bottom lines, and revenue growth slowed to 30% from more than 100% a year earlier. The company said in its quarterly filing that it generates \"substantially all of our revenue\" from the sale of Robux. Roblox CEO David Baszucki told CNBC in February that the company has \"many opportunities to increase monetization\" and he cited advertising and 3D immersive shopping as potential areas for growth. To date, the company has focused on \"creating a safe and civil platform\" and growing its daily active user base, Baszucki said. Roblox describes its upcoming ad offering as immersive ads, though there's not yet a standard format for how they will appear. Bronstein speculated that future ads in the metaverse \u2014 an online world where people socialize, work and learn \u2014 could resemble digital billboards that people can use to buy goods like shoes, or even branded digital coffee cups. In the portal ad tests, when users interact with the brand, they can be automatically transported to the company's virtual Roblox community, Bronstein said. At this stage, companies are just trying to understand how ads can function in Roblox and other metaverses. Regarding Warner Bros. and its recent Roblox test, Bronstein said \"they were fascinated by the results.\" Roblox is jumping into online ads during a period of turbulence in the market. Meta's Facebook business and Snap have been particularly hurt by Apple's privacy changes in iOS, which make targeting more difficult. The economic slowdown has led a number of companies to pull back on ad spending, and TikTok's emergence has added a new avenue to the mix. Meanwhile, Amazon and Apple are bolstering their ad businesses, as companies that rely on those platforms are spending more money to get in front of consumers. With that backdrop, Roblox will have to prove its value before brands will open their wallets in any meaningful way. Businesses could use their metaverse ads \"as connections with the real world,\" Bronstein said. For instance, a company's branded digital item could function like \"a coupon to go buy something at a store\" in the physical world. Roblox faces the additional challenge of serving ads on an app that's predominantly used by kids. All Roblox ads will be labeled as \"immersive ads\" and children under the age of 13 will not be able to interact with them, the company said. The company is also adding more guidelines to let parents and children know which virtual experiences are suited for certain age groups based on criteria like violence.

Demetre Daskalakis, deputy head of the White House monkeypox response team, said it took 25 days for cases to double in August, down from eight days in July. California, New York, Illinois and Texas have all seen significant declines in new cases over the past month, Daskalakis said. \"The positive trends that we're seeing in this data also speak to the actions of individuals taken across the country to protect themselves against the virus that includes changing their behaviors and seeking out testing and vaccines,\" Daskalakis said. The U.S. is still battling the largest monkeypox outbreak in the world with nearly 21,000 cases reported across all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Monkeypox is primarily spreading during sex among gay and bisexual men, though anyone can catch the virus through close physical contact with someone who is infected or contaminated materials such as towels and bedsheets. The disease is rarely fatal, but causes painful lesions resembling pimples or blisters. The Biden administration faced criticism over the summer for not moving quickly enough to ramp up vaccine supply to meet the tremendous demand for the shots. Health Secretary Xavier Becerra declared a public health emergency last month, and the Food and Drug Administration authorized a different method to administer the vaccines that allows providers to extract more doses from each vaccine vial. The Jynneos vaccine, manufactured by Danish biotech company Bavarian Nordic, is the only approved monkeypox vaccine in the U.S. It is administered in two doses 28 days apart, with the peak immune response coming two weeks after the second dose. The CDC does not yet have real-world efficacy data on the Jynneos vaccine, though public health officials expect it to provide protection against monkeypox. Vaccine supply has expanded significantly since early August. The U.S. has administered more than 460,000 monkeypox vaccines doses so far, according to data from 35 states provided to the CDC. About 1.6 million gay and bisexual men face the highest risk from monkeypox and have been the primary focus of vaccination efforts. The Black and Hispanic communities are particularly hard hit by the virus. Nearly 38% of patients are Black, 29% are Hispanic, and 27% are White, according to CDC data. The overall U.S. population is 12% Black, 19% Hispanic, and 61% White, according to data from the 2020 Census. Daskalakis said the CDC and the White House have been working with organizations in Black and Brown communities to improve vaccine access. Vaccinations were offered on site at Atlanta Black Pride over the Labor Day weekend with 4,000 doses administered, according to Robert Fenton, head of the White House monkeypox response team. The U.S. is offering vaccinations on site at Pride and other events with high attendance by gay and bisexual men to make the shots more available. More than 3,000 doses were administered at Southern Decadence in New Orleans, according to Fenton. The U.S. is providing 820 doses to Boise Pride and 10,000 doses for California ahead of the Folsom Street Fair and the Castro Street Fair, Fenton said. Daskalakis said federal health officials are also working with colleges and universities as school gets back into session to inform them about the resources and tools available to address monkeypox in the event that there are infections on campus, though the risk is low. \"The risk in colleges is extremely low,\" Daskalakis said. \"Realistically, given the way that this virus is spreading through the population, the risk in those settings is low. Awareness is more important than anxiety,\" he said. People who have monkeypox should stay at home until the rash has healed and a new layer of skin has formed, stay away from other people, and do not share any objects or materials with other people, according to CDC guidance. People who have a new or unexplained rash should avoid sex and social gatherings, particularly those where there's close skin-to-skin contact, according to CDC. People can also reduce their risk of infection by temporarily limiting sexual partners until two weeks after receiving the second dose of the monkeypox vaccine."},

The undertone of Apple's iPhone 14 launch this week was darker. After zooming in on Apple's headquarters from space, it kicked off with a video highlighting users who wrote letters to Apple CEO Tim Cook saying that they almost died \u2014 but were saved by their Apple Watch calling 911. \"Dear Apple: My dad was flying our small plane to Vermont. I was asleep in the back seat. I woke up when we were crashing into the tops of the trees. The plane broke into six pieces and we were miles away from civilization in the freezing cold. Then, all of a sudden, my Apple Watch started ringing,\" said one character named Hannah. Other characters in the short video told stories of falling into a frozen stream, getting trapped inside a trash compactor and witnessing a cardiac episode in a restaurant. Saving lives in emergency situations was the major theme of Apple's launch this year, and many of the most notable new features the company announced were oriented toward safety. The most significant new iPhone capability this year is called \" Emergency SOS via satellite,\" which can send a message for help even if there's no cell service around for miles. Users can also share their location with family or friends in the Find My app. Apple's example of how the feature works showed a hiker with a broken leg on top of a mountain ridge calling for a helicopter. Later, Apple mentioned winding back roads as another place where iPhone users might be out of range. But this feature could be useful in outside wilderness settings. Wildfires, hurricanes and other disasters can cut cell service, and having the ability to contact emergency services or tell your family where you are can literally be a lifesaver in those circumstances. Another example: Apple's $799 or more watch, the Ultra, has an 86-decibel siren that can be heard 600 feet away, and compass features that allow the user to retrace their steps without the internet. As with the satellite feature, Apple advertised it as a helpful tool for backcountry adventurers, but it could also be useful in more mundane settings. Imagine sounding the alarm as a deterrent to an attacker, or using the retracing feature to find your way back to your car after a disaster in your community has interrupted cell service. Apple also announced this week that iPhones and Apple Watches, using motion sensors, can now call 911 if they detect a car crash has occurred. \"We truly hope you never need it, but that you will feel a little bit safer every time you get in the car,\" an Apple presenter said, moments before showing images of a driver getting hit by an air bag in slow motion after crashing. Apple's launch events are designed to do one thing: build demand for Apple's new products. The company now wants to make the iPhone even more \"essential\" for its users through safety features, giving users reasons not to switch to competing Android devices. Will these features meaningfully increase iPhone adoption and sales? It turns out, Apple has at least considered the possibility in the past. In a disclosure with the ESG group CDP published in January 2019, Apple representatives wrote about potential business opportunities stemming from climate change, citing a previous version of the \"SOS\" feature as an example of Apple's work to build features for emergency situations. \"As severe weather events become more frequent, consumers may come to value more highly the immediate and ubiquitous availability of reliable mobile computing devices for use in situations where transportation, power and other services may be temporarily interrupted,\" Apple representatives wrote. Apple cited the 9/11 disaster and \"extreme weather events\" like hurricanes Katrina, Sandy, and Harvey that are occurring more frequently. \"Over time, as people begin to experience severe weather events with greater frequency, we expect an increasing need for confidence and preparedness in the arena of personal safety and the well-being of loved ones,\" Apple wrote in the disclosure. Apple's not the only consumer electronics company that is developing safety features for its devices. But Apple's devices also have a robust lineup of health features, like fall detection for seniors and heart monitoring, which underscore its overall safety pitch. \"iPhone is there when you need it most,\" one presenter said at the launch event. \"That confidence is especially important in moments where your safety is at risk.\" We may be seeing the start of a new messaging strategy at Apple: Its devices are the ones you want when things go wrong."},

In a report published Thursday, the CDC found that 38% of nearly 2,000 people diagnosed with monkeypox between May and July were living with HIV. Among 1,300 monkeypox patients with more detailed clinical data, 8% of HIV-positive individuals were hospitalized compared with 3% of people without HIV infection. The CDC found that HIV-positive individuals in particular with low T-cell counts, which indicates a weaker immune system, and in whom the virus is not suppressed are hospitalized more frequently with monkeypox. But data on the reason for hospitalization is incomplete so it's unknown whether HIV-positive people hospitalized with monkeypox are suffering from more severe disease, according to the CDC. People living with HIV in previous monkeypox outbreaks in Nigeria did have poor outcomes. Monkeypox is primarily spreading during sex among gay and bisexual men, though anyone can catch the virus through close physical contact with someone who is infected or contaminated materials such as towels and bedsheets. Men who have sex with men have HIV infections more often than the general population, according to the CDC. But the 38% of monkeypox patients who also have HIV is far higher than than the rate observed among the broader population of gay and bisexual men, the study found. The percentage of monkeypox patients who have HIV has also increased over time, which suggests monkeypox may be spreading more in networks of people who have HIV, according to the agency. The CDC found a major racial disparity among people who have HIV and monkeypox. Black and Hispanic patients had monkeypox and HIV at a far higher rate \u2013 63%, and 41% \u2013 respectively, than white patients at 28%. Monkeypox is disproportionately impacting Black and Hispanic populations. Nearly 38% of monkeypox patients are Black, 29% are Hispanic and 27% are white, according to CDC data. The overall U.S. population is 12% Black, 19% Hispanic and 61% White, according to data from the 2020 Census. People with HIV who also have monkeypox are reporting some symptoms more often such as rectal pain and proctitis. Monkeypox causes a rash, which resembles pimples or blisters, that often develops on sensitive areas such as the anus or genitals. The CDC officials who authored the study said vaccination against monkeypox should be prioritized for people who are HIV-positive and who have other sexually transmitted infections. People evaluated for monkeypox should also undergo HIV and STI screening, the authors said. Some 41% of monkeypox patients were diagnosed with one or more STIs over the past year, according to the CDC study. Health-care providers should also offer patients medication such as PrEP, which helps lower the risk of getting HIV through sex. The CDC has estimated that 1.6 million gay and bisexual men who are HIV-positive or who are taking medication to reduce their risk of HIV face the highest threat from monkeypox. More than 460,000 monkeypox vaccine doses have been administered so far. Department of Health and Human Services officials have said the U.S. is approaching the point where there are enough doses available to fully vaccinate the highest-risk population. The U.S. is battling the largest monkeypox outbreak in the world, with more than 21,000 cases reported across all 50 states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico, according to CDC data. White House health officials said Wednesday that the outbreak appears to be slowing as vaccinations ramp up, though the racial disparity in people diagnosed with monkeypox is growing."},

Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina is set to start operations in 2025, with the firm stating that total investment in the plant will now amount to $3.8 billion. Norm Bafunno, who is senior vice president, unit manufacturing and engineering at Toyota Motor North America, said the announcement marked \"another significant milestone\" for the business. The additional investment in the U.S. is part of a wider investment of up to $5.6 billion in battery production, with Toyota noting that demand for battery electric vehicles was growing. To this end, the business said it would aim to ramp up \"combined battery production capacity\" in the U.S. and Japan by as much as 40 gigawatt hours. As well as diesel and gasoline vehicles, Toyota is known for its hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell offerings. It is also attempting to make headway in the increasingly competitive battery-electric market, where firms like Tesla and Volkswagen are jostling for position. This has not been without its challenges. In June 2022, Toyota issued a safety recall for more than 2,000 of its all-electric SUV, the bZ4X. Toyota may be looking to invest billions in EV battery production, but on Wednesday the business stressed it would also \"continue to make every effort to flexibly meet the needs\" of customers \"in all countries and regions by offering multiple powertrains and providing as many options as possible.\" Indeed, the website of Toyota Europe states that the \"internal combustion engine continues to be the most popular means of powering vehicles and it will continue to play a role for the next 20 to 30 years.\" All the above comes at a time when major economies are laying out plans to reduce the environmental footprint of road-based transportation. Just this month, the California Air Resources Board approved a rule that will require all new car sales in the state to be zero emission by the year 2035. Elsewhere, the U.K. wants to stop the sale of new diesel and gasoline cars and vans by 2030. It will require, from 2035, all new cars and vans to have zero-tailpipe emissions. The European Union \u2014 which the U.K. left on Jan. 31, 2020 \u2014 is pursuing similar targets. According to the International Energy Agency, electric vehicle sales hit 6.6 million in 2021. In the first quarter of 2022, EV sales came to 2 million, a 75% increase compared to the first three months of 2021."},

Situated roughly 89 kilometers (approximately 55 miles) off the coast of Yorkshire, England, the scale of Hornsea 2 is considerable. According to Orsted, it has a capacity of more than 1.3 gigawatts and stretches across an area of 462 square kilometers \u2014 more than half the size of New York City. Hornsea 2, it added, uses Siemens Gamesa turbines with blades measuring 81 meters, or more than 265 feet. \"One revolution of the wind turbine blades can power an average UK home for 24 hours,\" the company says. It is the latest step forward for the Hornsea 2 project, which generated its first power in Dec. 2021. The development comes as European countries attempt to wean themselves off Russian fossil fuels, including gas, following the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine in February. \"Current global events highlight more than ever the importance of landmark renewable energy projects like Hornsea 2, helping the UK increase the security and resilience of its energy supply and drive down costs for consumers by reducing dependence on expensive fossil fuels,\" said Duncan Clark, head of the U.K. region at Orsted. The U.K. is home to a mature offshore wind sector that looks set to expand in the coming years, with authorities aiming for up to 50 GW of capacity by 2030. The European Union, which the U.K. left in January 2020, has previously laid out a 300 GW target for offshore wind by the middle of this century. Across the Atlantic, the U.S. has a long way to go to catch up with Europe. America's first offshore wind facility, the 30 megawatt Block Island Wind Farm, only started commercial operations in late 2016. Change is coming, however, and in Nov. 2021 ground was broken on a project dubbed the United States' \"first commercial scale offshore wind farm.\""},

Officials do not have additional details at this time, Singhal said. \"This is one of two deaths in the United States that are currently under investigation to determine whether monkeypox was a contributing cause of death,\" Singhal told reporters during a press conference Thursday. Health officials in Texas last month reported the death of an adult in the Houston area who was diagnosed with monkeypox. The individual had a severely compromised immune system, according to health officials. Monkeypox is rarely fatal, but people with weak immune systems are at higher risk of severe disease. The virus causes a painful rash that resembles blisters or pimples. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a report published Thursday, found that 38% of 2,000 patients diagnosed with monkeypox from May to July were HIV positive. People who have monkeypox and HIV were hospitalized more often than those who did not have HIV, according to the study. The U.S. is trying to contain the largest monkeypox outbreak in the world, with more than 21,000 cases across all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, according to the CDC.

During a phone in with radio station LBC back in April, and prior to his position in new Prime Minister Liz Truss' cabinet, Rees-Mogg offered some insight into how he may look to shape policy in the months ahead. \"We need to be thinking about extracting every last cubic inch of gas from the North Sea because we want security of supply,\" he said. \"But 2050 is a long time off,\" he added, referring to the U.K.'s legally binding goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by the middle of this century. \"We're not trying to become net-zero tomorrow, and we are going to need fossil fuels in the interim, and we should use ours, that we have got available,\" Rees-Mogg said. He later doubled down on the need for fossil fuels, stating that \"we want to get oil out of the North Sea, we want to get more gas out of the North Sea.\" And on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, Rees-Mogg said, \"if we're sitting on tons of gas, that seems quite an interesting opportunity.\" Such a viewpoint stands in stark contrast to the views expressed by high-profile figures such as the U.N. Secretary General, Antonio Guterres. Back in June, Guterres slammed new funding for fossil fuel exploration, describing it as \"delusional\" and calling for an abandonment of fossil fuel finance. In his phone in with LBC, Rees-Mogg said he was \"very much in favor of going nuclear\" and \"very interested by \u2026 modular nuclear reactors.\" Offshore wind, he said, was \"providing an increasing part of our supply, and that is important, but you don't always know where the wind is going to blow, that is the problem, whereas nuclear provides baseload.\" Rees-Mogg has also appeared skeptical about the importance of acting now when it comes to rolling out renewables and tackling climate change. Speaking to ChatPolitics in 2014, for instance, he said he \"would like my constituents to have cheap energy rather more than I would like them to have windmills.\" Asked about the climate and global warming, he offered up the following take. \"I'm all in favor of long-term policy making, but I think trying to forecast the climate for a thousand years and what little steps you make now having the ability to change it is unrealistic, and I think the cost of it is probably unaffordable. You need to look at ameliorating the consequences of anything that may happen.\" Rees-Mogg's views have already prompted a barrage of criticism from environmental organizations. Dave Timms, head of political affairs at Friends of the Earth, said putting Rees-Mogg in charge of energy policy was \"deeply worrying for anyone concerned about the deepening climate emergency, solving the cost-of-living crisis and keeping our fuel bills down for good.\" Elsewhere, Greenpeace UK's head of politics, Rebecca Newsom, described Rees-Mogg as being \"the last person who should be in charge of the energy brief, at the worst possible moment.\" CNBC contacted the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy for comment, but did not receive a response ahead of this story's publication. Rees-Mogg is part of the cabinet assembled by the U.K.'s new Prime Minister, Liz Truss. Truss is assuming office at a time of significant turmoil and uncertainty in energy markets, with many European countries attempting to wean themselves off Russian fossil fuels following the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. During an interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg over the weekend, Truss provided an insight into her views on the matter. \"We, actually, as a country, rely relatively little on gas from Russia,\" she said, noting that this was not the case in Europe. It was important, she went on to argue, \"that we develop renewables, we develop nuclear, that we work with our European partners to develop alternative forms of energy.\" \"It's also very important we use the resources in the North Sea,\" Truss, who was speaking before her victory in the Conservative Party's leadership contest was announced, said. \"There's more we can do to exploit current gas fields. I support exploring fracking in parts of the United Kingdom, where that can be done.\""},

Unions are fighting for better schedules, safety and work conditions", "paragraphs": " It's not just about the money. There has been a surge in union activism \u2014 including strikes and organizing efforts \u2014 in the last year that is being driven by factors far beyond pay rates and benefits packages. If pay was the only issue, the nation probably wouldn't be facing the risk of its first in 30 years this coming week, a walkout that could knock the legs out from under the and be another . A presidential panel looking at that labor dispute recommended the two sides agree to a five-year contract that includes an immediate 14% raise, backpay from 2020, and a 24% pay increase over the course of the contract. That's less than the 31% in raises over five years the union is seeking, but more than the 17% previously offered by railroad management. That was enough to get some of the unions to agree to tentative deals, but not the unions that represent more than 90,000 workers, including those who make up the two-person crews on freight trains. They appear poised to strike unless Congress acts to keep them on the job. Those unions say they're not rejecting the wage offer. Rather, it's the proposals they object to, which require them to be on call, and ready to report to work, seven days a week for much of the year. If it were just a question of wages, a deal between the two sides would likely already be in place. \"We're not going to sit here and argue about [wages] or health care. We're beyond that,\" said Jeremy Ferguson, president of the union that represents conductors, one of the two workers on freight trains along with the engineer. The unions say conditions on the job are driving thousands of workers to quit jobs that they previously would have kept for their entire careers, creating untenable conditions for the remaining workers. Changing those work rules, including the on-call requirement, is the main demand. \"The word has gotten out these are not attractive jobs the way they treat workers,\" said Dennis Pierce, president of the union representing engineers. \"Employees have said 'I've had enough.'\" And it's not just the railroad workers who have reached this breaking point.

Alexis Petrakis, a member of the union's bargaining committee and a child therapist at Kaiser for the last three years, said she had never been in a union before and didn't expect to be going on strike this time. But she said the poor quality of care and the company's inability to schedule visits for new patients for up to six weeks because of staffing issues, have pushed her and her co-workers to walk out. \"Being away from my patients is heartbreaking. But what I go back to is they were getting inadequate care,\" Petrakis said. \"The curtain is being lifted on this broken system. It needs to change now.

It was the first successful union vote at an  facility. and the desire to in the way stores are run are major reasons why baristas at more than 200 Starbucks nationwide have in the last nine months. These noneconomic issues might seem unique to today, but they were behind the very foundation of the US labor movement a century ago. Employees fighting for safer working conditions and quality-of-life issues such as weekends off, holidays, paid vacation and a 40-hour week helped unions establish a toehold in the US and led to their growth in the first half of the 20th century. Union members aren't the only ones voicing concerns about these issues. Some economists attribute the so-called \" \" that saw a record number workers quit their jobs starting in 2021, to employees' greater focus on quality-of-life issues. And they say the pandemic brought these issues to light for many workers. Beyond the impact that had on the broader labor force, concerns about work conditions has resulted in a surge of union activism. There have been 263 strikes so far this year, according to a database kept by Cornell University, up 84% from the same period last year. And there have been 826 union elections at workplaces from January through July of this year, up 45% from the number held in the same period of 2021, according to data from the National Labor Relations Board, which oversees the votes. The 70% success rate by unions in those votes is far better than the 42% in the first seven months of 2021. Those surges in activity would never have happened without the non-economic issues coming front and center, according to union officials. \"That's definitely what's driving the voice of the workers around the country. It's not just pocketbook issues,\" said Fred Redmond, secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO. \"They want their voices heard. They're working horrendous schedules. Workers are finding out their bosses don't respect their voice, they don't respect them.\" Experts agree that the unions are finding newfound success because of worker anger about noneconomic issues. \"Unions are successful when they are building on things that workers are concerned about,\" said Alexander Colvin, dean of the school of industrial and labor relations at Cornell University. \"The scheduling, the health and safety concerns, those are very important he added. \"There's certainly an opportunity for the unions there.\" And experts say these issues are a good sign for continued union strength going forward. \"The rising of importance of the noneconomic issues ... suggests a rebirth of the labor movement,\" said Todd Vachon, a professor of labor studies at Rutgers University. \"Economic demand for labor will ebb and flow. The more encompassing the demands that labor brings to the table, the better they'll be able to weather the changes in the economic business cycle.\""},

Other studies have found that pulse oximeters -- small devices that clamp onto a finger to monitor oxygen levels in the blood -- may yield inaccurate readings among people of color. \"The finding of racial bias in one category of devices could have been an anomaly. The finding of bias in thermometers as well leads to the important question of what other medical devices or diagnostics could be failing our patients,\" Dr. Sivasubramanium Bhavani, assistant professor in the Division of Pulmonology, Allergy, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine at the Emory University School of Medicine and first author of the JAMA study, wrote in an email to CNN. The new research suggests that \"23% of fevers in Black patients could go undetected with a temporal thermometer,\" Bhavani wrote. \"If fevers are going undetected, then notifications are being missed, and these missed notification pathways could lead to delays in antibiotics and could lead to worse outcomes for Black patients,\" he added. \"In the outpatient and community setting, missed fevers could lead to delayed diagnosis, which could be especially important during surges of the pandemic. If schools, churches, and workplaces were using temporal thermometers to screen for fevers, this likely led to undetected fevers in a significant percentage of Black people.\" The researchers -- from Emory University in Atlanta and the University of Hawai\u02bbi John A. Burns School of Medicine in Honolulu -- examined the performance of in detecting fever among 2,031 Black and 2,344 White patients with infections. The patients were admitted to four Emory hospitals between 2014 and 2021. The researchers didn't have an adequate sample size to evaluate whether there was inaccuracy in temporal measurements in Asian and Hispanic patients. They found that the overall temporal temperature readings tended to be lower than the oral temperature readings in Black people but not in White people. The prevalence of fever detected in the Black patients was 10.1% with the temporal thermometer, compared with 13.2% with the oral thermometer. But among White patients, the prevalence was 10.8% with temporal and 10.2% with oral. The researchers wrote in their study that the difference in temporal versus oral thermometer readings among Black patients can lead to fevers going undetected more often -- and subsequently, an illness could be misdiagnosed or even untreated. Clinicians \"depend on accurate temperature readings. We make so many decisions based on them -- on whether to start someone on antibiotics, whether to admit them to the hospital, whether to do certain procedures or testing,\" said Dr. Tom Valley, an assistant professor in the University of Michigan's Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, who treats patients in the intensive care unit at Michigan Medicine in Ann Arbor. He was not involved in the new research. Valley has studied how pulse oximeters don't work as well in measuring oxygen levels among people of color and said he is not surprised by the racial differences in the performance of temporal thermometers. \"As someone who has been involved in this work and has found something similar in a different diagnostic tool -- pulse oximetry -- unfortunately, I'm not surprised,\" he said. \"We don't know whether these problems exist unless we look for them, and if we don't look for them, we're not going to identify these problems. If we don't identify these problems, we can't fix them, and so that's part of the issue. We don't know how far this goes. We don't know how deep this goes, this racism within healthcare.\" In theory, any medical equipment that leverages infrared sensing in how it works \"will likely show discordance in its performance across people with different skin tones,\" said Dr. Leo Anthony Celi, clinical research director and principal research scientist at the , who was not involved in the new study. That's because the technology in such devices, like pulse oximeters and temporal thermometers, involves emitting and capturing light to make a measurement. For instance, pulse oximeters send light through the finger to a sensor that uses the light to detect the color of your blood and gauge blood-oxygen levels. Temporal thermometers use infrared technology to measure the heat energy your body gives off. If a device isn't calibrated for darker skin tones, the pigmentation could affect how the light is absorbed and how infrared technology works. \"Skin tone will interfere with the reflection of light,\" said Celi, . \"We think that this is just the tip of the iceberg. I suspect that over the next year, we will have an abundance of papers showing how there are products that are in use for care that are themselves not objectively accurate across different demographics.\" These inaccuracies in how a device might perform in Black and brown patients are examples of why it's important for research to be more inclusive and involve people of color in clinical trials for the design and evaluation of medical devices, Celi said. \"It's not as simple as it sounds, though. Historically, it is more difficult to recruit people of color or underrepresented individuals to clinical trials because of the problems that we have seen in the past where they were abused,\" he said. But overall, \"it really reflects the much bigger systemic problem that we have now in the way we design, we innovate, we develop health products -- not just medical devices but also medications and interventions,\" he said. \"We really need to step up in terms of making sure that the research we perform is more inclusive so that we avoid these unintended consequences of the technology that we develop.\" The new study did not analyze the exact factors behind why these racial differences in the accuracy of temporal thermometers exist -- it just found that they did. \"The way these thermometers work is by measuring radiation emitted from a large artery in the forehead. Several factors that are not completely characterize may impact the ability to detect and accurately measure that radiation. One such factor may be skin color,\" Dr. Ashraf Fawzy, an assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine, who was not involved in the new study, wrote in an email to CNN. That could suggest that the technology behind temporal thermometers was not sufficiently tested among people with dark skin. These devices also \"depend heavily\" on the user performing the temperature measurement correctly, he said. \"It may be that users of the device are placing the thermometer in the wrong location more often on Black patients leading to inaccurate readings,\" Fawzy wrote. \"The findings are certainly surprising. Unlike pulse oximeters, it is generally well known that temporal thermometers are less accurate and reliable however I personally never considered that this inaccuracy may be different between Black and White patients.\""},

BA.4.6 is an offshoot of the BA.4 subvariant of the Omicron coronavirus variant. Only a couple of mutations separate it from its predecessor, but it is slowly gaining ground in the United States, even against BA.5, which continues to dominate transmission. BA.4.6 is now causing an estimated 7% to 10% of new Covid-19 infections, according to from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is particularly prevalent in the Midwest, where it is causing an estimated 18% of new infections. Evusheld is a combination of two long-lasting, lab-created antibodies made by AstraZeneca. When given every six months, it can prevent a Covid-19 infection in people who may not get enough protection from vaccines because their immune system can't respond effectively to them. The CDC estimates that about 7 million Americans could benefit from the protection of Evusheld. This vital therapy has been holding up well against new coronavirus variants. But in new tests, Dr. David Ho, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University, found that although this subvariant doesn't seem to bind to our cells more easily than others, it does appear to evade the ability of some antibodies to neutralize it, including those in Evusheld. \"We found that that combination antibody no longer works against this new variant, and that is the only antibody combination that's approved for prevention of Covid-19,\" Ho told CNN. Ho and his team have worked throughout the pandemic to quickly characterize new variants to help the US refine its treatment strategy. His latest research has been shared as , in advance of peer review. Ho said he has also sent his results to the National Institutes of Health and the US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA said in a statement that it \"is working with sponsors of all currently authorized therapeutics to assess the activity against any global SARS-CoV-2 variant(s) of interest and is committed to communicating with the public as we learn more.\" AstraZeneca said that the antibodies in Evusheld work together and that testing them separately may not reflect how the therapy performs in the real world. \"There is limited relevance to studies that evaluate the Evusheld component antibodies individually vs. in combination or that attempt to recreate versions of tixagevimab and cilgavimab vs authentic Evusheld. The data for the individual Evusheld antibodies are not representative of the synergistic effect of the combination as administered in the Evusheld label. Antibodies recreated in a laboratory based on publicly available information are not an accurate replication of Evusheld,\" a spokesperson said in a statement. Ho says that he did test the combination of the antibodies and that he's confident in his results. He points out that his team's conclusions echo the results of performed by scientists in China. In the meantime, Ho says, people who are immunocompromised need to know that Evusheld may not be as protective as it once was. \"Just be aware that BA.4.6 is going to be resistant, and it is gaining ground on BA.5. So folks who are immunocompromised in general should be more cautious,\" he said. Ho says that based on his research, only one monoclonal antibody -- bebtelovimab -- continues to be effective against the circulating variants. \"Now we'll be left, essentially, with one antibody,\" he says. \"Everything else is gone.\" He said the FDA has been very focused on making sure the Covid-19 vaccines are updated, but he worries that it hasn't continued to keep antibody treatments current. \"There are millions of people who have compromises to the immune system, and they would be running out of options right now,\" he said."},

These shots will replace the boosters previously offered in the US such that, for people 12 and older, being \"up-to-date\" with vaccines means having the new jab. Is the Covid-19 vaccine going to become an annual shot, like the flu vaccine? Speaking Tuesday, head of the Biden administration's Covid-19 Response Team, Dr. Ashish Jha, suggested so, telling reporters that the vaccines and boosters are likely to become  A lot of people have specific questions about whether they should get it now or wait. Who should rush out and get the booster, and who can probably wait a little longer? Is there a benefit to delaying the vaccine so that it can be timed with winter holidays? And should parents of kids under 12 worry that they aren't yet eligible? To guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of One takeaway is that the booster will be an that targets both the original strain and the Omicron subvariants. This is not unusual -- it's what's done every year for the flu vaccine, where manufacturers anticipate what will likely be the strains in circulation and then target the vaccine accordingly. Another important takeaway for me is that the CDC is moving away from counting the number of vaccine doses, and instead saying that people 12 and older are considered up to date on their coronavirus vaccines if they have received the original primary series -- two doses of Pfizer, two doses of Moderna or one dose of Johnson & Johnson -- plus this updated booster. That simplifies things a lot. From the time Covid-19 vaccines were first authorized, I and other public health experts have been saying . We didn't know whether the coronavirus vaccines would be a series of two, three or four shots, after which you're done, or whether it would need to be given on regular intervals. The hepatitis vaccine, for example, is a three-dose vaccine, versus the tetanus vaccine, which requires regular boosters. And, of course, the flu vaccine is updated every year. It's looking like the coronavirus vaccines are more like the flu vaccine. Immunity wanes after a time, and there are also new strains that may benefit from more targeted vaccines. Federal health authorities have even signaled . Such cadence will be helpful, I think, because Americans are already used to getting a flu shot every year. Especially if the Covid-19 booster can be timed together with the flu shot, that could help improve vaccine uptake for both shots. The CDC says that , as long as it's been at least two months since their last vaccine. To me, though, that doesn't mean that the urgency is the same for everyone. I think it's most urgent for people who have not received any vaccine or not had Covid-19 in 2022 to get the updated booster. This is especially true for older individuals and those who have chronic medical conditions. About have not had any booster. Those individuals really should get the updated booster now. Until this latest CDC announcement, only individuals 50 and older and those who are immunocompromised have been able to get two boosters. The uptake for that second booster has also been low, with so far among individuals 50 and older. That means there are quite a few adults who have may have had their last shot in the previous calendar year. I'd advise these individuals not to wait. If someone has not gotten any vaccine, they need to get vaccinated with the primary series first. That means getting the two doses of the original Pfizer or Moderna vaccines (or two doses of Novavax or one dose of Johnson & Johnson). People need to complete the primary series prior to receiving the updated booster. People who recently recovered from Covid-19 can wait to get the updated booster. CDC guidelines say that these individuals . I think this is sound advice. Reinfection is unlikely immediately after recovery, and also there could be benefit to allowing the body time to produce antibodies from infection. The CDC also says that people are eligible to be vaccinated with the new booster if it's been at least two months since their last vaccine. I don't think most people need to rush out to get the booster exactly at the two-month mark. Some might decide to wait three or four months so that it's a little bit later in the fall; that way, they could have better protection around the holidays. I can understand why they'd want to do this. We know that the Covid-19 shots provide maximal effectiveness against infection in the several weeks after they're given. There is sustained protection against severe illness, but the effectiveness against infection wanes somewhat over time. It's hard to predict the best timing the shots, though, because we don't know what will happen this fall and winter. Right now, the case count for Covid-19 is high in a lot of parts of the country. For some people, especially those who are more vulnerable to severe illness, it makes sense to get optimal protection now. But case counts could also increase later this fall, and some others may decide to wait until a few weeks before Thanksgiving to get their booster. In general, I'd go back to the point of last vaccine or infection. If you have not been vaccinated in 2022 and have not had a recent infection, I'd advise that you get the booster sooner rather than later. But if you recently had a booster and/or Covid-19, you could probably wait a month or so, to try to have more effectiveness against infection going into holidays. No, and I don't think the case for boosting children is nearly as clear as it is for adults. The majority of children have had Covid-19. Recovery from infection, plus vaccination, affords them a very high level of protection against severe illness. I think it's fine for parents of younger children to wait until an updated booster becomes available for this age group."},

But despite covering more than of the Earth's surface, the ocean is still a relative mystery. In fact, we know more about the than we do about the sea floor; just over of the ocean bed has been mapped. Getting a fuller picture would enable us to navigate ships more safely, create more accurate climate models, lay down telecommunication cables, build offshore windfarms and protect marine species -- all part of what's known as the \"blue economy,\" projected to be worth by 2030. Underwater robotic vehicles equipped with sensors are helping gather that data quicker and more cheaply than ever before. But many of these vehicles rely on batteries with a limited lifespan, and need to return to a boat or the shore to recharge, making it difficult for them to map more remote parts of the sea. A five-year-old startup called is rising to the challenge, founded by oceanographer Yi Chao. While working at NASA, he developed technology to power ocean robots by harnessing \"the naturally occurring temperature difference\" of the sea, Chao told CNN Business. The power module can be installed on existing data-gathering robots or Seatrec's own floating device. This dives a kilometer down to examine the chemistry and shape of the seabed, using sonar to create a map of the surrounding area. The robot returns to the surface to send back its findings via satellite. As the float moves between colder and warmer parts of the ocean, material inside the module either melts or solidifies, causing pressure that in turn creates thermal energy and powers the robot's generator. \"They get charged by the sea, so they can extend their lifetime almost indefinitely,\" Chao said. A basic float model typically costs around $20,000. Attaching Seatrec's energy system adds another $25,000, Chao said. But the access to free, renewable energy and the ability to stay in the water longer makes data gathering up to five times cheaper in the long run, according to Chao. He said the startup is making fewer than 100 devices per year, primarily for marine researchers, but the technology is easily scalable -- Seatrec's energy module can also be can be retrofitted onto existing mapping devices to extend their range. New technologies that can extend the reach of data-gathering devices are crucial for mapping more remote parts of the deep sea, according Jamie McMichael-Phillips, director of the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO . \"One of the huge challenges we have is quite simply physics,\" said McMichael-Phillips. \"Unlike mapping the Earth's surface where we can use a camera [or] satellites, at sea, light does not penetrate through the water column. So we're pretty much limited to using sonar systems.\" Launched in 2017, the Seabed 2030 Project has increased awareness about the importance of the ocean floor, and given researchers and companies a clear goal to work towards: map the entire seafloor by the end of this decade. Some companies, such as , are surveying the ocean from the surface. Another startup, Bedrock Ocean Exploration, says it can provide surveys of seabed areas up to 10 times faster than traditional methods by using an autonomous electric submarine fitted with sonars, cameras and lasers; the data is then analyzed on Bedrock's own cloud platform. Even with the growing number of technologies accelerating seabed exploration, completing the map is still a logistical and financial challenge. Chao estimates that it would take 3,000 of Seatrec's floats operating over the next 10 years to fully survey the ocean. The company has raised in seed funding to scale up production of its energy harvesting system. But this is a drop in the ocean of the capital needed to fully survey the ocean, which is estimated to be \"somewhere between $3 to $5 billion,\" according to McMichael-Phillips -- \"pretty much the same order of magnitude as the cost of sending a mission to Mars.\" Bedrock's DiMare believes it's time we start investing in our own planet. \"If we want to keep Earth as a place that humans can live,\" he said, \"we have got to get a lot smarter about what's going on in the ocean.\""},
{"url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/26/weather/tornado-facts-formation-supercell/index.html", "title": "This is how a thunderstorm produces a tornado", "paragraphs": " Tornadoes are one of Earth's most violent forces of nature. They have occurred in all 50 states and have been spotted throughout the year. While they are most common in the United States, tornadoes can occur all over the globe. While great strides have been made in the study of tornadoes, there's still so much we don't know about them. They have been studied immensely during the last few decades to learn what causes them and how they form. CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller, who is also a storm chaser, has been following and studying these storms since 2005. \"Something you learn from studying tornadoes, especially in the field, is that there is no perfect formula for forming a tornado -- every storm is unique,\" says Miller. \"Sometimes, it may appear that a storm is in a perfect environment for a tornado to form, yet it never does. Conversely, tornadoes frequently form in marginal environments where it seems like one or more 'ingredients' to storm formation is missing or lacking,\" says Miller. While there's no perfect formula as to which storms will produce tornadoes, there's commonality in the anatomy of the systems that result in tornadoes. There are even signs you can see that will help you understand the life cycle of a developing storm that could produce a tornado. As warm air rises, clouds begin to grow taller and taller. This is the developing phase of the thunderstorm. You can see fluffy white cumulus clouds grow taller with your own eyes. This is before you see rain or hear thunder. As the clouds grow, you will notice the bottom of the cloud darkening. You will many times see the very top of the cloud flattening out, creating an anvil shape that protrudes from the top of the cloud. This indicates very cold air at the top of the cloud and could be a precursor to the possibility of hail. As the storm matures, it could become what's known as a supercell. A supercell is a rotating thunderstorm. \"Nearly all supercells produce some sort of severe weather (large hail or damaging winds) but only 30 percent or less produce tornadoes,\" says the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. During this mature phase of the thunderstorm or supercell; heavy rain, lightning, hail and very strong winds are expected. Sometimes, you will feel a strong gust of wind a few moments before the rain arrives. This is called a gust front. This is caused by cool air being forced down from the storm cloud. When the cold air hits the ground, it spreads out quickly, ahead of the storm. This is a sure sign that a storm is near. Tornadoes are usually formed from supercells. These supercells develop when there are several ingredients in place to help them thrive: instability, lift and wind shear. Within the supercell, wind shear becomes a crucial component to the storms development. Shear is when winds change directions with height. This creates spin within the thunderstorm cloud. Another force that's acting inside the supercel is a downdraft. This is an area of drier air that is pushed down from the storm. As it's forced down, it wraps around the backside of the storm. The updrafts and downdrafts work in tandem to pull the horizontal column of air down to form the tornado. This vertical column of air is called a funnel cloud until it touches the ground -- at that point it becomes a tornado. \"The most telltale sign that a tornado could be forming, when you are looking at a close-range severe thunderstorm, is the 'wall cloud,'\" says Miller. The wall cloud is a lowering of the cloud base that will lead to the vortex, or spinning of air. When this rotating column of air touches the ground, a tornado has formed. The presence of a wall cloud doesn't always mean a tornado will form, but it certainly ups the odds. \"You will know you are looking at a wall cloud because it will hang noticeably lower than the rest of the thunderstorm and you may notice it is rotating if you look closely,\" says Miller. Most tornadoes are relatively small and short-lived, and can still be dangerous and cause damage. However, more violent tornadoes can be more than a mile wide and stay on the ground for more than an hour. This is because they have much more momentum than the smaller tornadoes, making them harder to stop. Miller has witnessed roughly 15-20 tornadoes during his years storm chasing. \"There is no denying that there is a certain amount of excitement that comes from seeing a tornado when you are set out with the intent of seeing one,\" says Miller. \"At the same time, you are balancing that excitement with a sizable amount of anxiety and concern over what the tornado could do, especially if there are residents in the immediate path of the storm. As someone who spent years studying, and many more years reporting on, tornadoes, it still gets all my nerves firing when you see a tornado in person.\" The smaller tornadoes have winds of 60-110 mph, while the more violent tornadoes can have winds from 160 to more than 200 miles per hour. The strongest winds ever recorded on Earth were from a tornado, on at more than  CNN's Jackson Dill and CNN meteorologist Haley Brink contributed to this report"},

Is it quickest to get the train or the bus? What about a taxi or a city bike? Which provider has the nearest e-scooter? It can be inconvenient and time consuming. Which is why Finnish startup MaaS Global decided to aggregate all these services into one app called Whim. Available in more than 10 cities across Europe and Asia, users can access taxis, buses, bikes, e-scooters and rental cars. \"Whim's sole purpose is to compete against car ownership,\" CEO Sampo Hietanen tells CNN Business. According to the International Energy Agency, transport is responsible for , most of which come from . If Whim can persuade users to trade their car keys for a single app offering multiple transport options, the environmental impact could be enormous, says Hietanen. He admits this isn't an easy task. To succeed Whim has to be more convenient and cheaper than owning a car. \"The car represents freedom of mobility,\" says Hietanen \u2014 even if a city dweller barely uses it, they still keep it parked outside as a \"freedom insurance.\" To compete, Whim offers rental cars and taxis, but Hietanen says that users tend to opt for public transport or micromobility (shared lightweight vehicles such as bikes or e-scooters). Users can choose between multiple tiers of service, including a pay-as-you-go option and a 30-day season ticket, which costs \u20ac62 ($73) in Helsinki \u2014 where the app is most established \u2014 for unlimited public transport and short taxi rides. The ticket also offers car rental from \u20ac55 ($65) per day. While Helsinki has well-developed alternatives to driving, that's not true of everywhere. If a city \"does not have a wide public transport system or a lot of rental cars or taxis in place\" then it will be difficult to convince people to give up their cars, says Maria Kamargianni, associate professor of transport and energy at University College London. She says apps like Whim represent the first step in tempting people away from car ownership, and adds that the availability of alternative transport options is likely to improve as the market matures.

It's available in several European cities and in Tokyo, and has racked up 18 million trips globally since launch. But the business has been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, says Hietanen; with fewer people traveling, revenues are lower, stalling the company's expansion into other cities. Finnish newspaper recently reported that the company had spent \u20ac50 million ($59 million) on failed expansion ventures. Hietanen says the money was spent on integrating multiple transportation providers, establishing market readiness in several countries, and developing the complex technology that underpins the app. \"We've known from the beginning that the investment needed to create this would be substantial,\" he says, adding that the company has recently secured further investment. Though the industry is in its infancy, Hietanen is confident the demand will be there. A from the International Transport Forum (ITF) says that mobility services will be vital in meeting the needs of a growing world population and fast-paced urbanization. But for growth to happen, \"people must choose it over other travel options\" such as private motor vehicles. This is already happening, says Hietanen. According to a company survey carried out in Helsinki, 12% of its users said that Whim had prompted them to give up their cars. \"People want the more sustainable solution,\" he says, \"but they still want the freedom of being able to go anywhere, anytime.\""},

But have you ever noticed hurricane hunters' flight patterns shown by meteorologists on TV look like random, odd shapes? Those flight patterns may look like boxes or stars, but they serve specific purposes for each individual storm. Hurricane hunters don't fly away from these storms like commercial airlines do. They fly directly into them, but they don't just fly into and around the storms randomly. There is a method to the madness. There are two distinctive groups of hurricane hunters, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the US Air Force Reserve (USAF). Both organizations fly missions into tropical disturbances in order to record invaluable data used by forecasters at the National Hurricane Center (NHC). For the Hurricane Hunters, there are two main types of missions flown, fixed and invest. Fixed missions are designated for systems that meet tropical cyclone qualifications, such as tropical depressions, tropical storms, and hurricanes. The main objective is to mark the center of circulation, monitor winds speeds and pressure changes, and other variables that are tricky for satellites in space to measure in full detail. For fixed missions, 'Alpha' is most common flight pattern used to collect data in a tropical cyclone. \"The Alpha pattern is the standard profile we fly for fix missions so it's the one people are most familiar with seeing from us,\" , meteorologist and aerial reconnaissance weather officer with the Air Force Reserve's , said. \"The pattern consists of two legs flown at intercardinal directions, and when complete, looks a lot like the Greek Alpha symbol when including the crossleg.\" Cardinal directions are the standard points on a compass: north, south, east, and west. Intercardinal directions are the diagonal points in between: northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest. Interestingly, the bigger, stronger storms tend to be the \"easier\" ones to fly in. \"From my perspective as the onboard meteorologist, the Alpha pattern is the \"easiest\" to fly. Because we normally fly those on stronger storms, there's not a lot of question where the storm center is,\" DeHart said. \"The flights can be rough of course, but at the end of the day we just go fly through the storm center, collect the data, and send it to NHC.\" The primary objective of an invest mission is to determine if a system meets the definition of a tropical cyclone; storms that do not yet have a name or any real tropical structure characteristics. For invest missions, the NHC will often send estimated coordinates of where they believe the center of circulation is, which is where the missions will target for their starting point. However, invest missions by nature have to be a bit more flexible for flight patterns, simply because there are so many unknowns with these types of storms. \"We never know what we're going to find, yet we always have to be thinking two or three steps ahead. So that really makes us need to think about the meteorology [in each particular storm],\" DeHart said. \"Is it a closed low or an open wave? Maybe it's closed but just elongated? Is it battling shear? Are there several smaller swirls competing to be the main circulation center? Weak storms and invests can be very tricky and require a lot of thinking on our toes.\" Air Force Hurricane Hunters have a to choose from for invest missions: X, Delta, and Box, just to name a few. DeHart explains the missions are ideal for the weaker, more uncertain storms. While the X pattern may resemble the Alpha pattern, it is flown at much lower altitudes, usually around 500 to 1,000 feet. \"Once a system becomes a tropical storm or hurricane, the hurricane hunters begin flying at higher altitudes, ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 feet depending on the severity of the storm,\" said Jessica Kendziorek, public affairs operations chief with the USAF 403rd Wing. Flight levels for the Delta and Box patterns are usually at or below 5,000 ft absolute altitude. \"The Delta and Box patterns are similar in that we'll fly around the periphery of the forecast center seeing if we can observe winds in all four quadrants of the storm that would indicate a closed circulation. If we find a closed circulation, we can confidently go [find] the center; if not, we'll continue the mission in 'invest mode',\" DeHart said. NOAA Hurricane Hunters also fly operational fixed and invest missions (though the names may be different), but they usually have more research-oriented objectives. They fly many unique , with different types of aircraft, depending on what type of mission is assigned. Hurricane Hunters also fly a third type of mission, which the Air Force rarely flies, according to DeHart, called synoptic missions. For fixed missions NOAA often flies a Figure 4, Rotated Figure 4 pattern, or a Butterfly pattern. \"The Butterfly and Figure 4 patterns flown by the WP-3D through the storm are typically the ones used to [find] the center of circulation,\" said Jonathan Shannon, public affairs specialist for the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center Office of Marine and Aviation Operations. The Rotated Figure 4 pattern is as it sounds; the Figure 4 pattern turned on side. \"The goal with every flight is to gather data all around the center of the storm, and those patterns allow us to efficiently fly through a storm's various quadrants,\" Nick Underwood, NOAA Hurricane Hunter, said. \"This data helps with predicting a storm's intensity, as well as determining exactly where the center is.\" For invest missions, the Lawnmower and Square Spiral patterns are flown, to determine if there are actual tropical characteristics associated with the area in which they are investigating. \"The Lawnmower Pattern allows us to map out a large area when we don't have a center to aim for,\" Paul Flaherty, science branch chief at NOAA's Aircraft Operations Center, said. \"Once we are able to map a full circulation (usually by finding a west wind), we'll shift back to Figure 4's based on that newly identified center position.\" The Square Spiral pattern is a survey mission meant to supply observations on the structure and characteristics including information about the vortex center, if it exists. There is a unique third type of mission flight pattern, often used to sample the surrounding atmosphere which helps forecasters know the direction the storm is likely to go. The Star 1 pattern focuses on a scan of the outer edges of the system. The closely-related Star 2 pattern also does an outer scan of the system, while also adding in a circumference loop near the center of circulation. Recently, NOAA's Gulfstream IV flew a Star-2 pattern around Hurricane Larry, to investigate outflow patterns from the storm and better determine where the storm was headed. \"The flight pattern you'll typically see from our Gulfstream IV is a circumnavigation of the storm itself, as well as sampling of the atmosphere around and ahead of the storm,\" Underwood said. \"This data helps with predicting the storm's track.\" Regardless of which entity is flying, the operational missions are the backbone for the National Hurricane Center, tasked with providing essential life-saving information about a storm. The NHC takes the data and uses it to issue guidance and advisories to the public, so people know whether Elsa or Ida or Nicholas are still tropical storms or have become hurricanes. We ended 2020 with a 30 named storms in the Atlantic basin and if this season is anything like last year, we have a long way to go."},
{"url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/06/business/california-emissions-regulations/index.html", "title": "How California ended up in the zero-emissions driver's seat", "paragraphs": " California's powerful Air Resources Board recently passed new regulations that essentially require all vehicles sold in the state to be electric, hydrogen-fueled or at least plug-in hybrid by the year 2035. What's more, 17 other states have agreed to follow California's lead, at least to some degree, in matters relating to air pollution, so many of those states could also adopt these requirements. A core part of federal emissions regulations since the early 1970s has been the so-called California Waiver. California, alone among all 50 US states, has the right to set its own auto emissions regulations. No other state can do that, but other states can, if they wish, choose to follow California's emission standards instead of less stringent federal standards. The states that have followed California's lead on emission standards tend to be more densely populated ones like New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts. But Nevada and New Mexico have also adopted them. Together these states account for well over a third of auto sales in the United States and about 40% of its population. It's not clear that all these states will, like California, ban sales of cars without charging ports or hydrogen tanks after 2035 but, if even some do, that could represent a large portion of the country. It may seem strange that one state -- California -- has so much power to set its own climate and emissions policies, and even to have sway over other states. The reasons for this go back over 50 years. The core reason is that California has long had air quality issues for a number of reasons. \"They had so many cars and they've got those damn mountains,\" said Richard Lazarus, a professor who teaches environmental law at Harvard University. Besides its sprawling urban and suburban areas that encourage driving and its mountain ranges that trap air -- and pollution -- parts of California also have lots of sunshine that stimulate chemical reactions that worsen pollution. \"I'm third generation Angelino, and I remember growing up as a kid when the skies were just... you could barely see across the street,\" said Allan Marks, a Los Angeles attorney whose work involves renewable energy and transportation. The histories of the California Air Resources Board and the Environmental Protection Agency, the federal agency that regulates emissions, hinge on two people you might not think of as being on the environmentalist vanguard, Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon. Both are, today, remembered as stalwart conservative Republicans and, in modern America, that often means being against environmental regulation. But, in 1967, it was Reagan, then the governor of California, who signed off on the creation of the California Air Resources Board. The new agency was created by joining together California's Bureau of Air Sanitation and the California Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Board. By this time, California had already enacted the nation's first tailpipe emissions regulations. These first regulations of car emissions prompted a push for federal standards to preempt other individual states from following suit, said Lazarus. The fear was that there might eventually be as many as 50 different emissions standards and that a federal standard, the Clean Air Act of 1970, was preferable. \"There were federal acts before the Clean Air Act, going back into the fifties, that were looking at air quality,\" said Marks. \"But a lot of what the federal government was doing was just studying the problem.\" In 1970 President Richard Nixon also created the Environmental Protection Agency, which studies and regulates pollution of all sorts, combining work that had, until then, been done by a variety of different federal agencies. The EPA oversees and applies the Clean Air Act. \"The great question of '70s is, 'Shall we surrender to our surroundings or shall we make our peace with nature and begin to make reparations for the damage we have done to our air, to our land, and to our water?'\" Nixon said in his State of the Union Address that year. By this time, the groundwork had already been laid for California to set its own rules and that continued with the \"California waiver,\" a part of federal regulations that made this special exception for California. It has been renewed many times since and, usually, without much fuss. EPA administrators are required to have compelling reasons to deny the waiver, said Lazurus, and there have been attempts, but none have been successful in the long term. The California wavier might have been a little awkward, but it prevented what was seen as potential chaos. At worst automakers would have to comply with two sets of rules but at least not three, four or even more different sets of rules. At the time, environmental concerns didn't cut across clear party lines, said Lazarus. There were Republicans as well as Democrats pushing for cleaner air and water. Nixon's actions, to some degree, were designed to head off at the pass a perceived political threat from environmentalists, according to Lazarus, though he later changed course and fought some environmental regulation. Another part of the Clean Air Act, passed in 1977, allows other states, if their air quality fails to meet federal standards, to follow California's stricter emissions rules as a way of improving their air quality. (They're not allowed to just create their own stricter rules.) So far, 17 other states have chosen to abide by California's emissions standard, at least in some part. In total, they represent more than 35% of all new auto sales in America. The auto industry has been able work well within the current system, said Marks. It has provided the stability originally sought with the creation of the Clean Air Act and the California waiver. \"Manufacturers work very collaboratively with California, trying to figure out how to meet the standards, what the standards should be,\" he said. During his tenure, President Donald Trump asked the courts to do away with the California waiver. That attempt failed or, at least, hadn't succeeded by the time Trump was turned out of office in the 2020 election. President Joseph Biden's administration dropped that effort and, in March 2022, the"},

But unlike other automakers who are going all-in on EVs, Toyota said it's still not convinced that's the best path forward. The world's largest automaker in terms of vehicles sold,  has in building fully battery powered EVs, despite its history of being a leader in hybrid gas/electric vehicles more than 20 years. Rivals such as  ,  and  have far more , as well as a significant number of EVs under development. Toyota has been investing more than other automakers in efforts to develop electric vehicles powered by on-board hydrogen . The fuel cells only emissions would be water vapor, which complies with tougher environmental regulations now being put in place, such as the rules announced by California last week that would by 2035. Toyota's statement on the new battery plant investment suggested it is still looking at ways to meet tougher emission rules without depending solely on battery-powered EVs. \"Toyota believes that there is more than one option for achieving carbon neutrality. It also believes that the means of reducing CO2 emissions as much as possible and as quickly as possible while protecting the livelihoods of its customers vary greatly depending on the country and region,\" Toyota said in its statement. \"With such in mind, Toyota will continue to make every effort to flexibly meet the needs of its various customers in all countries and regions by offering multiple powertrains and providing as many options as possible.\" Unlike battery-powered EVs that can be charged at homes or at an , fuel-cell powered vehicles need a whole new fueling infrastructure that would allow them to be filled with hydrogen. And those filling options are still very limited, especially outside California. Toyota's only pure battery-powered EV offered in North America is the , which went on sale earlier this year. But Toyota recently had to advise its handful of early buyers to not drive the cars due to a . The company has yet to come up with a way to fix the problem, and thus has been forced to offer to from purchasers. About half the money Toyota said it plans to spend on EV battery production will go to expanding a plant in Liberty, NC, that is already under construction. The investment will raise the price tag on the plant from $1.3 billion to $3.8 billion. The influx of cash will also increase the number of jobs at the plant, which is due to start production in 2025, by as many as 2,100. Toyota said the plant will make batteries for both pure battery-powered EVs as well as plug-in hybrid vehicles that will have both electric motors and internal combustion engines. It is important that Toyota increase some of its US-made EV battery capacity. Recently passed for EV buyers includes limits based on where the batteries are made. That requirement calls for 50% of battery components to be manufactured or assembled in North America starting in 2023 and 60% in 2024 and 2025 for a vehicle to be eligible for the tax credit. That number will gradually grow to 100% in 2029. So shipping batteries from Asia to US assembly plants could deprive the cars' potential buyers of thousands of dollars in tax credits. Automakers having been rushing to announce EV battery plant plans in recent months, often with various partners. Just this week,  announced a with LG on a new US battery plant. In addition, that it's building a battery plant in Georgia. it would invest $11.4 billion with LG rival SK Innovations to built three battery plants along with an EV assembly plant. Mercedes-Benz a battery plant in Alabama earlier this year. Stellantis, which was formed by the merger of Fiat Chrysler and French automaker PSA group, with LG. And GM and LG have built plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Michigan for a total of $7.2 billion, and are looking at a fourth plant in Indiana.

Ambani, 65, set out his succession plan on Monday, telling shareholders in his Reliance Industries conglomerate that his three children are \"first among equals\" and are being \"mentored on a daily basis by our senior leaders, including myself.\" Ambani, the chairman and promoter of Reliance Industries, has a daughter Isha, and two sons, Anant and Akash. According to the company's latest filing with the Mumbai stock exchange, \"the promoter and promoter group\" \u2014 which includes Ambani's wife and children as well as several associated companies \u2014 control nearly \"Our next-gen leaders are confidently taking over the reins across businesses,\" Asia's second richest man said at the meeting. While Ambani inherited an oil business from his father two decades ago, he has spent the last few years diversifying into tech, and retail. He launched as a mobile network in 2016. Since then it has amassed over 400 million users and launched a streaming service, a fiber broadband network, a video conferencing app and digital payments. Reliance Industries is now worth 17.8 trillion rupees ($224 billion), based on its stock market value. \"Akash and Isha have assumed leadership roles in Jio and Retail respectively. They have been passionately involved in our consumer businesses since inception,\" Ambani said. \"Anant has also joined our New Energy business with great zeal.\" Reliance Retail, which was launched in 2006, is India's top retailer by revenue and has over 15,000 stores across the country.

The tycoon said Monday that he isn't retiring yet, and will \"continue to provide hands-on leadership.\" While there has been a lot of speculation in India media about who will inherit Ambani's empire, this is the first time he has made an official statement on the roles his children will play during the transition. Ambani's father, Dhirubhai, died in 2002 without a will. His death sparked a bitter feud between Ambani and his younger brother, Anil, for control of the empire. Mukesh Ambani ultimately took over the company's main oil and petrochemicals assets, while his brother assumed control of the newer ventures, including telecom and digital businesses. The brothers' fortunes have gone in vastly different directions since then. Anil, once a billionaire, is no longer part of the elite club, according to the Bloomberg index, and his older brother in his demise. Mukesh stunned India with the Jio launch, offering customers six months of free high-speed internet. The move triggered a brutal price war, forcing some companies to quit the market altogether, including Anil's Reliance Communications. On Monday, Ambani told shareholders that Jio will invest $25 billion to roll out 5G services across India. \"5G cannot remain an exclusive service, available only to the privileged few, or only to those in our largest cities,\" he said. \"Within the next two months, by Diwali, we will launch Jio 5G across multiple key cities, including the metropolises of Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai,\" he said, referring to the Hindu festival in October.

When Ambani launched Jio, India had fewer than 350 million internet users. Now, it has over 750 million. \"We are committed to make India the largest data-powered economy in the world, beating China and the United States,\" Ambani said. On energy, Ambani said that \"Reliance aspires to make India a world leader in new energy manufacturing and a credible alternative to China,\" and plans to invest nearly $10 billion into clean energy manufacturing."},

His plans went awry", "paragraphs": " As Covid-19 wreaked havoc around the world last year, the 39-year-old son of an Indian billionaire was laying the groundwork for a plan he hoped would eventually end the pandemic. Adar Poonawalla \u2014 the CEO of Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest vaccine maker \u2014 pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into his Indian manufacturing facility and committed to make millions of doses of a then-unproven coronavirus vaccine. That vaccine, created by Oxford University and  , was still in clinical trials at the time. Nobody was sure how long a vaccine would take to develop, let alone whether it would even work. \"It was a calculated risk,\" Poonawalla told CNN Business. \"But I didn't see the choice at that time, to be honest. I just felt I'd regret not committing one way or another.\" To make his plan work, Poonawalla first had to raise nearly $1 billion. And the lives of hundreds of millions of the planet's most vulnerable people were at stake, since SII had pledged to provide poorer countries with jabs. If the gamble paid off, Poonawalla would save countless lives and be hailed as a hero during a period of historic turmoil. His fabulously rich family also would stand to grow even more wealthy by profiting from a significant deal. As the world gave its money \u2014 and trust \u2014 to Poonawalla, things seemed to be going according to plan. The AstraZeneca vaccine received approval from UK regulators in December 2020, and Poonawalla became a household name in India. But soon it became evident how badly Poonawalla had miscalculated the challenges that come with distributing millions of vaccines in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic. His company's ability to inoculate even his own countrymen was thrown into doubt earlier this year as a devastating wave of coronavirus hit India. He's also failed to keep up with his commitment to deliver shots to other nations \u2014 the consequences of which have dented his reputation and shed light on the perils of such heavy reliance on one manufacturer. It's easy to see why some of the biggest names in public health chose to rely on Poonawalla. Few manufacturers can come close to the scale at which SII is able to produce vaccines. The company \u2014 which was founded by Poonawalla's father, Cyrus, 55 years ago \u2014 produces 1.5 billion vaccines each year for measles, rubella, tetanus and many other diseases. The jabs are mainly distributed to low-income countries worldwide, including India. Poonawalla estimates that just over 50% of the world's babies depend on vaccines made at SII. The Poonawalla family charted an unusual path to becoming one of the world's preeminent vaccine makers. They have bred and raced thoroughbred horses since the 1940s, diversifying into pharmaceuticals, finance and real estate over the last half-century. Cyrus Poonawalla is now India's seventh-richest man, worth more than $16 billion, according to the His son Adar took over as CEO in 2011 and has focused on expanding in . To prepare for the AstraZeneca vaccine production, Poonawalla said he spent $800 million on buying chemicals, glass vials and other raw materials, as well as ramping up manufacturing capacity at his plant in the Western Indian city of Pune. More than $250 million came from the company's own funds. Another $300 million came from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which SII with to provide discounted or free doses to low-income countries. The rest was paid by other countries once SII started accepting orders for vaccines. In total, SII agreed to make up to 200 million vaccine doses for as many as 92 countries, as part of its deal with the Gates Foundation and Gavi, a vaccine alliance. All of that happened, though, before regulators signed off on the AstraZeneca vaccine. Had trials for that vaccine been unsuccessful, SII would \"just be making batches and then end up throwing them away,\" Poonawalla said. A business studies graduate of London's University of Westminster, Poonawalla said SII was able to make that decision more swiftly than many other companies, since it is a family-run business. \"The flexibility of being able to decide on the spot very quickly was really the main game-changer that enabled us to be able to do this,\" said Poonawalla, whose office in India is a refurbished . After the vaccine, Poonawalla began supplying doses to Indians and other other countries. By May, Gavi had received some 30 million jabs from SII. But Poonawalla's plans soon went awry when a second wave of Covid-19 hit India in the spring. At its peak the country was reporting over per day, though say the actual number was likely much higher. At that point, only percent of India's 1.3 billion population was fully vaccinated, and the country's national government had been slow in placing orders for more vaccines. Without a massive stockpile, states in India began to run out of the limited number of jabs they had. India then decided to the export of all vaccines, preventing SII from keeping up with its commitments elsewhere. \"I've always been a patriot for my country ... and if my country needs my facility first, I have to do what they say,\" Poonawalla said. \"There was no two ways about that.\" The inability to export vaccines hurt some of the poorest nations in the world. The director of Africa's disease control body, for example, warned India's hold on exports could be \" \" for the continent. People in several countries, from neighboring Nepal to , were left stranded after receiving the first dose of Covishield, the name of the India-manufactured vaccine. When asked why the global vaccine alliance chose to rely so heavily on one manufacturer, a Gavi spokesperson told CNN Business it had few options. At the start of 2021, \"very few vaccines were approved and available for deployment,\" the spokesperson said, adding that it was \"natural\" that SII would be contracted for early doses given its size. But public health expert Jeffrey Lazarus said there were flaws in the plan. \"Relying on one manufacturer was a mistake, which is easier to see in hindsight,\" said Lazarus, who heads the health systems research group at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health. While Poonawalla cannot be held responsible for some of the issues that led to the vaccine rollout stalling \u2014 chief among them, India's massive outbreak \u2014 his detractors have questioned parts of his approach. They point out Poonawalla hasn't delivered the number of jabs he initially promised, and they claim he hasn't been transparent about how he's been using all of the money he raised for the big vaccine push. \"There isn't much accountability for where the money he raised went,\" Malini Aisola, co-convenor of health sector watchdog All India Drug Action Network, told CNN Business. In June last year, it would make one billion doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine for low and middle income countries, with 400 million doses ready by the end of 2020. But by January 2021, the company had a stockpile of just . His critics weren't impressed, given the amount of capital he raised last year. The global media coverage also turned , with linking the global shortfall in vaccines to SII's problems, including the India export ban and a fire at the company's Pune facility. At the time Poonawalla said the fire had on Covishield production. But he has since saying that the incident has played a major role in hampering manufacturing. He also insists he was realistic about his goals. \"We always underpromise,\" Poonawalla told CNN Business, when asked whether the company pledged more than it could deliver. Still, he's been dogged by other controversies that have dented his reputation. As India's Covid-19 cases were skyrocketing in April, Poonawalla lowered the price of his vaccine and referred to the move as a \" \" \u2014 leading to heavy criticism, with activists pointing out that even a small profit is still a profit for SII. \"AstraZeneca has pledged that it won't from low income and middle income countries during the pandemic, but that does not seem to apply to SII,\" Aisola said. According to AstraZeneca, the companies the drugmaker has sublicensing agreements with, including SII, dictate their own prices. SII declined to comment on how much it has profited from the vaccine efforts so far, but Poonawalla said it is a \"very unreasonable and naive way of looking at the world\" for people to expect companies not to profit from the vaccine. While Poonawalla has yet to match his lofty goals, there is a chance that he and SII can get back on track, which is critical to ending vaccine inequality worldwide. India has decided to begin exporting vaccines once again as its own rate of inoculation increases. The nation had administered doses by October \u2014 about 90% of which came from SII, according to the company. SII also says that it has increased its production to 220 million doses a month as of October. SII is also expanding its partnerships, having signed a deal with American biotech firm Novavax to manufacture its Covid-19 vaccine, which is awaiting regulatory approvals. It's also partnering with the Russian Direct Investment Fund on production of the Sputnik vaccine."},

This time to $15,000, making it an unusually expensive option for a car. \"After wide release of FSD Beta 10.69.2, price of FSD will rise to $15k in North America on September 5,\" Musk last month. The release of the new software version was delayed on Monday until \"probably end of week. Needs a bit more polish,\" Musk , but the price increase took effect. Some Tesla owners who paid far less for an earlier, unfinished version of the same \"full self-driving\" software that now retails for $15,000 caution that the new price does not make sense for most buyers. CNN Business spoke with 13 people who have cars with the \"full self-driving\" beta and the overwhelming majority, 11 people, said they felt it wasn't worth $15,000. These drivers say the software has improved, but not enough to warrant the price. They describe at times having to pay more attention while using \"full self-driving\" than when driving on their own, as the car can be unpredictable. More than 100,000 Tesla vehicles have been sold with the feature. Tesla buyers can purchase \"full self-driving\" outright when they buy their car, or they may opt to pay a monthly subscription fee to use the feature. Many of the Tesla drivers who spoke with CNN Business suggested that, were they in the market today for a Tesla, they would opt for the monthly subscription fee for \"full self-driving,\" which still costs $199 a month or purchase for the more affordable Enhanced Autopilot, which combines features like automated parking and automated lane changes on highways, but isn't so clearly an unfinished, imperfect product. Three people told CNN Business that they feel that \"full self-driving\" is worth the high price to them because they personally relish testing new technologies and are excited about the promise of what \"full self-driving\" might eventually become. \"I really admire the optimism of all these people,\" Brian Moody, executive editor of the online car marketplace AutoTrader.com, said of those who believe \"full self-driving\" may soon handle all driving responsibilities despite years of delays. \"I wish I could be that way.\" Moody told CNN Business that \"full self-driving\" is especially expensive compared to other available driver-assist packages like GM's SuperCruise and Nissan ProPilot Assist. SuperCruise generally costs about $2,500 -- plus a monthly $25 connectivity fee after the third year -- and ProPilot Assist can be under $2,000 in some cases. The promised functionality of these driver-assist packages is more modest. While they steer and keep up with traffic on some highways, Musk says that \"full self-driving\" will someday allow Tesla owners to that do not need a human behind the wheel. It's not unheard of for options to reach the $10,000 threshold, but such high-priced options typically include a range of add-ons like an adaptive suspension, engine upgrade and adaptive headlights, he said. Moody said he expects consumers to pay for the monthly subscription of \"full self-driving\" rather than pay $15,000 for the promise of the feature's future potential. Four years ago, Wisam Al-Rawi bought a Tesla equipped with the driver-assist software the company calls \"full self-driving.\" He says he was happy to pay a $2,500 premium for \"full self-driving\" in anticipation that his Tesla would one day drive itself. But last month Al-Rawi, frustrated by the software's flaws, had enough. He asked Tesla to remove it. Now the California resident is surprised to see that Tesla is raising the price of \"full self-driving\" to $15,000 even as it falls short of the automaker's projections. \"I would never even pay $10,000 for it,\" Al-Rawi told CNN Business. \"They overpromised like crazy.\" But Tesla feels that the feature, which the company says remains in testing (or \"beta\") despite its wide release, will be worth much more than even the price it's selling for now. \"The FSD price will continue to rise as the software gets closer to full self-driving capability with regulatory approval,\" Musk on Twitter in 2020. \"[At] that point, the value of FSD is probably somewhere in excess of $100,000.\" But \"full self-driving\" wasn't close to what Al-Rawi heard from Musk, who has claimed every year from 2015 to 2022 that self-driving Teslas were probably a year or two away. Al-Rawi said it was stressful to use the \"full self-driving\" beta because the software would sometimes try to hit curbs or drive on the wrong side of the road. His car would brake unexpectedly at times, triggering road rage from others. \"He promised your car can be a taxi. This is going to be generating income,\" Al-Rawi said. \"Unfortunately, none of this happened.\" Al-Rawi still believes that Tesla's driver-assist features are better than any other automaker. He calls the automaker's lane-keeping feature \"fantastic.\" The \"full self-driving\" feature, which navigates local roads with steering, braking and acceleration, is where Al-Rawi had problems. Al-Rawi is far from the only one to be concerned about Teslas and unexpected braking. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which regulates motor vehicles, launched an investigation in February following hundreds of complaints of unexpected braking. But the limitations of \"full self-driving\" haven't led many Tesla owners to regret their purchase. \"There's nothing in FSD that's actually that useful, certainly not for this kind of money,\" Logan Rossignol, a Tesla \"full self-driving\" beta tester, told CNN Business. \"You're still paying for a promise. And what's that's worth to you is up to you.\" Rossignol feels the investment was worth it for him because he is a software developer and enjoys experimenting with technology. \"Full self-driving\" changes regularly due to over-the-air software updates. Drivers wake up some mornings with a new version of the technology to test and play with. Sunny Gulati, who said he paid $8,000 for \"full self-driving,\" says he feels an \"inherent joy\" from watching his Tesla try to navigate roads. He said he no longer envies other cars on the road. The system doesn't have to be perfect for him to love it. He justified the purchase of \"full self-driving\" in part because he thought it could one day make having a second car unnecessary. Gulati said that he wouldn't have been able to afford $15,000 for \"full self-driving,\" and would opt for the monthly subscription fee if purchasing today. Don Burke bought his Model S in 2019 because he wanted a vehicle that might one day drive itself. The Virginia resident said he has a form of muscular dystrophy. His legs are weakening. He will be in a wheelchair in a few years. Burke spoke with CNN Business during a multi-month road trip around the United States. He's driving as much as 600 miles a day and says that Tesla's driver-assist technology makes him a much safer driver. He said he feels humans are terrible drivers, pointing to the many deaths on roads today, and believes machines will be better. Burke said that if he was in the market again for a Tesla, the $15,000 price for \"full self-driving\" would be worth it to him. \"I love being able to be mobile,\" Burke said. \"I desperately want a machine that I can own that can drive me to where I need to be when I get in a wheelchair.\""},

Now, Asia's third largest economy is ready for the next big frontier in tech: Coming up with a new generation of software companies like Zoom or Slack. The Covid-19 pandemic has forced business around the world to make huge investments in digital infrastructure, furthering the influence of companies providing software-as-a-service, or SaaS. Businesses spent an extra $15 billion per week last year on tech as they scrambled to create safe remote working environments, . SaaS companies provide web-based applications that take care of everything from how secure the software is to how well it performs. Some of the world's most well-known SaaS companies include  , SAP Concur and  , the American behemoth that owns . India's software-as-a-service industry could be worth $1 trillion in value by 2030 and create nearly half a million new jobs, according to a compiled by consulting firm McKinsey & Co. and SaaSBoomi, a community of industry leaders. There are nearly a thousand such companies in India, of which 10 are unicorns, or startups worth at least $1 billion, the report said. \"This can be as big an opportunity as the IT services industry was in the 90s,\" said Girish Mathrubootham, CEO of Freshworks, India's best-known SaaS company. It filed for an last month, joining a string of other unicorns that are going public this year. Freshworks was founded more than a decade ago in the southern Indian city of Chennai. Like Salesforce, it provides software to help companies manage relations with their customers. It's also India's oldest unicorn in the sector, having raised funds from investors such as Tiger Global and Accel, and has more than 50,000 customers. The company was last valued at $3.5 billion in a 2019 funding round, according to data firm Tracxn. Other Indian SaaS firms have found traction by focusing on niche businesses. , for example, is a unicorn that builds software for the spa and beauty salon industry. Of India's 10 SaaS unicorns, six reached that milestone in 2020, and investors around the world are paying attention. Last year, investors pumped $1.5 billion into Indian SaaS companies, four times more than in 2018 or 2019, according to the SaaSBoomi report. Investors are excited about SaaS because of the \"massive adoption\" of software over the last decade, according to Mohit Bhatnagar, managing director of Sequoia Capital India. While India is a in the global SaaS market, investors say the country could eventually dominate the sector because of two things: its vast pool of English-speaking developers, and the relatively low cost of hiring them. Thanks to the rise of India's IT industry, software engineering has become one of the most in the country. \"India actually has one of the largest developer communities in the world,\" Bhatnagar told CNN Business. Many of them have worked at some of the biggest global tech companies. Abhinav Asthana, the co-founder of Postman, pointed to his experience working as an intern at Yahoo in Bengaluru as instrumental in the decision to build his product. He came up with the idea to build a tool that would simplify the API (Application Programming Interface) testing process. An API is a programming code that defines how two applications communicate with each other, and Postman says it has made it easier for engineers to work together as they design and build their APIs. \"We saw how software was created at these global companies, and we saw API was a key problem,\" Asthana told CNN Business. Now, Postman is India's most valuable SaaS unicorn, with a valuation of $5.6 billion. The low cost of operating in India is a big plus. According to a report by  , the salary of entry-level developers in India is 85% less than their counterparts in the United States. \"If you are building a SaaS company in the US, it is better to have a million-dollar client rather than a $10,000-client because you need to pay for sales and marketing in that country,\" said Prasanna Krishnamoorthy, managing partner at SaaS accelerator Upekkha. \"When you are serving customers from India, you can have these small and mid-sized companies, as well as large ones.\" Most SaaS companies focus on global clients, similar to the strategy that was followed by India's IT giants such as TCS and  . Investors see this as a welcome change, since most of India's oldest unicorns \u2014 from Flipkart to Paytm \u2014 have focused primarily on the domestic market. Almost 98% of Fortune 500 companies use Postman's products, according to Asthana, while Freshworks' first client was based in Australia. SaaS firms are much better placed to go global than e-commerce companies like India's Flipkart, for example. They write software once, and then are able to use it multiple times. \"For a Flipkart you need billions of dollars [to grow internationally], but for a Freshwork you need much less capital to go global,\" said Mathrubootham, who is also an investor in Postman. This is because e-commerce firms require a ton of money to set up physical operations elsewhere \u2014 they have to hire delivery drivers, rent warehouses and buy inventory. Bhatnagar of Sequoia Capital said that Indian software entrepreneurs \"mastered\" the art of \"remote sales\" fairly early. \"Honestly, in this last two years, the whole world has had to understand how to do better remote sales,\" he added. Despite the euphoria, there are some hurdles Indian companies have to overcome before they can deliver on the $1 trillion promise. Indian engineers trained in the IT services industry may find it hard to develop the discipline required to build a product-focused company. In IT services, \"you are selling bodies and you say yes to everything the customer says,\" said Krishnamoorthy. SaaS companies, on the other hand, have to say no to 99% of [potential] customers, he added. And India's startup ecosytem is still relatively immature when compared to Silicon Valley. Despite the massive size of some homegrown unicorns, Mathrubootham said that the country does not have a \"global tech powerhouse product brand.\" But he hoped that future SaaS companies can change that. \"It is my personal dream to see India as a product nation,\" he added."},

Apple CEO Tim Cook kicked off the annual event on Wednesday with a depicting how the Apple Watch has saved lives by calling for help. One man described how he was skating on a frozen river when the ice gave out. Another survived a plane crash in a remote area in the middle of winter. And a high school student escaped a bear encounter. Another example from the event focused on a 27-year old high school teacher went to the emergency room after her Apple Watch detected an abnormally high heart rate. According to the teacher, \"My doctor said, 'It was your watch that saved your life.\" Apple has long presented its products as tools for creativity, productivity and a positive, if aspirational, lifestyle filled with friends and family, healthy habits and outdoor activities. Some of that was still on display at this year's event, but there was a new messaging, too. The company positioned many of its products and features as safety nets in a shaky world. Apple announced new car-crash detection technology on both the Apple Watch and iPhone which it says can determine the \"precise moment of impact\" using the device's barometer, GPS and microphone. \"We truly hope you never need it, but feel a little bit safer every time you get into a car,\" said Ron Huang, Apple's vice president of sensing and connectivity, during the announcement. It also unveiled a groundbreaking tool for iPhones that relies on satellites if, for example, you're lost in the wilderness and cellular service isn't working. And it introduced a new temperature monitoring tool on the Apple Watch that can be used to track illnesses, at a time when many may still be wrestling with pandemic health anxieties. While arguably a continuation of Apple's focus on health features, particularly with its smartwatches, the emphasis on these fearful use cases nonetheless raised some eyebrows among industry watchers. \"It was a little surprising to see Apple reach for the alarmist approach and position their devices as potential life savers,\" said Ramon Llamas, research director at market research firm IDC. In recent years, Apple has promised customers that its products can help for them -- one with stronger privacy protections and family-friendly content. Now its pitch appears to have expanded to keeping people safe in the real world. \"These emergency features are like the safety bags in your car: you aren't going to need them all the time, but you're grateful when you do,\" Llamas said. The shift in tone comes as Apple confronts a new economic landscape that could make it harder to convince customers to pay three- and four-figure amounts to upgrade their devices -- especially when some of those products are not substantially different from the prior year. The company introduced relatively minor across the board on Wednesday. The iPhone lineup, for example, updates to the camera systems, a new interactive lock screen and on the Pro models, much faster performance. Meanwhile, the new high-end is targeted toward extreme sports enthusiasts; while a market for rugged watches exists, not everyone needs tracking for deep ocean diving or triathlons. \"Refinement over revolution isn't a bad thing but if purses are tightening with the economy then these announcements are a harder sell without anything groundbreaking,\" said Eric Abbruzzese, a research director at market firm ABI Research. The emphasis on health and safety could also help Apple bolster its subscription services business, Abbruzzese said, which has been one of its fastest-growing revenue lines in recent years. As he points out, the satellite connectivity is \"only free for two years.\" (Apple has not specified how much it costs after that.) Moreover, \"advanced health tools seem like just another way to sell Fitness+ more strongly.\""},

But the 33-year-old hasn't regretted her decision \u2014 bitcoin's value has increased 15 times since then \u2014 and she continues to invest as much as 10% of her savings in cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ethereum. \"I find stock markets boring,\" she told CNN Business, adding that she enjoys the \"thrill\" and \"recklessness\" that comes with investing in volatile currencies. She is not the only one. India has seen a huge boom in cryptocurrency trading since the start of the pandemic, even though authorities in Asia's third largest economy have for years expressed concerns about digital currencies, and even Entrepreneurs in the industry told CNN Business that the country has the potential to become a crypto superpower, since it is one of the hottest internet markets in the world, with , and hundreds of millions more yet to come online for the first time. India ranked second behind only Vietnam last year in a list of countries seeing the fastest growth in cryptocurrency adoption, according to a report published in October by blockchain data platform Chainalysis. While the government does not keep estimates of how many people trade cryptocurrencies, industry experts have suggested that the country may now have more than . The growth is driven by younger investors \u2014 mostly under the age of 35 \u2014 and many of them are coming from smaller cities and towns, founders of two of India's biggest crypto exchanges told CNN Business. According to Sumit Gupta, CEO and co-founder of exchange CoinDCX, many Indian millennials have started \"their investing journey with crypto.\" While 20 years ago, their parents chose to invest in gold, these youngsters \"are more interested in having bitcoin as part of their portfolio,\" Gupta told CNN Business, referring to the fact that traditionally Indians chose to park their money in gold or savings accounts. is both an investment and a cultural habit in India, which is one of the largest markets for the precious metal, according to the . It also considered auspicious by Hindus and Jains, and plays a fundamental role in many religious ceremonies. Mumbai-based CoinDCX became India's first crypto unicorn last year, achieving a valuation of $1.1 billion after raising money from investors such as Coinbase Ventures and B Capital Group. The company says 70% of its 10 million users are between the age of 18 and 34. Data shared by rival firm WazirX tell a similar story. WazirX also has over 10 million users, and called 2021 a \" \" for crypto trading in India. The company was acquired by , one of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, in 2019. Over 65% of its users are under the age of 35, according to a recent company report, and it has seen a \"700% increase in the number of participants from smaller cities like Guwahati, Karnal, Bareilly, thereby signaling the growing interest from rural and semi-urban areas.\" Pritish Kumawat, a crypto trader from a small town in the western state of Rajasthan, said that he now finds conversations about cryptocurrencies in almost every tea shop in his area. Often, the most engaged participants are college students, he said, adding that bitcoin's massive spike last year has fueled the frenzy in India. In November, bitcoin was trading at a record high of , but it has since fallen to around $43,000. In addition to bitcoin, meme currencies such as dogecoin and shiba inu are also popular among Indians, the WazirX report added. Apart from investors from smaller towns, both companies saw an increase of more than 1000% in the number of women users on their platforms, albeit on a small base. Gupta said that participation of crypto by Indian women has seen \"a massive upside\" in the past 18 months and is \"fairly high, fairly healthy, relative to equity markets.\" The company's data shows that 15% of their overall users are women \u2014 which is the as well. The excitement over crypto is rising in India despite the country's on-again, off-again relationship with digital currencies. The central bank has long expressed concerns that cryptocurrencies can be used for money laundering and to finance terrorism. A cryptically worded proposal posted on the Indian parliament website last year even suggested the government was exploring plans to \"prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India.\" This year, however, started on a more cheerful note for enthusiasts. , the Indian government announced it would impose a 30% tax on income from virtual digital assets, which many industry experts took as a sign that crypto trading won't be banned after all. The government also said it would launch a digital rupee in the coming months. \"Taxation of virtual digital assets or crypto is a step in the right direction. It gives much-needed clarity and confidence to the industry,\" Gupta said at the time of the announcement. Siddharth Menon, the co-founder of WazirX, told CNN Business that following the announcement, his platform saw daily sign-ups jump by over 50%. He also noticed rising interest among Indian developers and other professionals in joining the crypto industry. \"I'm getting LinkedIn messages\" from senior executives in India, who are now more optimistic about the business, he said. In the past, Indian exchanges have struggled to hire and retain experienced people due to the lack of clear regulations. But the Indian government soon put a damper on the mood, by clarifying that the cryptocurrencies are not yet legal in the country. \"I am not doing anything to legalize it or ban it or not legalize it,\" Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in parliament a few days after announcing the tax rate. \"Banning or not banning will come subsequently ... But I will tax because it is a sovereign right.\" \"I think the government is not entirely sure what it wants to do from a policy perspective,\" said Anirudh Rastogi, founder of tech law firm Ikigaw Law, which works with crypto exchanges in India. \"It knows where it wants to land broadly. It wants to find the right balance where it is not disconnected from the global progress in blockchain and other tech, but it wants to also address concerns regarding cryptocurrency.\" Rastogi added that the \"extraordinarily high\" tax on crypto is a short-term fix, which will also acts as a deterrent to many investors. \"This rate is typically used to tax activities that are not considered economically productive, such as lottery,\" he said. \"So this could be an indication that the government wants to make revenue, but it does not see crypto trading as economically productive.\" For equities, India applies a 15% short-term capital gains tax if shares are sold in less than a year, and 10% if sold after a year. Gupta hopes that the government makes up its mind soon. India, with its vast pool of developers and enthusiastic young population, could be a \"superpower in the next five to 10 years,\" in cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, he said. \"What is missing right now is a clear regulatory framework,\" he added."},

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has slowed global growth and raised inflation through large energy supply disruptions -- Russia accounts for well over 10% of global oil and natural gas production.

Growth has stalled, youth unemployment is at a record high, , and companies are struggling with recurring The world's second biggest economy is grappling with the impact of severe drought and its vast real estate sector is suffering the consequences of running up too much debt. But the situation is being made much worse by Bejing's adherence to a , and there's no sign that's going to change this year. Within the past two weeks eight megacities have gone into full or partial lockdowns. Together these vital centers of manufacturing and transport are home to 127 million people. Nationwide, at least 74 cities had been closed off since late August, affecting more than 313 million residents, according to CNN calculations based on government statistics. Goldman Sachs last week estimated that cities impacted by lockdowns account for 35% of China's gross domestic product (GDP). The latest restrictions demonstrate China's uncompromising attitude to stamping out the virus with the strictest control measures, despite the damage. \"Beijing appears willing to absorb the economic and social costs that stem from its zero-Covid policy because the alternative \u2014 widespread infections along with corresponding hospitalizations and deaths \u2014 represents an even greater threat to the government's legitimacy,\" said Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a DC-based think tank. For Chinese leader Xi Jinping, maintaining that legitimacy is more vital than ever as he seeks to be selected for an unprecedented third term when the Communist Party meets for its most important congress in a decade \"Major policy shifts before the party congress appear unlikely, although we could see a softening in certain policies in early 2023 after Xi Jinping's political future has been assured,\" Singleton said. \"Even then, the Party is running short on both time and available policy levers to address many of the most pressing systemic threats to China's economy,\" he added. The economy will continue to worsen in the next few months, said Raymond Yeung, chief Greater China economist for ANZ Research. Local governments will be \"more inclined to prioritizing zero-Covid and snuffing out the virus outbreaks\" as the party congress approaches, he added. Tightening of Covid restrictions will hit consumption and investment during China's \"Golden September, Silver October,\" traditionally the peak season for home sales. In the meantime, a sharp slowdown in the global economy doesn't bode well for China's growth either, Yeung said, as weakening demand from the US and European markets will weigh on China's exports. He now expects Chinese GDP to grow by just 3% this year, missing Beijing's official target of 5.5% by a wide margin. Other analysts are even more bearish. Nomura cut its forecast to 2.7% this week. More than two years into the pandemic, Beijing is sticking to its extreme approach to the virus with forced quarantines, mass mandatory testing, and snap lockdowns. The policy was deemed successful in the early stage of the pandemic. China managed to keep the virus at bay in 2020 and 2021 and stave off the large number of deaths many other countries suffered, while following . At , Xi proclaimed that China's success in containing the virus was proof of the Communist Party's superiority over Western democracy. But the premature declaration of victory has come back to haunt him, as the highly transmissible Omicron variant makes the zero-Covid policy less effective. However, giving up on zero-Covid doesn't seem like an option for Xi, who this year has repeatedly put greater emphasis on defeating the virus than rescuing the economy. In in June, he said China must maintain its zero-Covid policy \"even though it might hurt the economy.\" At , he reaffirmed that approach and urged officials to look at the relationship between virus prevention and economic growth \"from a political point of view.\" \"Beijing has sought to cast its zero-Covid policies as evidence of the Party's strength, and therefore, by extension, Xi Jinping's leadership,\" Singleton said. Any change in approach may not come until next year, and even then it's most likely to be very gradual, said Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist for Pinpoint Asset Management. \"It will be a long process,\" he said, adding that Hong Kong where quarantine and testing rules for visitors have recently been relaxed could be \"an important leading indicator for what will happen in the mainland.\" While Beijing seems unwavering on its zero-Covid strategy, the government has rolled out a flurry of stimulus measures to boost the flagging economy, including unveiled last month to improve infrastructure and ease power shortages. The government is trying to achieve \"the best possible outcome\" for economic growth and jobs while sticking to zero-Covid, but it's \"very hard to balance the twin goals,\" said Yeung from ANZ. Recent data suggest the Chinese economy could be headed for another dismal performance in the third quarter. GDP in the second quarter from a year earlier, slowing sharply from growth of 4.8% in the first quarter. Official and private sector surveys released last week showed China's manufacturing industry contracting in August for the first time in three months, while growth in services slowed. \"The picture is not pretty, as China continues to battle the broadest wave of Covid infections thus far,\" Nomura analysts said in a research report on Tuesday. China's job market has deteriorated in the past few months. Most recent data showed that the unemployment rate among 16 to 24 year-olds hit an all-time high of 19.9% in July, the fourth consecutive month it had broken records. That means China now has about 21 million jobless youth in cities and towns. Rural unemployment isn't included in official figures. \"The most worrying issue is jobs,\" said ANZ's Yeung, adding that youth unemployment could climb to 20% or higher. Other economists say more job losses are likely this year as social distancing measures hurt the catering and retail industries, which in turn piles pressure on manufacturers. The deepening property market downturn is another major drag. The sector, which accounts for as much as 30% of China's GDP, has been crippled by a government campaign since 2020 to rein in reckless borrowing and curb speculative trading. Property prices have been falling, as have sales of new homes. While there could be a relaxation of zero-Covid rules in 2023, housing policy may not look very different after the party congress. \"We are unlikely to see the economy repeat the previous high growth of 5.5% or 6% for the next two years,\" said Yeung.

That was on full display during the company's earnings call Thursday night as he bemoaned New York City breakfasts, dunked on industry rivals and declared that anyone who thinks the United States isn't in a recession is \"crazy.\" While the mood was mostly upbeat \u2014 RH earnings for the second quarter beat expectations, and Friedman seemed pumped to join the call from RH Guesthouse, the company's brand new, ultra-luxury hotel in Manhattan's Meatpacking District \u2014 Friedman warned that third-quarter revenue could fall as much as 18% . That compares with 19% growth in the third quarter last year. \"I think the Fed finally really understands what they have to do. And it's not going to be pretty when interest rates go up the way they are,\" Friedman said.  shares initially slumped 1% on the grim outlook, but were up more than 5% Friday. Luxury brands tend to weather economic slowdowns better because they cater to wealthy people who are less deterred by higher borrowing costs. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise its key interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point \u2014 its third jumbo hike since June \u2014 later this month That's why you haven't seen, and likely will not see, heavy discounts or red-line Labor Day sales at RH, even if that means losing market share to competitors like West Elm or Wayfair. \"While everybody is, like, running around, trying to pick up the apples on the ground, we figured out how to build an apple-harvesting company,\" he said. \"It's just a different game we're playing.\" RH, formerly Restoration Hardware, has a market cap of more than $6.2 billion, and has made a hard pivot as a luxury lifestyle brand, with an emphasis on hospitality. RH Guesthouse, the company's new hotel, is certainly among the most expensive in city. There's no online booking, no photographs allowed, and no lobby. Also no pets or children. Rooms start at $3,500 a night and suites start at $7,500 a night. The restaurant in the space will be RH's 15th. That's where, according to Friedman, guests can find a good breakfast \u2014 something that he claims, rather controversially, is lacking in fair Gotham. \"You usually can't find good breakfast in this town. At least that's what I believe,\" he said on Thursday's earnings call. The hotel \u2014 its website takes issue with that word, prominently declaring \"this is not a hotel\" but rather \"our house\" \u2014 is so exclusive Friedman even refused to let images of the rooms appear in print. For a Wall Street Journal preview, the CEO agreed only to a photo of Friedman appears confident in his long-term strategy, saying the company is well-prepared to ride out the next year of economic turmoil. \"We've been through storms before ... We've been through the Great Recession before,\" he said. \"A lot of other people are going to stumble and fall.\" And while economists are divided over whether the US is in a recession or not \u2014 officially, recessions are determined by a group of economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research \u2014 Friedman believes the downturn is already well under way. \"Anybody who thinks we're not in a recession is crazy,\" Friedman told analysts. \"The housing market is in a recession, and it's just getting started. So it's probably going to be a difficult 12 to 18 months in our industry. But these are the times where you can really capitalize.\""},

The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.89% in the week ending September 8, up from 5.66% the week before, according to Freddie Mac. That is significantly higher than this time last year when it was 2.88%. After starting the year at 3.22%, mortgage rates rose sharply during the first half of the year, hitting 5.81% in mid-June. But since then, concerns about the economy and the Federal Reserve's mission to combat inflation have made them more volatile. Mortgage rates rose again as markets continue to manage the prospect of more aggressive monetary policy to combat elevated inflation,\" said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist. Rates had fallen in July and early August as recession fears took hold. But comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell at the central bank's annual meeting in Jackson Hole in August refocused investors' attention back on the Fed's fight against inflation, pushing rates higher. This week, investors looked for the release of the Fed's Beige Book, which provides a regional pulse on the US economy and indicators of what may happen with interest rates at the Fed's meeting at the end of September. Wednesday's release indicated sustained price increases in all twelve Fed districts, though there was a moderating rate of increase in nine of these districts, said Jones. \"This could be an early sign of the eventual ease in inflation, which would precede slowed interest rate hikes,\" said Hannah Jones, economic data analyst for Realtor.com. The Federal Reserve does not set the interest rates borrowers pay on mortgages directly, but its actions influence them. Mortgage rates tend to track 10-year US Treasury bonds. As investors see or anticipate rate hikes, they often sell government bonds, which sends yields higher and with it, mortgage rates. As mortgage rates have moved higher and home prices remain near record highs, many home buyers have put their search on hold. A year ago, a buyer who put 20% down on a median priced $390,000 home and financed the rest with a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage at an average interest rate of 2.88% had a monthly mortgage payment of $1,295, according to calculations from Freddie Mac. Today, a homeowner buying the same priced house with an average rate of 5.89% would pay $1,849 a month in principal and interest. That's $554 more each month. Applications for mortgages dropped last week, as the 30-year fixed rate moved back toward its June highs, said Mike Fratantoni, senior vice president and chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. Rates aren't likely to drop again soon, Fratantoni said, but the strong job market should ensure people will still want to buy houses. \"There is no sign of a rebound in purchase applications yet, but the robust job market and an increase in housing inventories should lead to an eventual increase in purchase activity.\" While mortgage rates are rising, the range of rates offered also has increased, according to Freddie Mac. That means that borrowers can benefit from shopping around for a better rate. Borrowers could save an average of $1,500 over the life of a loan by getting one additional rate quote and an average of about $3,000 if they get five quotes, according to Freddie Mac's research."},
{"url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/11/investing/stocks-week-ahead-inflation/index.html", "title": "The worst of inflation finally might be over ", "paragraphs": " . Is really peaking? Are growing more confident? We'll get those answers this week when the latest consumer and producer price indexes as well as retail sales figures for August all come out. The numbers could change the calculus for the Federal Reserve, which is guaranteed to raise interest rates again at its next policy meeting on September 21. The question is, by how much? Traders are still predicting another three-quarters of a percentage point, or , hike, the third straight move of that size. And Fed chair Jerome Powell said that \"the Fed has, and accepts, responsibility for price stability. We need to act right now.\" But could the odds of another huge rate hike edge lower if inflation data continues to suggest that \"price stability\" might finally be closer to reality? The consumer price index (CPI) numbers come out Tuesday morning while producer price index (PPI) figures will be released Wednesday. Keep in mind that at the end of July, the market was pricing in just a 28% probability of a 75 basis point hike in September. Investors now think there's an 88% chance of another super-sized hike, Economists are currently forecasting that consumer prices for August will fall slightly from July and that prices were up 8.1% over the past 12 months. Of course, 8.1% is still incredibly high by historical standards but it would be a notable slowdown from the June's 9.1% year-over-year spike in prices. \"We probably have seen the peak on inflation. Food and energy prices are coming down. There is more room to the downside,\" said Joe Kalish, chief global macro strategist with Ned Davis Research. Investors seem to begrudgingly accept the likelihood that the Fed will raise rates by 75 basis points again in a few weeks...regardless of what the August inflation data indicates. But traders are hoping that the September rate hike is the last one of such magnitude. Assuming the Fed boosts rates by three-quarters of a point on September 21, that would bring interest rates to a target range of 3% to 3.25%. Look at fed funds futures on the CME for November. As of midday Friday, investors were pricing in 70% odds of a half-point hike at the Fed's November 2 meeting ... to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%. There was just a 10% probability of a fourth straight 75 basis point increase, however, which could be one reason why stocks have rebounded so far in September following their August tumble. Wall Street is clearly betting that inflation trends will continue to head in the right direction. Economists also expect producer prices, the cost of goods at the wholesale level, to fall slightly in August. Forecasts are for a drop of 0.1% from July to August, following a 0.5% decrease from June to July. Producer prices surged 9.8% year-over-year in July but that's down from June's high water mark of 11.3%. Any further slowdown would likely be welcomed by the market, the Fed and consumers. That brings us to retail sales. Consumer spending figures for August are due out Thursday morning. The government reported last month that retail sales were up 10.3% year-over-year in July. It will be interesting to see if that rate of sales picked up in August or slowed down. The Fed is in a tough spot. It wants to put inflation pressures to rest and the way to do that is with big interest rate hikes. But the Fed would also like to avoid a recession if it can, which is why some are still hoping for a soft, or a . Powell also talked about rate hikes and inflation causing for the economy at his Jackson Hole speech last month. That could be an argument for the Fed to do smaller rate hikes...as long as inflation continues to cool. And that is the key point. Investors have to pay closer attention to the inflation data than whatever Powell or other Fed members are saying. The Fed remains data dependent, which is why rate hike odds are constantly in flux. \"There must be a convincing downward trend in inflation. We are not there yet,\" said David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth US, in a report Friday. The economy isn't the only thing in focus next week. Two software giants,  and  , will report their latest earnings. Investors will be watching for clues about the state of tech spending among big businesses. Shares of both companies have fallen this year, along with rest of the tech sector and broader market. Oracle is down nearly 15% while Adobe has plunged more than 30%. But analysts expect solid sales growth from both companies ... nearly 15% for Adobe from a year ago and an almost 20% increase from Oracle. One investment strategist said that big tech firms like Oracle and Adobe make sense for investors. \"We do own big techs that are much more mature and established,\" said Suzanne Hutchins, head of the real returns strategy and senior portfolio manager with Newton Investment Management. The results from Oracle and Adobe will also serve as a preview for the deluge of tech third quarter earnings that will come later in October. Solid results from these two could be a good sign for  ,  ,  and other cloud software firms. Still, the recent earnings from  , which was cautious about its guidance, could be a warning sign for both companies, according to Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager with Synovus Trust Company. Oracle and Adobe also could get hit by the surging dollar, since that will eat into profits from their international operations. \"Both companies generate more than 40% of sales outside the US,\" Morgan noted in a report.

{"url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/09/economy/overlooked-workers-labor-shortage/index.html", "title": "Employers need workers. That's good news for these people", "paragraphs": " With nearly the shortage of workers in the United States in the fight to acquire and retain talent. But for candidates who are typically overlooked by hiring managers, the labor shortage offers an opportunity. Advocates for marginalized populations such as people with disabilities, the formerly incarcerated and those who are housing-insecure, say today's labor market is enabling the people they work with to demonstrate to employers \u2014 and themselves \u2014 that they can be valuable contributors to a thriving economy. Employers today \"are more willing to give an opportunity for someone to demonstrate that they're qualified for the job,\" said Doug Smith, director of employment services at Chimes, a nonprofit organization that helps employ people with disabilities. \"We have, at least over the past year, seen a significant increase in the number of individuals being hired,\" he said. While the percentage of people with a disability who work is still very low, at 22.5%, this does represent an increase from 21.6% a year ago, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"I don't think employers can be quite as picky as they were being before,\" said Carley Kammerer, executive director of Wildflyer Coffee, a Minneapolis-based nonprofit organization that helps unhoused youth establish a stable living situation and acquire job skills. \"There is a sense of dignity and worth that comes from employment... Sometimes, just that confidence of making your own way and making a paycheck can go a long way.\" Kammerer said small-business owners are tapping her for insight \u2014 and sometimes for workers. \"People are almost seeing us as a staffing agency, so we've been able to increase opportunity and be almost like a pipeline or a referral source for our youth,\" she said. Brett Struwe, CEO of Sustenance Coffee in Minneapolis, said he had already raised pay by 15% to 20% when the labor market started to heat up last fall, but over the past six months he needs to keep up with the growth of his business. \"You have to do a lot of active recruitment to get the amount of labor you need in order to grow the business,\" Struwe said, adding that he has expanded his search and hired one of the young adults participating in the Wildflyer program to package coffee in his warehouse. The worker has been such a good fit that Struwe said he is preparing to hire a second worker from the program this fall. \"This is someone I want to be able to retain,\" he said. People with a prior felony conviction face a different \u2014 and in many ways, greater \u2014 challenge, said Aaron Sojourner, a labor economist and senior researcher at the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. \"Between 1980 and 2010, the share of Americans with a felony record tripled... the product of the rise in war on drugs and mass incarceration,\" he said. \"There's just a lot more people in our communities now who have that experience and have that barrier than there used to be.\" But as employers scramble to fill open positions, fair-chance hiring, which refers to employment practices that don't exclude or discriminate against candidates with criminal histories, is getting a closer look. \"We often don't need to post for jobs... When word gets out that you're in fair-chance hiring, you have people come to you,\" said Amanda LaGrange, CEO of RePowered, a St. Paul, Minnesota-based company that recycles electronic waste and that runs an on-the-job training program for the formerly incarcerated. \"There's a huge amount of talent, they're just disconnected,\" LaGrange said. \"So much of our work is around stigma reduction.\" Employers today seem to be more receptive to those messages. \"Employers are warming up to the idea of considering applicants they may not have previously, including those with a criminal record,\" said AnnElizabeth Konkel, senior economist at Indeed. Konkel said the number of job postings explicitly referencing these kinds of policies climbed by around 10% over the past three years, and the share of searches by job seekers using phrases like \"no background check\" has shot up by 75%. \"This data tells us that employers are broadening the pool of employees that they will consider hiring, and job seekers are aware of this,\" she said. Gabriel Mandujano, founder and CEO of Wash Cycle Laundry, operates a commercial laundry service in the Philadelphia, Boston and Washington, D.C., metro areas. \"In most of our facilities, we have to operate seven days a week,\" he said. \"One of the more frequent things we see is people might leave for a Monday-to-Friday schedule, and that's definitely something that didn't happen as frequently before the pandemic.\" Mandujano said Wash Cycle has had a longstanding commitment to employing people who are often overlooked by hiring managers, including people with criminal records and people with disabilities, a value he said has helped him add workers even during a labor shortage. Philadelphia resident Steve Stansbury had struggled to land stable employment since returning home in March 2021. \"I know it's because I have a record,\" he said. Stansbury, 34, was hired by Wash Cycle in November and promoted less than six months later. \"I actually had a conversation with my boss asking me what I wanted to do. It's what makes the job easier, because I'm doing something I like,\" he said. Stansbury said the job has given him a foundation to build a career and, he hopes, even start his own business one day. \"I haven't missed a day of work yet. I take it seriously... I don't want to go back to jail. I'm really applying myself,\" he said. \"If I didn't have this job, I don't know what I'd be doing.\" A lack of educational credentials or experience can also be a hurdle that keeps people from career-track work. \"We're seeing [fewer] people that are experienced in retail or have longevity with jobs. That's the wall we've been bumping up against,\" said Elise Lark, stores and operations manager at Paxton Gate, a natural science-themed retailer in Portland, Oregon. \"Our payroll has increased at least 30% or more, and that's just in the last year,\" Lark said, and the store recently expanded its health coverage. But even with these efforts, their attempts at hiring fell short. \"We're basically like a natural history museum, so it's very specialized retail... You need somebody who's enthusiastic about natural sciences,\" she said. Through a program that pairs local college students with mom-and-pop businesses, Lark said her store was able to hire a biology major on a part-time basis during the busy holiday season. \"This was a perfect opportunity for a student to learn real-world work experience,\" she said. Macy Buhler, owner of Yahara River Learning Center in DeForest, Wisconsin, said adding badly needed staff is a huge challenge. \"Even some Targets are paying $19 an hour. I can't compete with big companies right now, and that's a struggle,\" she said. Her preschool educators should have credentials at roughly the level of an associate's degree, but Buhler said the educational requirements can be a barrier for the young, working-class and often female child care labor pool. \"They need to work full time. They don't come from families where they can stop and go to school,\" she said. Buhler recently enrolled two new hires as part of a two-year pilot program run by the state that gives workers the opportunity to fulfill most of the requirements for their degree while being paid for on-the-job training. \"It's a more supported way for them to go back to school. I have to support them by giving them time on the job to do schoolwork,\" Buhler said, adding that one of her apprentices credited the program with making the attainment of a higher education feel accessible. \"She doesn't have people in her family who went to college [and] she told me she doesn't have anybody to give her that example.\" The labor market was already tightening up before the pandemic. Waves of retiring baby boomers, falling birth rates, a shortage of child care and a slowdown in immigration all suggested a longer-term challenge for hiring managers. And all of these issues were exacerbated by the pandemic. \"As early as 2018, when we saw unemployment rates continue to drop, [we realized] we no longer have the luxury of broadly not considering people,\" said Johnny C. Taylor Jr., president and CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management. \"The problem is the stigma\" these populations often face from human resources and hiring managers, Taylor said. \"Every employer has to... give people permission to hire from untapped pools of talent. We have to drive that into our organization.\" Attaining and maintaining stable employment is a critical part of drawing these people not only into the labor force, but into their communities at large, Sojourner said. \"When people are locked out of the labor force, they struggle to find ways to contribute to the community,\" he said. Once employed, they can support themselves and their families and contribute meaningfully to the local economy. It's better for the workers themselves, too. \"Getting an employment history definitely helps you stay employed,\" Sojourner said. It is easier for workers to have their choice of jobs if they have references and a track record to demonstrate their commitment to a job. And in an economy where the biggest wage gains are realized when workers switch jobs, having mobility is key to unlocking their earnings potential. Taylor is optimistic that today's job market and the likelihood that worker shortages will remain a challenge for employers could ultimately lower barriers for people who seek to enter or reenter the workforce. \"We've had a low and increasingly low American birth rate over the years [that] is not going to resolve itself,\" he said. \"I think there has been a true philosophical paradigm reset.\""},

They will all be replaced  ", "paragraphs": " Billions of banknotes and coins around the world featuring the portrait of are set to be replaced following her death. For almost 70 years, the Queen's image has appeared on the United Kingdom's coins, with different portraits of her profile as she aged. She was featured on the nation's banknotes for more than 60 years, the first British monarch to do so. Her portrait also features on the currency of several countries that were formerly under British rule. Since 1953, one year after the Queen took the throne, UK coins have borne five different versions of her portrait. She appeared on the country's banknotes starting in 1960. But now, the Bank of England, which prints the country's banknotes, and the Royal Mint, which makes its coins, face the sizeable task of withdrawing that and replacing it with money bearing the portrait of King Charles III. There are more than 4.7 million banknotes in circulation in the UK, worth a collective \u00a382 billion ($95 billion), according to the central bank. There are also around 29 billion coins circulating, the Royal Mint said. The new money is likely to introduced gradually, and coexist as legal tender with the old notes and coins for a period of time. A similar phase-in happened in 2017, when the Royal Mint began issuing a new 12-sided \u00a31 coin. The new coin circulated at the same time as the old round-shaped \u00a31 for six months before the latter lost its status as legal tender. But it's not just cash that will require a makeover. The UK faces a mammoth operation to change the royal insignia on thousands of post boxes and newly issued passports. The Royal Mint said in a statement on its website that coins bearing the image of the Queen \"remain legal tender and in circulation,\" and that their production would continue as usual during \"this period of respectful mourning.\" The Bank of England said that the Queen's \"iconic portraits [were] synonymous\" with some of its most important work. \"Current banknotes featuring the image of Her Majesty The Queen will continue to be legal tender,\" it said in a Thursday statement. (At one point Friday, so many people were attempting to access the Royal Mint's website that there was a virtual queue to get in.) The central bank said it would lay out its plans to replace existing banknotes once the period of mourning ends. The Royal Mint also said that it would make an announcement in due course. The Queen's image is also emblazoned on some banknotes and coins across the Commonwealth \u2014 an association of 54 countries, almost all of which were formerly colonized by the UK. In Canada, where the Queen remains the head of state, her image features on plastic $20 banknotes. \"The current polymer $20 bank note is intended to circulate for years to come. There is no legislative requirement to change the design within a prescribed period when the Monarch changes,\" Am\u00e9lie Ferron-Craig, a spokesperson for the Bank of Canada, said in a statement to CNN Business. Canada's finance minster is responsible for approving the design of new banknotes, Ferron-Craig added, and issuing those notes usually takes a few years. In Australia, too, the Queen's portrait features on the $5 note. The Reserve Bank of Australia said on Friday that there would be no \"immediate change\" to its banknotes. It added that its $5 notes would \"not be withdrawn\" and would likely stay in circulation for years."},

In a time when most photos don't leave the confines of a smartphone,  ,  ,  , Albertsons and other chains still offer photo prints, greeting cards, books, film processing and other services. Who needs to print photos anymore? Well, there's still demand from some customers: Photo services bring traffic into these retailers' stores, particularly during the peak holiday, graduation and wedding seasons. More than 50% of photo prints made this year will come from a retail store, totaling about $786 million in sales, said David Haueter, a longtime photo industry analyst and the founder of consulting and market research firm Rise Above Research. Around 4.2 billion 4'' x 6\" prints alone will be developed at stores this year, he added. \"People aren't printing as much as they used to, but there are still people who like to print,\" said Haueter. Retro technology and older gadgets have in part because they allow people to unplug from the constant ping-ping-ping of their devices. Interest among Gen Z and Millennials in film cameras has picked up in recent years. Photography became a popular hobby, with camera sales spiking on sites like  and  . Disposable cameras have also with younger consumers, as celebrities like and Gigi Hadid have been spotted with them, driving interest. Haueter said many consumers like ordering photo prints and products at stores like CVS because they get the goods immediately, with no shipping charges. They're often heading to these drug stores to pick up other stuff, too. CVS offers photo services in around 7,600 stores. \"We continue to see a strong demand for this service \u2014 especially around gift-giving seasons,\" a spokesperson said. More than 8,000 Walgreens stores offer photo services, said Raghu Valata, Walgreens' senior director of digital commerce strategy and planning. \"Holidays tend to be a busy time for our photo business, with the highest foot traffic generally seen in December,\" Valata said. Though drug stores and other retailers have kept their photo services in stores, it's not the answer for every business:  and  have nixed them in recent years. Costco last year photo centers at all of its roughly 800 stores, that the \"continued decline of prints no longer requires on-site photo printing\" and that \"digital technologies allow consumers to do more with their photos.\" But at Walmart, by contrast, around 3,700 stores have Fujifilm photo kiosks \u2014 typically located within the store's electronics department and they're often put to use. It's a service that \"customers utilize quite regularly,\" a Walmart spokesperson said, including people who may not have access to a computer to order prints online. \"We maintain a healthy business year-round.\""},

They're also swallowing their medicine \u2014 US stocks initially plummeted on Thursday morning as they grappled with new, hawkish comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on top of a three-quarter point rate hike from the European Central Bank. But by the end of the day, they had shrugged it off and markets closed higher. The Federal Reserve doesn't like to surprise financial markets with rate hikes, and so it's making its intentions fairly clear. , and they delivered similar lines. One by one officials acknowledged the economic and market pain their hiking policy could inflict and then reiterated that for the time being they would keep on with their aggressive regime to fight pervasively high inflation rates.

Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Nomura analysts all used this week's messaging as reason to raise their forecasts for the next Fed policy decision on September 21 from a half point hike to three-quarters of a point. Data shows the economy has been making progress towards achieving the soft landing that the Fed is hoping for. Core and headline inflation were softer in July, commodity prices are falling, the dollar is strong, and supply-chain kinks are improving. The labor market is showing early signs of cooling off, and GDP growth is also slowing. But Fed officials have suggested that this isn't enough. \"Fed officials have sounded hawkish recently and have seemed to imply that progress toward taming inflation has not been as uniform or as rapid as they would like,\" wrote Goldman Sachs researchers led by chief economist Jan Hatzius in a note Thursday. Nothing is written in stone and a slew of economic and inflation data out later this month will guide the Fed's next moves. If next week's Consumer Price Index report surprises to the downside, the Fed may consider a less aggressive rate hike. \"Although we move to a 75 basis point rate hike in September, we acknowledge there are risks to a smaller 50 basis point hike,\" wrote Bank of America analysts. \"The Fed received some negative feedback on its messaging during the last blackout period, and it may be the case that participants feel like it is time to back away from effectively pre-announcing policy rate moves.\" on Thursday sent the United Kingdom into a period of national mourning for the country's longest-reigning monarch. That official period of reflection comes at a time of political and economic transition for the British economy. It's been less than a week since Liz Truss was sworn in as the country's prime minister and the economy is grappling with surging inflation rates, Ukraine-war induced commodity shortages, and an impending energy crisis. Financial institutions, meanwhile, are struggling to figure out how to pay their respects to the Queen while keeping more economic chaos at bay. The Bank of England delayed its next interest rate decision, due September 15, by a week. The London Stock Exchange, however, plans to continue on at full speed.

Former President Donald Trump isn't going public yet. But he lives to fight another day. The blank-check firm, or SPAC, seeking to merge with Trump's new media venture and take it public, won shareholder support on Thursday to extend its merger agreement deadline to October 10,  SPACs \u2014 or publicly traded shell entities created to acquire or merge with a private company and take it public \u2014 typically have two years to find a company to acquire before the owners must return funds to investors. Digital World Acquisition's plan to merge with Truth Social owner Trump Media & Technology Group has been held up by investigations from federal authorities, leaving the fate of the $1.3 billion in cash raised in the company's public offering and the listing of Trump Media on the stock market up in the air. Digital World has repeatedly delayed the merger, and shareholders at first appeared reluctant to kick the can down the road once more, reports my colleague Matt Egan. Ultimately, they came around to the decision. The merger agreement has also been held up because of claims that Trump Media owes more than $1 million to a contractor. Trump shrugged off the controversy and suggested that he didn't actually want to go public in a Truth Social post on Saturday. \"In any event, I don't need financing, 'I'm really rich!' Private company anyone???\" the former president wrote in his typical posting style. Kroger reports earnings before the bell. \u25b8 European Union officials meet to discuss the energy crisis"},

Colleges specializing in funeral service education are growing enrollment amid a dearth of workers in the funeral services industry. \"The shortage is so serious right now that there's a 90% job placement rate for graduates of these programs,\" said Leili McMurrough, program director at Worsham College of Mortuary Science in Wheeling, Illinois, one of the nation's oldest mortuary schools dating back to 1911. In 2021, nationwide new student enrollment in accredited mortuary science programs jumped 24% over 2020, according to the American Board of Funeral Service Education. The overall percentage increase in enrollment of students in the 58 accredited mortuary programs or institutions in the United States could be even higher this year, said McMurrough, who is also chair of the American Board of Funeral Service Education (AFBSE) Committee on Accreditation. Randy Anderson, president of the National Funeral Directors Association, is acutely aware of the labor crunch and says colleges can't churn out licensed workers fast enough to meet the need for new hires. Demand for funeral directors is especially high, and an aging workforce has made it a race against the clock, said Anderson. \"There's an urgent need to replace those who have been in the profession for many years and are retiring,\" he said. \"Over 60% of funeral home owners said they will retire in five years. That's a lot.\" The NFDA currently has more than 20,000 members, and each state has its own apprenticeship and licensing requirements, Anderson said. Most states also require funeral directors to graduate from an accredited college or university program. According to latest government data, the funeral industry generates over $16 billion in annual revenue. There were more than 18,800 funeral homes in the US in 2021, majority of them privately owned small businesses, down from 19,902 in 2010, according to industry numbers. Women currently make up as much as 72% of recent graduates of funeral services education, according to latest AFBSE numbers. Said Anderson, \"until the 1970s, men dominated. Every decade since then, the number of women coming into the profession has increased.\" And they're younger, too At Worsham, McMurrough said, the typical student is a 24- to 29-year-old woman, but many are older applicants seeking a new career. \"There's a big interest in this field from women, and it makes sense. Women absolutely have an empathetic bent and are perhaps better prepared to help families get through a very difficult life event,\" said Ed Michael Reggie, CEO of , an online resource to help families find a funeral home or crematorium provider that best meets their needs. \"No one plans to be a funeral director, unless you have a parent in the business,\" said Reggie. \"But as a first-time career, it's general not a costly degree. It's a shorter program than a full college degree and you can make $60,000 to $75,000 a year.\" Ellen Wynn McBrayer is a funeral director at Jones-Wynn Funeral Home and Crematorium, a third generation family business with two locations in Georgia. Her grandmother, Shirley Drew Jones, was the first woman to be a licensed funeral director in the state. McBrayer said her grandmother hoped more women would enter the profession. \"The new and younger people who are coming in are also more open-minded about not doing things the same way, but customizing the service to what families want,\" said McBrayer. \"A funeral is not just a day in the life but a lifetime in one day.\" Several factors are fueling growing interest in the profession. At her school, McMurrough said enrollment numbers rose after Worsham began offering its online program two years ago. \"This gave those people who had another job but were also interested in the field the flexibility to be able to pursue it,\" she said. Worsham offers a one-year associates degree (tuition $22,800) and a 16-month online associate degree program (tuition $24,800). Eighty percent of the most recent cohort of students in the college's online course were women, she said. Quick career advancement is another appeal. These aren't six figure-level jobs -- median wages for funeral industry jobs, such as funeral home managers was $74,000 and $48,950 for morticians, undertakers and funeral arrangers in 2021, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But \"you do have the opportunity to advance in just a few years from getting your college degree to becoming funeral director or even owning your own funeral home,\" said McMurrough. The pitfalls are there, too. \"There are some areas of the profession that haven't yet caught up to other industries in terms of competitive salaries. That remains a challenge in recruiting and retaining workers,\" said Anderson of the National Funeral Directors Association. Burnout is another challenge. \"At the height of the pandemic, people throughout the industry were working non-stop, without days off,\" said McMurrough. \"But you do it because you care. Yet many new students said the pandemic also influenced their desire to serve their communities, said McMurrough. \"So many people experienced death in the last two years in ways that they were not expecting. Families couldn't grieve the way they wanted to,\" she said. \"In some instances, funeral home staff became the last ones to see those who had passed instead of their own families. These moments made an impact on people.\" Hannah Walker, who graduated from Worsham over the summer, is one of them. 'I certainly did not ever plan to graduate from this program but my grandfather first opened my eyes to it,\" said Walker, 31, who lives in Michigan. Her experience with his death from prostate cancer, before the pandemic, and his funeral helped her reframe what the experience could be for other families. So about two and a half years ago, Walker took the first step, calling several funeral homes and asking if she could job shadow one of their employees to get first-hand experience. \"I did it for almost a year and realized this was for me. I cared enough to want to do this,\" she said. Walker graduated from Worsham College on Friday and has a job waiting for her at the funeral home where she job shadowed once she finishes her apprenticeship and gets her state license to practice. \"This isn't a career path for everyone,\" said Anderson. \"You have to be drawn to it and to the opportunity of helping your fellow man and be satisfied with just that.\""},

Cayette, who uses a wheelchair, called parish officials for help. They never came. Parish officials, however, told CNN that they did not receive calls that match Cayette's situation, adding that the government is \"by law, not allowed to enter or conduct work on private property unless it is an emergency life saving measure.\" It wasn't until two days later when a group of volunteers from New Orleans came to saw and remove the trees that he was able to go outside. \"I've seen it all,\" Cayette, a retired industry worker, told CNN. \"After Hurricane Betsy in 1965, the chemical plants started building and operating. A lot of them. It all changed.\" About 50 miles away in St. John the Baptist Parish, Robert Taylor Jr., executive director of Concerned Citizens of St. John, said many residents were trapped in their attics after the storm while others witnessed their roofs being ripped off by Ida. The lack of after the hurricane, Taylor said, is just another example of the neglect the community has long suffered. Residents say the government failed to prepare the community for the storm by not issuing an evacuation order earlier or assisting poor and vulnerable residents who could not manage to flee their homes, like Cayette. \"The government is obviously failing us and not protecting us,\" said Taylor, who evacuated from St. John before Hurricane Ida hit. \"And this just pushed it over the top.\" The predominantly Black community of St. John and the nearly majority Black population of St. James sit at the heart of Louisiana's \"Cancer Alley,\" the 85-mile stretch between New Orleans and Baton Rouge that's home to more than 150 chemical plants and oil refineries. According to the Environmental Protection Agency's 2019 , \u2014 census areas that typically contain 600 to 3,000 people \u2014 with the country's estimated highest cancer risks are in St. John. Until recently, Cayette, who has lived in the region for 70 years and previously worked at a nearby petrochemical plant, never connected the growth of the chemical industry to the region's suddenly high cancer rates. But then his wife died of breast cancer a few years ago -- and he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer on top of his diabetes. Now, he lives alone with the sight of industrial facilities looming outside his window. \"I was mad and disappointed at the government,\" Cayette said about the lack of response after Ida. \"What concerned me even more is that I'm disabled, but they couldn't come to help.\" For decades, scientists have claimed the planet has been rapidly warming because of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from the burning of fossil fuels. Days after Ida ravaged the homes of and Mississippi, the EPA concluding that racial and ethnic minority communities disproportionately suffer the most severe consequences of climate change, indicating they are the least able to prepare for, and recover from, extreme climate events such as pollution, flooding and heat waves. If the planet reaches the critical warming threshold of 2 degrees Celsius -- which most unless they drastically cut emitting greenhouse gases from fossil fuels -- the report warns that Black people are projected to face the worst impacts of the climate crisis. \"It's absolutely an insult that the companies that are responsible for this are also the ones that are driving climate change,\" Naomi Yoder, staff scientist at the Healthy Gulf, a group working to restore natural resources in the region, told CNN. \"They're also one of the biggest drivers of land loss in Louisiana, which makes the effects of hurricanes worse.\" The coronavirus pandemic has also hit both parishes especially hard. In April 2020, St. John had the highest death rate per capita for Covid-19 in the United States, surpassing even the most densely populated urban hotspots. Around that time in St. James, the Covid-19 death rate was also than the overall national death rate. More than a year later, with the pandemic persisting, Category 4 Hurricane Ida threw the area's high cancer and Covid-19 rates and underlying environmental health hazards, which come from the area's rampant pollution from fossil fuel industries, into harsh relief. \"It's just risk on top of risk on top of risk,\" Kimberly Terrell, director of community engagement at the Tulane University Environmental Law Clinic, told CNN. \"There's always air pollution coming out of industrial facilities, and these communities have been burdened with that for decades.\" The Rev. Lionel Murphy, pastor of Tchoupitoulas Chapel in St. John, said the storm left devastating damage to his church along with homes and other buildings in the parish, exacerbating the emotional and physical toll that air pollution and health disparities have placed on communities. \"If only we can get some attention,\" Murphy said, referring to public officials and emergency responders. \"The people are going to leave and come back, but this storm aggravates so much else because Covid is pretty strong in St. John.\" In the early months of the pandemic, Harvard's school of public health released a showing a link between fine particulate matter, also known as PM 2.5 pollution, and increased mortality rates from Covid-19. Terrell wanted to know what that meant for Louisiana, particularly in Cancer Alley. After scraping the raw data from the Harvard study and performing her own analysis, she found that the highest death rates from Covid-19 and a majority of PM 2.5 concentrations were in Cancer Alley. Ida added another layer of affliction by destroying houses and forcing residents to emergency shelters or relatives' homes, where they may be clustered together with potential for increased Covid-19 transmission. \"It seems like these communities are just continually burdened with risks that they didn't ask for, and don't deserve to be burdened with,\" Terrell said. The current 7-day average is more than 42 new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 in St. John and more than 177 new cases per 100,000 in St. James, according to . The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention categorizes St. John and St. James as a community with high levels of Covid-19 transmission. Taylor said he worries that residents who have been sickened by cancer as well as Covid-19 won't get the medical care they need after having to evacuate because of Ida's impacts. Some are being transported to shelters where they could potentially spread Covid-19 or even contract it, he said, echoing Terrell's concern. Prior to Ida, of residents in St. James Parish and St. John Parish were living below the poverty line, according to Census data. \"This is a mess,\" Taylor told CNN. \"I don't see how poor people are expected to survive this.\" The proliferation of petrochemical facilities and oil refineries throughout Cancer Alley has become a familiar sight to residents along the industrial corridor. Cayette said he remembers industrial facilities emerging after Category 4 Hurricane Betsy pummeled the region in 1965. But it was only recently that residents began to realize the invisible danger the industry caused on public health and the ironic effects it has on the climate. When a hurricane is barreling toward an industry-heavy region, petrochemical facilities and oil refineries typically begin to shutter their plants, which involves burning anywhere from hundreds to of hazardous materials. As part of emergency shutdown procedures, these facilities emit or burn various unprocessed chemicals and gases through a process known as flaring. Oftentimes, Yoder said, the emissions continue to escape even after the hurricane has knocked out power lines. \"This is not something new to these communities, and it's not necessarily even unique to a disaster situation,\" Terrell said of refineries emitting toxic compounds. \"It seems like consistently the people who are breathing these toxins are the last to find out about it.\" In St. Charles Parish, for instance, a Shell Norco manufacturing complex has been spewing residual gases as residents pick through the rubble of Hurricane Ida's aftermath. After the storm, the EPA contacted Shell about the excessive smoke and reports of noxious gas coming out of its refinery. In a report, that Shell is conducting \"community air monitoring\" and \"looking at all options to try to reduce emissions to flare.\" \"While the site is safe and secure, we are experiencing elevated flaring due to a lack of steam generation,\" Curtis Smith, a Shell spokesperson, told CNN. \"Crews are working around the clock to complete repairs and we are making good progress on minimizing flaring until power is restored.\" In St. James Parish, residents like Sharon Lavigne have been fighting new petrochemical plants attempting to set up shop in their community. Five years ago, Lavigne was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis. Blood tests revealed that she had aluminum inside her body, which she later blamed on the slew of industrial facilities after attending a few environmental justice workshops. Angered by what she learned about the industry growing in her backyard, Lavigne founded RISE St. James, a faith-based environmental justice group trying to stop any new industrial development in Cancer Alley, which Cayette is also a member of. One of their was against the Taiwanese plastics manufacturer Formosa, which was set to build a in St. James Parish. Not only do Formosa's own that their mammoth facility could emit more of the cancer-causing compound than just about any other facility in the country, but their chosen location also happens to sit on two former 19th-century sugarcane plantations and a , according to a filed against the facility. \"My grandparents lived on this land. They bought this land and lived on it,\" Lavigne told CNN. \"And then when I got married, I built a house on this land.\" And while Formosa tried to push ahead with its construction during the pandemic, RISE St. James fought hard to block the company, delaying the construction further. The US Army Corps of Engineers early this year ordered Formosa to conduct a new environmental review of the petrochemical facility, thanks to legal complaints, protests and lawsuits like RISE St. James. While the battle to block the multibillion-dollar facility isn't over, Hurricane Ida added to the community's problems. The storm tore Lavigne's roof and caused her ceiling to collapse, just like it did to many other houses in the parish. \"So many of us suffered damages from Ida,\" Lavigne said, \"so after RISE members rebuild, we're going to help the rest of the community.\" Cancer Alley has faced many disasters, but none as challenging as a hurricane, air pollution and pandemic happening at once. To Cayette and Lavigne, living next to industrial facilities is a death sentence. It may take years for the community to recover, but Lavigne said they've been victorious before. As long as the fossil fuel industry continues to warm the planet and pollute their backyards, she said grassroots organizations will keep fighting. \"People tell me they're glad we're fighting the industry,\" she said. \"Many tell me they can't be out there to help me, but they're praying for me. That was nice.\""},

I've visited the Wall of Wind on the Florida International University (FIU) campus many times. It is a wall of enormous fans inside a big warehouse-type building that can blow air up to 160 mph, which would be a Category 5 hurricane, to test infrastructure and research the power of wind. However, in our changing climate, sadly, 160 mph isn't strong enough. So, the National Science Foundation (NSF) just awarded a $12.8 million Extreme Events Institute for the design of a full-scale testing facility capable of producing winds of 200 mph, along with a water basin to simulate storm surge and wave action in extreme winds. FIU will be able to build a house under the current building codes, start up the fans and see if it can withstand 200 mph winds. Will the roof detach? Will the house still be standing at all? The water basin will look like an enormous pool. It will also be able to simulate different coastlines. Storm surge tends to be worse when the coastlines are more shallow like along the Florida Panhandle. The facility will be able to simulate all of it. \"If you think about trying to future-proof, a changing hazard environment, a hazard scape, the US hazard scape with climate change, the past is not much of a guide. In fact, it can be deceiving,\" said Dr. Richard Olson, director of the Extreme Events Institute at FIU. \"So, if we're going to future-proof, we need to be able to research and test what future hazard events will look like. You can't future-proof in a changing environment if you're looking backwards.\" It's true. Climate change is showing us r, moving slower and are holding more water than ever before. They are also rapidly intensifying, meaning the winds are increasing at least 35 mph in a 24-hour period. In 2021, five hurricanes in the Atlantic rapidly intensified. And in 2020, TEN Atlantic hurricanes rapidly intensified. of those storms. \"Dorian in 2019 is the one that totally got my attention,\" said Olson. \"It hit 185 mph over the Bahamas, and until the last day and a half, it was heading straight up Eighth Street in Miami.\" Dorian ended up causing across Abaco and Grand Bahama. \"The scientific consensus is that we're going to see more intense storms, so we have to research and test for more intense storms,\" said Olson. \"Otherwise, nature's going to keep hitting us with harder stuff than we're ready for.\" The facility will be the first of its kind in the world to combine wind speeds of greater magnitude along with a water component. Eventually the facility will be able to test how different types of infrastructure, roads, bridges will all respond with a Category 6 storm. \"We can start putting all of these components together to get a much better picture of what nature is going to be hitting us with,\" says Olson. Yes, I realized I just referred to it as a Category 6 storm. And it might make some of you a little uncomfortable. To be honest, it bothers me a little bit too. But to be fair, if you look at the for the hurricanes, they are all -- more or less -- in about 20 mph increments. When a Category 5 hurricane's wind speeds start at 157 mph, and we see storms with maximum sustained winds of 180 mph, it's a number that makes me go pale. Since 2010, there have been 18 storms globally with recorded wind speeds of at least 178 mph at some point during their life span. and were two storms in the Atlantic to meet the threshold. It begs the question, especially for messaging purposes, do these types of storms need a special name? Category 6? Super-hurricane? Just something to put an exclamation point on how intense these specific storms are. But the truth of the matter is, most people who die in hurricanes don't die from wind, but from water. I reached out to my friend, Dennis Feltgen, the public affairs officer at the National Hurricane Center (NHC) about whether he thought there would ever be a day in our future we would see a Category 6, and here is what he had to say: I do agree with Dennis, but I also think as storms become stronger, wetter and slower, there might be a day the category system evolves from what it is now, just as the EF scale or Fujita scale was in 2007. And by the way, the same facility will also test tornado and thunderstorm winds. There are a few research facilities studying extreme winds. Watch below to see what 100 mph winds can do to a house. \"I think the interaction between the various components of hurricanes, the waves, the flooding, the currents, and the wind, the debris, all of that, it's very important to simulate that as practically as possible,\" said Dr. Arindam Gan Chowdhury, professor of environmental engineering at FIU. \"Everything is not possible to replicate Mother Nature.

It's called cloud seeding, and it's nothing new. It's been around since the 1940s and countries all over the world have been doing it for various reasons , but it's a growing practice in the US, especially in the drought-stricken West. It's also surrounded with controversy. We spoke with Julie Gondzar who is the program manager for , who admits she gets lots of calls about what they are doing. Gondzar said some people say \"you're playing God,\" others say \"you are stealing moisture from the storm,\" making other areas drier than they normally would be, kind of like robbing Peter to pay Paul. There are also environmental factors to consider, as well as the cost-effectiveness versus the reward, which in the West these days water is liquid gold. \"Think about it like water storage, but in the winter on mountaintops,\" is how Gondzar described what cloud seeding is trying to achieve in her state, \"in a nutshell.\" Wyoming started cloud seeding in 2003 . Then eight seasons ago, they started doing it in an official capacity after their 10-year study proved it works. This season, they have gone on 28 flight missions for cloud seeding in Wyoming. She pointed out there are four weeks left in the season, so she is hoping for more opportunities before it winds down. When you compare Wyoming to other states such as Utah and North Dakota, who have been cloud seeding since the '70s and '80s, the state is fairly new to the game. Cloud seeding uses an already existing cloud, and injects silver iodide into the cloud, which adds tiny particles called ice nuclei (which water needs to freeze). Clouds, in basic terms, are a collection of water droplets and/or ice crystals floating in the sky. The nuclei help the cloud produce precipitation, and artificial ice nuclei help create more precipitation than the cloud would produce otherwise. It's done in two ways: One way is from the ground and the other is from the air, using silver iodide as the seeding agent. \"The ground-based generators kind of look like small weather stations, are like 20 feet tall, and they aerosolize into the atmosphere,\" Gondzar explained. \"But you have to wait for the right atmospheric conditions so that the plume goes over the mountain range.\" It makes seeding a little more tricky, because if the wind is blowing in the wrong direction, you'll completely miss your target. The most popular way is by plane, using flares. \"There are flares on the wing of the planes with silver iodide inside of cardboard casings and there are flares on the belly of the plane,\" Gondzar pointed out. Once the pilot flies into the storm, they ignite the cardboard casings full of silver iodide and \"seed\" the clouds. The result is more moisture in the cloud, resulting in more precipitation. The silver iodide \"is a natural salt compound,\" Gondzar emphasized. \"The reason it's used is because the geometric shape down to a molecular level is very similar to that of an ice crystal. And if you don't have that, you're not going to create additional ice crystals, which will then accumulate into snowflakes.\" But if you think you can bust the drought by using planes to modify the weather, Gondzar said think again. \"Cloud seeding does not fix the drought,\" Gondzar said. \"You can't break a drought with cloud seeding. It's a tool in the toolbox.\" Gondzar admitted while they know the method makes more snow than they would otherwise receive, it's difficult to know exactly how much more they are getting. \"There's evidence of it in radar and all kinds of papers written,\" Gondzar noted. \"The question that they're trying to answer now is how well does it work? And that's a difficult question to answer. Because there's an abstract piece of this. There's really no way to know how much snow a particular system would have produced.\" She knows cloud seeding doesn't generate a lot of additional snowfall, but every little bit helps these days. According to , some areas in the state are only at 60% of average for snowpack this season, and the window for additional snow is slowly closing as the season winds down. Since most of the West gets the majority of its water from snowmelt, she hopes what they are doing helps a tiny bit in the long term. \"It's a small incremental change over a long period of time. That's why consistency is important,\" Gondzar urged. She added at $28-$34 per acre foot, cloud seeding is relatively cheap. \"Those numbers tell us that this is an inexpensive way to help add water to the system. Essentially, we are creating a little bit of additional snowpack, that becomes additional streamflow in the spring and summer.\" But you need a cloud, to cloud seed. You can't just go out to the Mojave Desert and make it rain. \"This is not something that we can do out of thin air,\" Gondzar cautioned. \"The criteria is very specific for this to actually work.\" It can only be done within already existing clouds that were going to produce snow anyway and there has to be a certain temperature range. \"The silver iodide in the cloud is initiating that snow,\" Gondzar said. \"But you can't just make snow out of nothing. You have to have the supercooled liquid water in the cloud.\" She explained part of what made this year difficult was the much drier weather during the last month. There were fewer opportunities to cloud seed. \"A lot of people think it's manipulating the weather pattern,\" Gondzar remarked. \"We are essentially just playing with cloud dynamics and cloud physics, on a super, super-small scale.\" She is a meteorologist as well and points out the moisture from the weather systems come from much bigger areas like the Gulf of Mexico or the Pacific. \"There's always a huge stream of moisture that our systems are tapping into, and cloud seeding probably brings an additional one to 2% down to the surface.\" While Gondzar is confident cloud seeding doesn't steal snow from another area, some scientists disagree. Daniel Swain is a climate scientist at UCLA and spoke with my colleague and climate writer . He told her \"It is possible that you're actually stealing water from someone else when you do this, because it may be, at least on a regional basis, a zero-sum game where if water falls out of the cloud in one spot, it's even drier by the time it makes it downwind to the next watershed.\" He went on to ask, \"To what extent are you just shifting around the spatial distribution of precipitation during a scarcity period rather than actually causing it to rain or snow more overall?\" He believes water equity issues need to be researched more. Another note of controversy has been the safety of the chemicals used in cloud seeding. Gondzar stressed it is not made of harmful chemicals like some people claim. She pointed out they did lots of testing for before they started officially cloud seeding and could not find any traces of harmful amounts of silver. \"There's silver in natural background levels in the water in the soil everywhere, on the surface of the earth,\" Gondzar noted. \"So you already have a natural background level of silver, it's been really difficult to find anything beyond background levels.\" She said the amount of silver iodide used is only a few grams at a time. What she's hoping is a small price to pay for bigger rewards down the road. There have been climate concerns surrounding cloud seeding. Here's more from Ramirez, who reached out to a few scientists, to get their take on cloud seeding's climate angle. Although cloud seeding has been around for decades and is currently being operated in roughly 50 countries, many climate scientists remain skeptical of the technology's efficacy as well as the time and effort put into trying to manipulate weather. Swain pointed out it has been historically difficult to design scientific experiments to test the effectiveness of cloud seeding, leaving behind a trail of unclear, intangible evidence on what the benefits are. \"How do you know how much precipitation that might actually end up falling from that cloud occurred due to the seeding? Or how much would have fallen without the seeding?\" Swain told CNN. \"This isn't a setting where you can do a truly controlled experiment.\" Cloud seeding experiments typically deal with a narrow set of parameters, according to Swain, taking into account weather conditions including cloud cover, time of the day, and location. Additionally, the rapidly changing climate adds another layer to the list of variables. As the planet warms, weather patterns and clouds will constantly evolve, often in unexpected ways. That's what Sarah Tessendorf, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and other researchers from universities and an Idaho power company, set out to examine in 2017. , published in 2020 in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences, managed to quantify how effective cloud seeding is. Yet uncertainties still linger. During the cold winter months in 2017, the researchers flew aircraft to inject silver iodine, the seeding chemical used, into clouds over the Payette Basin in Idaho, while simultaneously using radars and models to measure its impact on snowfall. In three cloud-seeding events, the scientists identified \"unambiguous seeding patterns,\" in cold cloud decks not producing ice at all; but once seeded, ice crystals formed inside mirroring the same pattern the aircraft had flown. They were then able to track the formed ice and snow to the ground and measure how much additional snow fell from the seeded clouds. Despite the results, Tessendorf said more experiments need to be done to improve the technology for it to become a sweeping solution to the climate crisis. The amount of precipitation produced by cloud seeding \u2014 up to 10% \u2014 isn't enough at all to quench the drought-stricken West. \"It could help over the years augment the storage levels in reservoirs, so that when you get into that extract, you might just go into that drought with a little bit more than you would have otherwise,\" she said. \"That to me is the way that cloud seeding should be viewed. It's not going to be the silver bullet, but it could be a helpful tool in a water manager's toolbox.\" When it comes to tackling climate change as a whole, many also question the methods such as the deployment of fossil fuel-powered aircraft to inject silver iodide into clouds, arguing it is counterintuitive to the overall climate goals of slashing fossil fuel emissions. But Tessendorf argued it is a small price to pay in order to improve the technology. \"I will say that the number of aircraft and the duration of these flights to do cloud seeding and the programs that are currently having it done pales in comparison to the number of commercial flights and aircraft we have in the skies all over the world right now,\" she contended. \"So it's to me a drop in the bucket of extra fossil fuels being burned.\" \"But that does not mean that there isn't room for improvement there in order to have more of a clean process,\" Tessendorf added. With the climate crisis accelerating, climate scientists like Swain say resources are much better invested in climate solutions already guaranteed to make significant and equitable impacts. \"There needs to be controlled studies that actually shows it was the seeding that increased the precipitation in a meaningful way,\" Swain asserted. \"The best case scenario is it's a small incremental adjunct to other water-saving or conservation measures during scarce periods, but even that's not clear if it would really work in that capacity in any systematic way.\" CNN meteorologist Judson Jones contributed to this article"},

All the homes are just destroyed,\" Tezeno recounted. She took a long pause; the wound was as fresh as it was that August day in 2020. Tezeno arrived at her Cameron Parish neighborhood fearing the worst, and amid the rubble, there stood her home. It looked unscathed. But Tezeno's feelings of hope were quickly dashed when she opened the door. Inside, it was a very different story. \"The back was all blown out. The AC unit flew off the back of our house. All the siding came off the house, my back porch on my house with two bedrooms and the bathrooms were all caved in,\" Tezeno told CNN. For two years, Tezeno -- a single mother -- and her four children have not been able to move back in as the home gets repaired. She's been living with relatives as she balances what seems like three full-time jobs: her actual full-time job, raising her family, and endlessly dealing with insurance companies. \"This whole thing has taken an emotional toll on me,\" she admitted. Tezeno and her family are preparing to move back in a matter of weeks, which also happens to be right in time for the start of the hurricane season. NOAA is predicting , with 6-10 hurricanes and 3-6 major storms (Category 3 or higher). According to Colorado State University, the chances of Louisiana getting hit with a named storm within 50 miles this season are 84%. \"Oh Jesus, keep us spared,\" Tezeno sighed. As Tezeno and her fellow Louisianans try to mentally prepare for hurricanes yet to come, two years after Laura, Lake Charles -- 45 miles north of Cameron Parish -- still looks like a blue patchwork quilt. \"I still see blue tarps out there, there are plenty of homes and businesses that are still not completely put back together,\" Lake Charles National Weather Service meteorologist Stephen Corbani observed. \"There is a literal PTSD out there in the community,\" explained Lake Charles Mayor Nic Hunter. \"It's a visceral thing.\" The storm cost more than a billion dollars in the state of Louisiana alone, with more than 44,000 households approved by to receive housing assistance. According to , there are still more than 2,000 cases still open in the Lake Charles area -- that's 2,000 families still working to rebuild. \"We have some homes that literally have not been touched since Hurricane Laura,\" Hunter noted. But he told CNN they just got word . \"Though it has taken far too long, there is over a billion dollars in federal aid that has been allocated for hurricanes Laura and Delta. We are immensely thankful for that,\" he added. The previous two hurricane seasons have been particularly cruel for Louisiana. In 2020, , and in 2021, , a Category 4 behemoth, battered the southeastern part of the state on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. The poundings have left residents wary of what lies ahead. \"Certainly, as we approach hurricane season, locals are just a bit more on edge than they were prior to 2020,\" Hunter acknowledged. While it is impossible to know exactly where these storms will make landfall, the forecasts are grim. \"Looking at some of the climate signals that are out there, like , it seems like we're in store for another above normal season, just in terms of numbers and activity across the Atlantic basin,\" Carboni projected. Lake Charles is home for Carboni too, and like Tezeno, he hopes this year's busy season doesn't end up affecting his area, still so vulnerable from two seasons ago. \"The last thing we need would be for another hurricane to affect this area,\" Carboni remarked. If you are in a hurricane zone and are preparing for the upcoming season, hopefully you have a plan for you and your family, as well as a . After talking to Tezeno, though, she expressed some advice I think many times gets overlooked. \"Write down everything that you have. I don't care if it's minor and take pictures of everything that you can and check your policy,\" she urged. She also recommended securing your home if you evacuate. She recalled many of her neighbors fled their homes, only to come back and find it structurally damaged AND everything inside looted. Lastly, she advised having some sort of hurricane savings account. \"Have as much as you can to take care of yourself without relying on insurance, because sometimes they are not as quick to come to your aid as you think.\""},

We had several this year that brought , staggering to the mountains in the west, and even . An atmospheric river is a long, narrow region in the atmosphere that can transport moisture thousands of miles, like a fire hose in the sky. We talk a lot about them in the West because large-scale storm systems bring the region up to 40% of their yearly rainfall. But we started wondering: Is there anywhere else where these happen? Apparently, atmospheric rivers also occur in the eastern US, unleashing a river of moisture like what we will see this week. The reason East Coast atmospheric rivers aren't talked about much isn't because they are rare. In fact, they are quite common. \"Atmospheric rivers are more frequent on the East Coast than they are on the West Coast,\" said Jason Cordeira, Associate Professor of Meteorology at Plymouth State University. \"They're just not as impactful and don't usually produce as much rainfall.\" While Cordeira noted it is tough to give an exact number of how many atmospheric rivers impact the East every year, he says a rough estimate would be anywhere from 80-100 per year! WOW. The West gets about half that number of atmospheric rivers each year, yet they account for double the annual rainfall percentage. \"The West Coast is a much more arid climate. And they usually get precipitation during just half of the year,\" Cordeira pointed out. The East Coast accumulates its annual rainfall from several sources: afternoon storms, cold fronts and hurricanes, which can bring MUCH higher rain amounts than an atmospheric river. \"Some of the strongest atmospheric river events that are perfectly oriented, can produce 6-8 inches of rain,\" Cordeira reported. \"Those totals are dwarfed by the amount of rainfall that we can get from a hurricane.\" Some recent hurricanes such as , have resulted in rainfall totals measured in FEET, not inches. This week's atmospheric river won't leave the footprint Harvey did by any stretch, but it could affect the same areas as Harvey. The Deep South will once again be hit by a series of storms this week, along with the Plains, the Rockies and the Pacific Northwest. So, needless to say, this week's weather will be much more far-reaching. It has no doubt been a super active stretch of severe weather in the South and Southeast, as this is the fourth week in a row where active weather is affecting the same areas. However, as we get deeper into April and May, we should start to see the storm tracks shift a little farther north into what is traditionally, \"Tornado Alley,\" which is what we will begin to see this week. A series of storm systems will impact the US this week from coast to coast. It will bring everything from blizzard conditions to tornadoes to flash flooding, an exhausting week to say the least. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) has placed a Level 3 out of 5 \"enhanced risk\" of severe weather today for central Arkansas, however, anywhere from San Antonio to the Ohio Valley could see storms today. The extreme northeast of Texas, southeast Oklahoma and western and central Arkansas, including Little Rock, are under a tornado watch until 11 p.m. CT Monday. Large hail -- possibly greater than baseball size -- and wind gusts to 70 mph are also a concern for the area. While this is happening in the central part of the country, a robust system will be entering the Pacific Northwest, and will crisscross the country in dramatic fashion today, bringing heavy rain to the coastal areas of Washington, Oregon and California, and several feet of snow for the Cascades. \"This system will deepen as it moves farther inland, setting the stage for an intense late season winter storm to impact the Rockies and Northern Plains,\" noted the Weather Prediction Center (WPC). \"Over a foot of snow is likely to accumulate between eastern Montana and central North Dakota on Tuesday.\" Blizzard warnings are in effect for portions of the Dakotas and Montana from Tuesday through Thursday. \"Total snow accumulations between 12 and 24 inches [are forecast],\" said the National Weather Service (NWS) office in Bismarck. \"Winds gusting as high as 50 mph [are also possible].\" The heavy snow and high winds will make travel nearly impossible for those areas due to whiteout conditions and will also create avalanche dangers. Many of the western mountain ranges have some sort of avalanche danger today, so be sure to check before heading out, especially in the backcountry. We wrote a story earlier in the season about what causes extreme avalanche dangers and why you only have about 15-30 minutes to be found alive after burial. Click to read more. After the system blankets the West with its late-season dump of snow, the storm will amplify as it heads east. It will combine with the available moisture provided by the atmospheric river we talked about and will result in the perfect setup for severe weather. The tornado threat will be even stronger for Tuesday and Wednesday in the midsection of the country. But the storms will be impacting areas much farther north than the previous rounds of severe weather we have seen during the last three weeks. Tuesday there is again a Level 3 out of 5 \"enhanced\" risk of severe storms from Dallas to Omaha, which includes more than 16 million people. While it is the area with the highest likelihood of storms, nearly 40 million people will have some possibility of seeing storms. \"Any thunderstorms that can develop in this very favorable thermodynamic environment will likely become severe quickly,\" the SPC advised. They mentioned any (strong thunderstorm) will be capable of producing tornadoes, saying \"some of the tornadoes could be strong.\" By Wednesday, we enter Day Three of this multiday severe event. The main threat area will shift east with the third day of a Level 3 out of 5 \"enhanced risk\" of severe weather. The bullseye will be from northern Louisiana to the south side of Chicago and include places like Shreveport, Little Rock, Memphis, St. Louis, and Indianapolis. \"Large to very large hail, damaging winds and tornadoes will all be possible,\" said the SPC. \"Strong tornadoes may occur.\" Dallas, Houston, New Orleans, and Chicago could all see storms as well. The good news is the severe threat will be over in time for Easter weekend. We could still see some lingering showers in the eastern half of the country, and some mountain snow in the Rockies, which could affect egg hunts and sunrise services. While things could change between now and then, right now the SPC doesn't have any areas highlighted for severe weather during Easter weekend as of now. As if severe storms and blizzard conditions weren't enough of a headline this week, extremely cold air will follow the front, plunging overnight temperatures into the single digits is forecast for portions of the northern Plains. \"Low temperatures in the single digits are possible and this could cause issues,\" said the NWS office in Billings. \"Do not be deceived by the sun, it is going to be fighting a very cold airmass.\" And as the climate crisis continues to change the dynamics of our weather, expect atmospheric rivers to become more intense as well. \"It's expected that as the air temperatures increase, the air can hold more water vapor and therefore any storms that are comprised of water vapor will have more of it,\" Cordeira explained. \"So, an atmospheric river, which is defined as a region of water vapor, will likely become more intense. Their frequency may not be more common, but their intensity could become larger.\" The drought-stricken West is getting even drier, according to the latest . \"Central Washington, Idaho, and northwest Montana also saw increases in drought extent or severity as short-term dryness continues to build upon long-term moisture deficits extending back to last year,\" according to the drought monitor. \"Many parts of southern Idaho, and the rest of the West, have set records for the driest three-month period (January to March) going back 100 years or more.\" Texas is also facing extreme drought with 95% of the state in some level of drought. At 26,000 square miles, Texas has more \"exceptional drought\" area than any other state, per the latest US Drought Monitor. The 26,000 square miles of exceptional drought is larger than the state of West Virginia (or more than three times the size of Massachusetts). The drought is only making fire conditions worse. From Texas to Kansas, there will be an extreme fire danger especially on Tuesday, as dry conditions and winds topping 50 mph will cover the area.

New cases reported among children in the last week of August were 14% higher than they were two weeks earlier, tracked by the American Academy of Pediatrics. They jumped even more in the South, where classes have been in session for weeks. In contrast, overall cases for all ages were down about 17% in the same timeframe. Experts say that this increased transmission is to be expected -- but that keeping kids in school should be the priority, and there are now enough ways to make sure it's done safely. \"We do see infectious diseases spread every time the school year starts. That's been a phenomenon well-known long before Covid,\" said Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the pediatric association's committee on infectious diseases. \"The good news is, we're in a much different place with this pandemic than we were two years ago, or even last year, in terms of the percentage of the population that's vaccinated.\" Eligibility for Covid-19 vaccines was expanded to include ages 5 to 11 in November, making this the first full school year in which all school-age children could have their initial series. Still, vaccination rates for children lag and have changed little recently: About 61% of children ages 12 to 17 and just 31% of children 5 to 11 have their initial series, compared with about 77% of adults, from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Children 5 and up are also eligible for a booster shot, but only those 12 and up can get the updated version. And so far, only about 10% of children ages 5 to 17 have gotten a booster. The slow rollout of vaccines for children is part of why pediatric cases became more prevalent during last school year, said Dr. Grace Lee, pediatrics professor at Stanford University School of Medicine and chair of the CDC's vaccine advisory committee. In 2020, there wasn't much virus circulating among children because most were learning from home, she said. But the negative effects of remote learning were coming into focus. conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics found that test scores among 9-year-olds plummeted in math and reading after the pandemic. And mental health-related visits to emergency rooms among adolescents saw a steep increase. \"We needed the kids to go back in person for learning. At the same time, we didn't have as many opportunities to offer vaccination in a timely manner to those who were going back to school. So that is really challenging,\" Lee said. \"Part of the reason we saw case rates jump up in pediatrics is because they were the last population to get vaccinated.\" Now, though, there's greater population immunity built up through a combination of vaccination and infection. About 4 out of 5 children in the US have had Covid-19 at some point, from the CDC that are based on the presence of antibodies in blood samples. This is a significant jump from the end of 2021, when 45% of children were estimated to have had Covid-19. That doesn't mean the potential for Covid to spread in schools should be ignored, experts say; it was still a top 10 cause of death for children last year, and there's too much uncertainty about what's to come. \"We've now been infected, vaccinated, infected, vaccinated. Where are we going this season? I do think that we have to take it one year, one month at a time,\" Lee said. Last year, the CDC updated its school guidance to prioritize in-person learning while maintaining layered prevention strategies such as masking, physical distancing and vaccinations for those who were eligible. Last month, the guidance was updated again, dropping recommendations for programs that require a negative test to stay in the classroom or restrict kids to one classroom, or cohort. Mask mandates have dropped across the county, too. However, while the CDC and others are more generally focused on preventing severe disease from Covid-19, experts say there are still benefits to avoiding infection, especially for kids in school. \"We have to really take a life course approach with children,\" Lee said, thinking about both the short- and long-term effects. In the short term, a Covid-19 infection \"completely disrupts your family life and your school life and your personal life,\" she said. \"Every time someone gets sick -- whether it's Covid or flu or anything else -- they're getting further and further behind,\" she said. And \"the burden of infection is not equitable,\" causing disparities to grow. Children can have long Covid, too -- a direct long-term risk of infection. And if enough teachers get sick, the indirect risks from the early days of school closures can resurface. As a parent herself, Lee recommends that kids continue to wear masks in schools and keep up-to-date with any vaccines they're eligible for. \"I would say kids have been the most adaptable during the pandemic. So I'm less worried about that piece of it,\" Lee said. \"My hope is that we make schools a safe and equitable place to continue to learn and that we support our children, no matter what happens.\""},

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center on Tuesday forecast 14 to 21 named storms, six to 10 hurricanes and three to six major hurricanes -- of Category 3 strength or greater. The 2020 and 2021 seasons both exhausted the hurricane name list and broke records. No one can say for sure if this year will be similar, but in early April, , which were right in line with what NOAA is forecasting. The CSU forecast called for 19 named storms, nine hurricanes and four major storms. After back-to-back years of using all the hurricane names and resorting to the Greek alphabet, the World Meteorological Organization decided to do away with using the Greek alphabet and to be used if all the hurricane names are exhausted once again. Of course it's impossible to know how many of those storms will make landfall along the US coast, or where the largest storms will develop. However, during the announcement, NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad recognized that the current hurricane cycle for the Atlantic is a busy one. \"If you go back two years, the 2020 hurricane season broke records across the board and it's the most active season on record with 30 named storms,\" said Spinrad. \"The 2021 hurricane season, which is the third most active year on record in terms of names of storms brought us 21 named storms with impacts, ranging from the Appalachian Mountains all the way to New England, resulting in over $78.5 billion in US damage.\" There are several contributing factors that play into a \"busy\" hurricane season. \"We are in an active period,\" said Spinrad. \"There are certain ingredients that drive the intensity and the frequency of hurricanes.\" One is the existing in the equatorial Pacific. This phenomenon creates cooler-than-average ocean temperatures around the equator in the Pacific and results in weather impacts around the globe. La Ni\u00f1a presents favorable conditions for hurricanes -- in contrast to that of El Ni\u00f1o. Hurricane seasons under El Ni\u00f1o conditions are known for upper-level wind patterns across the Caribbean that tear hurricanes apart as they try to form, making the seasons less active. Another reason for the above-normal forecast is the location of what's called the \"Gulf Loop Current.\" This current is \"a 600-foot-deep river of hot Caribbean water that travels between Cancun, Mexico and western Cuba into the Gulf,\" said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. This loop current is flowing farther north now, forcing warm water at deeper levels of the ocean to travel closer to the coastal areas along the Gulf of Mexico. \"The warm water is simply too deep and the hurricane has an unlimited supply of hot water for intensification,\" said Myers. Forecasters are comparing the position of the loop current with where it was placed in the record-breaking 2005 season -- when Hurricanes Katrina and Rita both made landfall. \"Yes, the loop current does look like 2005,\" said Matthew Rosencrans, lead hurricane season outlook forecaster with NOAA's Climate Prediction Center. \"But it depends if a storm actually moves over that loop current and forecasting the specific track of storms is not something we can do beyond a week time frame,\" Rosencrans added. During the 2021 hurricane season, eight storms made landfall along the US Gulf Coast and in 2020 six made landfall along the Gulf. In 2020, and both slammed into southwest Louisiana, making landfall roughly 15 miles apart. \"In 2021, ripped through Southeast Louisiana, then caused more . \"Hurricane Ida spanned nine states, demonstrating that anyone can be in the direct path of a hurricane and in danger from the remnants of a storm system,\" said FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. \"It's important for everyone to understand their risk.\""},
{"url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/09/health/abortion-restrictions-texas/index.html", "title": "Why a woman's doctor warned her not to get pregnant in Texas", "paragraphs": " Nine years ago, Cade DeSpain messaged a friend about a cute girl he saw on her Facebook feed. The friend introduced him to Kailee Lingo, her sorority sister at Tarleton State University in Stephenville, Texas. Kailee remembers that when she and Cade met, it was \"a connection at first sight.\" A month after college graduation, Kailee and Cade married in Marble Falls, Texas. They're both proud to be native Texans: Kailee's family has lived there for generations, and Cade's ancestors are among Texas' \"Old Three Hundred,\" the original families that joined Stephen F. Austin to settle the area in the 1800s. At the time, the DeSpains were both passionately anti-abortion. \"I was just your quintessential pro-life Texan,\" Kailee, 29, told CNN in a recent interview. \"I was raised in central Texas by extremely Republican parents and grandparents,\" Cade, 31, said. \"One hundred percent pro-life.\" Kailee and Cade have supported abortion rights since 2016, when she had a miscarriage at 16 weeks and was hospitalized for severe complications, including blood clots and infection. It was one of three miscarriages she had in the early years of marriage. \"It made me realize that pregnancy can be dangerous,\" she said. \"It made me think of my little sisters, and I wanted them to be able to have a choice if they ever had to go through something like that.\" Last September, when a restrictive anti-abortion law took effect in Texas, Kailee pleaded on Facebook for people to contact their elected representatives to protect abortion rights. In November, Kailee and Cade were overjoyed to learn that she was pregnant. Full of hope, they posted ultrasound pictures and a gender reveal video of a cannon shooting out blue confetti. They named their baby boy Finley. Then, about three months later, they learned that Finley had heart, lung, brain, kidney and genetic defects and would either be stillborn or die within minutes of birth. Carrying him to term put Kailee at high risk for severe pregnancy complications, including blood clots, preeclampsia and cancer. Even so, they could not get an abortion in Texas and fled to New Mexico. \"I've never felt more betrayed by a place I was once so proud to be from,\" Kailee said through tears. \"How could you be so cruel as to pass a law that you know will hurt women and that you know will cause babies to be born in pain?\" she added. \"How is that humane? How is that saving anybody?\" CNN emailed Texas lawmakers who authored or sponsored the state's anti-abortion laws. None of them responded to CNN's questions. When Kailee and Cade found out she was pregnant, they desperately hoped for a \"sticky baby\" -- a pregnancy that would stick -- after her three miscarriages. But after multiple ultrasounds, the doctors' prognosis was grim: His heart, lung, kidney and brain problems were severe, and his genetic disorder, called , meant he had an extra set of chromosomes. The doctors said that either Finley would die before birth, or if he did make it to term, he would die a few minutes or at most an hour after birth. One of their doctors told them, \"Some of these things could be fixed, but all of these things together -- this cannot be fixed,\" Kailee remembers. She says the doctor told them that before Texas' went into effect in September of last year, she would have advised abortion as \"the safest course for you [and] the most humane course of action for him.\" But the doctor said she could not offer them an abortion in Texas. She said the only option to get one was to travel out of state. Staying pregnant with Finley could have put Kailee's life in danger. She has two blood clotting disorders, which put her at a higher risk for having dangerous blood clots during pregnancy. Plus, mothers of babies with triploidy are more likely to get preeclampsia, a potentially deadly pregnancy disorder. Also, there was an increased risk for a associated with cancer. Kailee said she considered risking her own life to carry Finley to term. \"I [wanted] to say goodbye,\" she said. \"I [wanted] a chance to hold him.\" But then she thought about how Finley would suffer as he struggled to breathe. \"He's going to suffocate, he's going to die, and I'm going to watch him do it,\" she said. For Cade, there was only one option: It made no sense to him to risk his wife's life to have a baby who was certain to die quickly. Cade told Kailee, \" 'I will support you whatever decision that you make, but I really don't want to lose both of you, ' \" Kailee remembers. The couple opted for abortion, driving 10 hours to a clinic in New Mexico. The procedure and travel cost $3,500. They hoped their insurance would cover the procedure, but Texas , and the clinic told them their insurance company declined to pay. The DeSpains didn't have enough money -- Kailee said she was docked pay at work because she'd had too many sick days -- so Cade asked a relative he describes as \"the epitome of the Trump fanboy\" to give them the $3,500. The relative relented when Cade said that without the abortion, he could end up a widower at age 30. Cade said he didn't like asking for the money, but \"my job as a husband is to protect and love my wife. If I'm not fighting to keep her here, then I failed.\" Kailee had the abortion in March, when she was 19 weeks pregnant. While legislators did not respond to CNN's questions about Kailee's case, the president of Texas Right to Life did. John Seago said that \"Texas law is very clear about what circumstances that an abortion could be performed\" and that \"what happened to [Kailee] and the response of her physicians was absolutely a misrepresentation of the law. And this should never have happened.\" But Katie Keith, director of the Health Policy and the Law Initiative at Georgetown University Law Center, said -- the one that took effect last year and another one that went into effect last month -- are not at all clear and are \"designed to be purposely vague and broad.\" The more recent , for example, says an abortion can be performed if the mother \"has a life-threatening physical condition aggravated, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that places the female at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.\" \"They don't spell out exactly the situations when an abortion can be provided,\" Keith said. Kailee said her doctors told her they could give her an abortion only if she were at imminent risk of dying -- essentially, if she were \" 'dying on the table.' \" If a physician is found in violation of the law, the punishments can be severe: heavy fines, loss of their medical license and a possible life sentence in prison. Plus, citizens can file lawsuits against physicians they think have performed an illegal abortion, and if they win, they can get a $10,000 reward. If the citizen is wrong and the doctor wins the lawsuit, the doctor still has to pay their own legal fees, as Texas law specifically forbids doctors from recouping fees from plaintiffs. \"Facing the potential to become a felon and face life in prison for simply trying to take care of patients has been horrifying, and I'd be lying if I said that I haven't considered leaving the state,\" said Dr. Leah Tatum, a spokesperson for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists who practices in Austin, Texas, and has treated patients in similar situations to Kailee's since the Texas anti-abortion laws passed. The that went into effect last year barred most abortions at the onset of fetal cardiac activity, which can occur as early as six weeks into pregnancy and before many people know they are pregnant. It was one of the earliest and most restrictive abortion laws. that ban abortion or severely restrict the procedure have gone into effect in about a dozen states after the US Supreme Court ended a constitutional right to abortion on June 24. Kailee says that the last time she saw her obstetrician, she advised her not to get pregnant in Texas. \"She said 'this is not safe,' \" Kailee remembers. \" She said, 'I need you to look at me. I need you to understand that if you get pregnant in Texas and that if you have complications, that I cannot intervene until I can prove that you're going to die.' \" The DeSpains say they are thinking about leaving Texas, but it would be difficult to leave their work and their families. Kailee said they're sharing their story in hopes of increasing awareness so \"that stories like mine can change enough voters' perspectives.\" \"I'm still so angry and hurt about it that I can hardly see straight,\" she wrote on the day after the abortion. \"Finley and I were simply collateral damage in a much bigger picture. It's hard for me to wrap my head around the thought process of lawmakers that would rather a full-term baby suffocate to death than allow a mother to make a decision that spares her child that pain.\" CNN's Nadia Kounang and John Bonifield contributed to this report."},

Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain. The \"Ironhand\" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they don't have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks. Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%. The Swedish company describes the system as a \"soft exoskeleton.\" Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance. Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove. \"When you have the glove on, it provides strength and reduces the effort needed when lifting objects,\" says Mikael Wester, Bioservo's marketing director. \"It's all in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run.\" The system consists of a backpack, which houses the power pack, and artificial tendons that connect to the glove. There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip. Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses. Each Ironhand system costs around \u20ac6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the , costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product. The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. \"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team. \"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\" Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations. The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from . \"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\" This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system."},

One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple. Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024. TuSimple's latest road test involved hauling fresh produce 951 miles, from Nogales, Arizona to Oklahoma City. The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. \"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still , TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software.  \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. According to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads.  The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. That doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu. Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.  TuSimple has prominent competitors, such as Google spinoff Waymo and Uber-backed Aurora, but those are working on a wider range of self-driving vehicles, including passenger cars. TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark.  Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said.  Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.\""}
