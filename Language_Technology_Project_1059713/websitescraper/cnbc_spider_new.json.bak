But she was also aware that many of those high-priced deals created an albatross for the recipients, who now face a new and gloomy reality.</p>", "<p>\"There was a reset that happened,\" said Ross, who declined to disclose additional terms of her deal<strong>, </strong>including valuation. \"We were just fortunate not to have gotten caught up in what happened the year before.\"</p>", "<p>The number of financings of startups valued at $1 billion or more almost tripled last year to more than 600, with the amount invested in those deals climbing to $140.8 billion from $52.7 billion in 2020, according to the <a href=\"https://nvca.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/NVCA-2022-Yearbook-Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">National Venture Capital Association</a>. As Ross points out, some companies with $10 million in annual sales were obtaining billion-dollar valuations, giving them revenue multiples of 100.</p>", "<p>Those days are over.

In the secondary markets, where employees and ex-employees from private companies sell a portion of their equity to get some liquidity, deals are \"getting done at more favorable terms for investors,\" said <a href=\"https://equitybee.com/\" target=\"_blank\">EquityBee</a> CEO Oren Barzilai.</p>", "<p>EquityBee connects startup workers with outside investors who are willing to write checks so people can exercise their options, generally after leaving a company. In return, the investors demand the right to a certain amount of the equity in the case of an initial public offering or acquisition. Barzilai said that investors are now often getting 30% to 40% of the potential upside, compared with 5% to 10% a year ago.</p>", "<p>\"The trends have shifted,\" Barzilai said. \"Companies that were super hot last year are not as favorable as they used to be.\"</p>", "<p>Late-stage companies that are raising money generally have to either take Klarna's path and accept a lower valuation or give highly preferential treatment to new investors, allowing them to get their money back before anyone else or make a higher return in an eventual exit event.</p>", "<p>Startups more often tend to take the latter route, accepting what's known on Wall Street as \"structure\" into their financing deals. Larry Aschebrook, managing partner at growth stage venture firm <a href=\"https://gsquared.com/\" target=\"_blank\">G Squared</a>, said his team isn't putting money into any deal without \"downside protection.\"</p>", "<p>\"You might get a top-line number that is either flat or up depending on the underlying business, but there are some embedded protections,\" said Aschebrook, adding that his firm's level of cash deployment is down about 60% from a year ago. \"In the last few years, very few businesses had any structure in equity rounds given how accessible the capital markets were.\"</p>", "<p>Cube is at an earlier stage and isn't as directly effected by the whims of the stock market. Still, Ross faced questions this year that she didn't as recently as early 2021, when her company raised its $10 million <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/cube-raises-10m-more-to-help-companies-plan-their-financial-future/\" target=\"_blank\">Series A</a>. For example, investors are asking if the company will have enough cash to last 36 months, whereas previous demands were for the money to last 18 to 24 months, Ross said. Also, profitability is important even for young companies with fast growth.</p>", "<p>\"The diligence was a lot deeper, particularly on metrics that never would've come up before like margins,\" Ross said. Investors also asked about sales efficiency and net dollar retention, or how much existing customers are keeping and adding to their purchases. \"These weren't even questions that were asked last time around,\" she said.</p>", "<p>Christina Cacioppo, CEO of compliance and security software startup <a href=\"https://www.vanta.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Vanta</a>, raised <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210504005122/en/Vanta-Raises-50-Million-in-Series-A-Funding-Led-by-Sequoia\" target=\"_blank\">money</a> in 2021 and took on <a href=\"https://siliconangle.com/2022/06/08/vanta-raises-110m-1-6b-valuation-simplify-cybersecurity-compliance/\" target=\"_blank\">another round</a> in May in what she called \"a very different fundraising environment.\"</p>", "<p>Last year, revenue growth was the favorite subject among venture capitalists assessing Vanta. In 2022, Cacioppo said, it was the burn multiple, a measurement described in a <a href=\"https://medium.com/craft-ventures/the-burn-multiple-51a7e43cb200\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> by David Sacks of Craft Ventures, one of Vanta's backers. The number represents the amount of money a company spends in order to generate a dollar of new recurring revenue.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"If you're not growing efficiently, there are not many people who want to fund that in this market,\" Cacioppo said. Her company was valued at $1.6 billion in the latest round.</p>", "<p>Investors are now routinely asking for a company's so-called \"magic number.\" That <a href=\"https://www.kpisense.com/blog/magic-number\" target=\"_blank\">calculation</a> factors in the growth of revenue over time relative to sales and marketing expenditures, and tells prospective investors how long it will take for a company to recoup every dollar it spends in those areas.</p>", "<p>Raj Verma, CEO of database startup <a href=\"https://www.singlestore.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SingleStore</a>, said such calculations were a hot topic with investors as his company was pursuing its latest round of funding, which will be announced later this month. SingleStore raised an $80 million round in September.</p>", "<p>Verma said this time around investors wanted to know how long it takes for a sales representative to become productive, the ratio of account executives to sales engineers, and the number of salespeople who contributed to meeting a goal for annualized recurring revenue.</p>", "<p>He said it takes 14 times more money to generate revenue from a new customer than from an existing client, making dollar-based net retention rate an increasingly important figure.</p>", "<p>It's \"the one metric that people are bringing thousand watt bulbs to,\" Verma said.</p>", "<p>The bottom line for investors is they want to have confidence that the money they're putting in can last a while, because the era of cheap and readily available cash is over. And they want to enter at a price that reflects the public market shakeout.</p>", "<p><a href=\"https://www.indexventures.com/team/mike-volpi/\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Volpi</a> of Index Ventures said that while deal activity has slowed across the board, there is much more action in the earlier stages than in the growth equity market, where there's \"very little liquidity.\"</p>", "<p>Volpi said that there are no longer Series A rounds valuing companies at $200 million, but they're still historically high, in the $50 million to $100 million range, which is back to about 2018 levels.</p>", "<p>Due diligence is also back.</p>", "<p>\"The timeframe on which deals get done is a little longer now, which is healthy for both companies and VC firms,\" Volpi said. \"It gives us more opportunity to evaluate an idea, talk to people and do reference checks. For the company, it helps them figure out which VC they actually like.\"</p>", "<p>As for Index's advice to its portfolio companies, Volpi said companies should adjust based on what they're seeing from their customers. But if clients are continuing to spend and the business has money to last a couple years, don't change just because the market has contracted.</p>", "<p>\"We're encouraging people to keep doing what they're doing, because the world will be in a different place in two years,\" he said. \"If you're seeing signs of customers changing then adjust. But if not, and you have capital, don't get freaked out. While everyone else is getting freaked out, this is the opportunity to take share.\"</p>", "<p>WATCH: <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/06/17/tech-is-a-great-long-term-investment-but-expect-bumps-in-the-road-says-former-aol-ceo.html\">Tech is a great long-term investment but expect bumps in the road</a></p>"], "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/07/startups-reckoning-with-an-end-to-cheap-capital-face-hard-decisions-.html"},

Chief technology officer Curt Garner notes that Chipotle, inspired by Uber, first went digital in 2016 with its app and then quickly built space at each of its restaurants so employees wouldn't ever have to choose between serving customers standing in front of them versus those who ordered digitally. But investing in globe-altering innovation took on new meaning for Chipotle in April when it launched Cultivate Next, its $50 million venture fund intended to soothe the margin-squeezing pressures of the restaurant sector, tackling challenges from labor shortages to rising food costs and enticing customers to spend more time eating in their stores.</p>", "<p>\"We're thinking about how to grow and scale the company through a lot of lenses,\" said Garner, noting that the fund represents an opportunity for Chipotle to evolve from merely adapting to technological change to creating it. \"There's restaurant growth, there's growing and scaling our digital business and there's also continuing the mission of cultivating a better world and changing the way people think about where their food comes from.\"</p>", "<p>Chipotle's new venture fund could be a beacon for investors as the restaurant sector continues to fight significant economic headwinds. Analysts will be looking for concrete examples of Garner's first two points \u2014 new tech that promises to streamline and expand Chipotle's operations \u2014 when Chipotle reports its second quarter results on July 26.</p>", "<p>Chipotle has generally posted positive growth numbers since 2016 when the chain was dealing with food safety scares \u2014 it experienced near double-digit systemwide sales growth between 2017 and 2020, according to Morningstar. But it's not immune to today's broader market downswing. While consensus estimates are calling for Chipotle to post second quarter revenue of $2.24 billion, up nearly 19% year over year, and quarterly earnings of $9.04 per share, up 21%, its stock is down more than 20% year-to-date.</p>", "<p>\"The trouble is on the margins side,\" said Sean Dunlop, equities analyst with Morningstar. </p>", "<p>While Chipotle and the restaurant sector have seen a slight softening of comparable store sales growth, the rising costs of food, labor and utilities combined with a trend of consumers venturing out of their homes less \"is pinching Chipotle's P&amp;L,\" Dunlop said, noting that the squeeze will likely last into 2024. Owner-operated chains like Chipotle and Starbucks may also be faring worse than franchised businesses because \"they bear all those below-the-line costs themselves,\" he added.</p>", "<p>Another potential hurdle for Chipotle's stock: <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/23/chipotle-restaurant-in-maine-files-petition-for-union-election-.html\">unionizing workers</a>.

Chipotle's executive team found itself being pitched all kinds of ideas but had no formal funnel to sift through opportunities either as a supplier or partner, said Garner.</p>", "<p>Record venture investment in restaurant technology \u2014 including hardware and software for restaurant management, bookings, staffing, mobile payments and inventory management \u2014 reached more than $4 billion in 2021, and it is on track to beat that this year. Hundreds of companies have expressed interest in Chipotle's first round, which targets seed funds to series B startups.</p>", "<p>Garner said Chipotle will announce its first picks in the next few weeks. Industry watchers say to expect Chipotle's money to follow industry pain points.</p>", "<p>\"After the pandemic a lot of folks are making investments to modernize and improve customer experiences and doing things to take labor costs down and out of the operation,\" said Eric Symon, vice president of the Enterprise Process Innovation Center at Panasonic System Solutions Company of North America.</p>", "<p>Symon is seeing demand for solutions like Panasonic's temperature-controlled smart food lockers that deter take-away theft and mix-ups, which tie up employees who have to remake orders. He is also seeing demand for artificial intelligence apps to help restaurant managers forecast busy times of day so they can better staff their shops.</p>", "<p>To that end, Chipotle has already invested in an AI-powered labor management tool that analyzes dozens of variables like weather and available promotions to determine more efficient restaurant staffing. It's also rolling out an AI-based training program, which helps restaurant workers to move up the ladder to management.</p>", "<p>When it comes to the type of innovation that Chipotle is looking to foster, Garner nods to Chippy, a robotic tortilla chip maker that saves time and labor costs by handling repetitive kitchen tasks.</p>", "<p>\"It started with, 'how do we remove some of the dreariness of a worker standing at the fryer and frying chip basket after chip basket?'\" Garner said, noting that Chippy will be piloted at one Chipotle location later this year once it becomes certified as food safe. \"It allows our crew to spend more time doing culinary tests, serving guests.\"</p>", "<p>Chippy might help Chipotle deal with the industry's labor shortage, but ultimately what the company is aiming for with its venture fund is changing the world's food systems.</p>", "<p>\"When you think about the environmental opportunities for how food is sourced and how it's served, those are huge areas for technology to be accelerated and enabled,\" Garner said, specifically pointing to environmentally focused farming techniques coming out of Europe. \"Guests want to understand the provenance of their food and feel good about what they're shopping for.\"</p>", "<p>Buying into sustainable farming practices will allow quick service restaurants brands better affordability of ingredients, a guaranteed supply, and the opportunity to offer customers something unique vs. competitors, said Sanjeev Krishnan, chief investment officer at S2G Ventures, a 9-year-old venture fund dedicated to supporting sustainable and healthy food systems.</p>", "<p>\"More interesting is that these quick serve restaurants can bring an era of biodiversity into our food system \u2014 ours is boring,\" Krishnan said. \"Just 15 crop plants provide 90% of the world's food energy intake, with three \u2014 rice, maize and wheat \u2014 making up two-thirds of this,\" he added.</p>", "<p>Investment in non-meat protein products has ballooned over the past few years, with Chipotle, McDonald's, Burger King and Dunkin all recently trialing burger and sausage substitutes on their menus. Many brands are extending plant-based experimentation to other product categories, and PitchBook Data tracks venture funding in a newish category: 3D bioprinting, which involves printing living cells, growth factors and other biomaterials to produce whole cut cultivated meat, according to the firm's Q1 Foodtech Report. 3D food-printer companies logged $185.7 million in VC funding last year, it said.</p>", "<p>When it comes to investing in higher-risk emerging technology, it may help to think of Chipotle's role as akin to other companies' R&amp;D costs, according to Dunlop. </p>", "<p>\"Nothing is off the table,\" Garner said. \"One of the things that [CEO Brian Niccol] has brought to our culture is this idea that we have a lot of pride in what we do and very little ego. We can be proud of what we've done \u2014 like plant-based chorizo \u2014 but if someone out there has a cool idea, we want to hear from them.\"</p>"], "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/07/chipotles-50-million-search-for-the-future-of-fast-food.html"},
